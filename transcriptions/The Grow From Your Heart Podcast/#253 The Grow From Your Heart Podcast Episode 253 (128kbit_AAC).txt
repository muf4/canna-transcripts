[SPEAKER_07]: It's Thursday and that means it's time for
another throwback Thursday episode of the
[SPEAKER_07]: Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Before we get to the old episodes,
let me make a quick disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I mention any advertising, any
giveaways, any promotions or any contests,
[SPEAKER_07]: all of that stuff has expired.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are no advertisements, promotions,
giveaways or contests that are valid in
[SPEAKER_07]: these old episodes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to thank you guys for listening and
with no further ado, here's a block of old
[SPEAKER_07]: episodes of the Grow From Your Heart
podcast.
Welcome
[SPEAKER_07]: back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is time for episode number 123 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_07]: for cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, if you're a new grower,
if you're a professional grower,
[SPEAKER_07]: if you're a news smoker or a dedicated
dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or
[SPEAKER_07]: even someone who's just curious about the
current state of cannabis, this my friends
[SPEAKER_07]: is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm your host, my friends call me roster
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to thank you once again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_07]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_07]: Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for letting me use their music
on my show.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big shout out to Kat, Koot and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to dedicate this episode to my
friend Zach.
[SPEAKER_07]: We lost Zach to cystic fibrosis this
month.
[SPEAKER_07]: So fuck you cystic fibrosis and Zach,
I miss you and I love you brother.
[SPEAKER_07]: This dab is for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to take a little dab because
Zach had cystic fibrosis and it messed
[SPEAKER_07]: with his lungs really badly.
[SPEAKER_07]: If he took too big of a dab, he would
sound just like the bong.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to take a little dab for
him.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to breathe in some love.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to blow out some bullshit.
[SPEAKER_07]: This dab is for you brother Zach.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody dab with me.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a big nice dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: Zach, I'm going to miss you brother.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to be the same.
[SPEAKER_07]: Much love, much respect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Tim also if you're listening.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tim, I hope we get together sometime soon
and celebrate Zach.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you
for joining me.
[SPEAKER_07]: This episode will come mostly from the
Canna Canyon.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Canna Canyon is my favorite cannabis
social lounge.
[SPEAKER_07]: In Colorado Springs where we are allowed
to congregate and socialize and smoke
[SPEAKER_07]: recreational cannabis like a responsible
adult should be allowed to.
[SPEAKER_07]: So before I get to that, I want to talk
about something I've been seeing on
[SPEAKER_07]: Facebook.
[SPEAKER_07]: The cannabis cup for Colorado has been
canceled for the year 2016.
[SPEAKER_07]: There will be no cannabis cup over the 420
weekend.
[SPEAKER_07]: High Times intended to have the event in
Denver, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: Adams County, I believe it was,
rejected all of the permits and would not
[SPEAKER_07]: let High Times have their event.
[SPEAKER_07]: High Times had to scramble to find a new
location for the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_07]: They opted to try Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_07]: They put in applications for permits.
[SPEAKER_07]: They decided through that process that
there would not be enough time to
[SPEAKER_07]: advertise and organize a cannabis cup
should the event be approved.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what I've seen a lot on Facebook is
people bitching out High Times and people
[SPEAKER_07]: bitching out the city of Pueblo and people
bitching out the city of Denver for a
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis cup not happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey guys, this was a huge event.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of risk involved.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't blame any city for an event not
happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe Denver, they did kick High Times
out.
[SPEAKER_07]: They did not approve the permit.
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe we can be mad at them,
but it is not High Times' fault nor is it
[SPEAKER_07]: Pueblo's fault that this event did not
happen in the backup plan of Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_07]: High Times submitted the permits and High
Times also pulled the permits.
[SPEAKER_07]: They decided, or the applications for
permits, they decided to stop the process.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there wasn't enough time to get an
event together even if Pueblo did approve.
[SPEAKER_07]: So High Times just decided to pull the
plug.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't blame it on anybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's quit pointing fingers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's all be friends again.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get back together.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's dab like we used to.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's be a community.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I have to say about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: We will talk a little bit about this in
the episode when my friends join me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Since there is no cannabis cup,
you guys let me invite you to the Secret
[SPEAKER_07]: Sesh.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Secret Sesh is hosted by Gatsby
Gardens.
[SPEAKER_07]: We will have a ton of great sponsors.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our friend Adam Ill is coming from
California to host the event.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will be there.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Grammy Gatsby will be there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our friend Dude It's Damsel will be there.
[SPEAKER_07]: There will be a lot of people there
dabbing, vending, having a grand 420 time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you can join us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Follow Secret Sesh Colorado on Instagram
for more information.
[SPEAKER_07]: As soon as I have more info, I will get it
to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, I talked about doing an episode
about what you could do if you came to
[SPEAKER_07]: Pueblo for the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, there's no point in doing that
because you're not going to come here
[SPEAKER_07]: because there's not a cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I apologize for teasing you about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: If there's something you'd like to know
about the city of Pueblo, Colorado,
[SPEAKER_07]: send me an email,
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will answer the email and we'll talk
about Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people are talking about moving
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some things that you should know
and things you probably didn't think of.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll talk about those.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, you guys, I think it is time
for us to time warp.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to travel back in time to just
a couple of days ago when I met with my
[SPEAKER_07]: friend Camille with Stephen DeFino.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who else was there?
[SPEAKER_07]: Kabuki J.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fox and my new friend, Matt.
[SPEAKER_07]: We all gathered at the Canna Canyon on
1507 Colorado Boulevard.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Boulevard 1507 Colorado in
Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a great place.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to time warp.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to put on some music and we are
going to journey back in time and when we
[SPEAKER_07]: get back, we will be at the Canna Canyon.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are here at the Canna Canyon in
Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Camille, will you remind me the address,
please?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm high as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1507 West Colorado Avenue.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_07]: So come down to 1507 West Colorado Avenue.
[SPEAKER_07]: Check out the Canna Canyon.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a great place.
[SPEAKER_07]: The couches are comfy.
[SPEAKER_07]: The tables are covered in rigs and they've
got an email.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come hit it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So guys, welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sitting a little further to my left is our
good friend Camille.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got such a great smile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good day.
[SPEAKER_07]: You look great today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sitting to my immediate left over here is
our good friend, Stephen DeFino.
[SPEAKER_07]: You are the president and founder of the
Veteran Farmers Alliance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_10]: That is correct.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for doing that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for being on the show.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_10]: Glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_07]: Over here to my kind of far to the right
is our buddy Kabuki J.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fox.
[SPEAKER_07]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, I'm awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for having me back.
[SPEAKER_07]: You are awesome as shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hashtag RunCBD.
[SPEAKER_07]: All day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hashtag Terps4Tots.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make that a shirt.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sitting to my right, is kind of a new
friend.
[SPEAKER_07]: Remind me your name, my friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: Matthew Cale.
[SPEAKER_07]: Matthew Cale.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm with an outfit here, Veterans for
Natural Rights.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm one of the individuals that helps out
with the event the other night at the DAB
[SPEAKER_06]: lounge.
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you for doing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for doing that.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to talk a lot about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Before we get to that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So thanks for joining me, everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: Before we get to the end, let me put a
disclaimer out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Camille is working at the Cannon Canyon.
[SPEAKER_07]: She is the host.
[SPEAKER_07]: And are you the owner here?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am co-owner.
[SPEAKER_07]: So she may have to stand up and take off
and go for a run any given moment here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So excuse her if that happens.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll try to get some of her stuff covered
in the beginning of the show here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So one thing I want to talk about with
everybody, the Cannabis Cup for Colorado
[SPEAKER_07]: has officially been canceled.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we were all stoked about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure everybody here had an idea of
something they wanted to do for 420 and
[SPEAKER_07]: for the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the flip side, I will say I am fairly
excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that this is going to be kind of
the turn of 420 being about private
[SPEAKER_00]: events.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the Secret Sesh is happening up in
Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be awesome.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're planning on doing something as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't talk too much about what we're
planning on doing, but I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is kind of a new wave of a
different 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to be cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the way that you put that because
that kind of works me into part of what I
[SPEAKER_07]: wanted to talk about, the importance of
consumption clubs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Since they're not going to let us have
large events like that, we need to have
[SPEAKER_07]: places like the Canna Canyon to consume
our cannabis for people to come and
[SPEAKER_07]: socialize.
[SPEAKER_07]: All we're doing is hanging out and
consuming cannabis and being friends here.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: We definitely need something like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: So before I get to that, let's talk about
the Veteran Farmers Alliance event that
[SPEAKER_07]: happened a couple of days ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to give you a huge shout out,
Stephen.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a huge event.
[SPEAKER_07]: How many people do you think showed up?
[SPEAKER_09]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd say, what do you think, Matt?
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably a little over 200?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was a little more than that,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Over the course of the day.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, easy 300.
[SPEAKER_11]: 10 to 7, and we were there from like,
we didn't leave until like 11 or 10 that
[SPEAKER_11]: night.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Stephen hosted an event at the Dab
Lounge in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's another social smoke lounge.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to the Dab Lounge.
[SPEAKER_11]: And thank you, Dan, for letting us host
that event there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a super nice event.
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to that, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Stephen hosted an event there called
the Veteran Farmers Alliance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that an official title, or was it just
the Veteran Farmers Alliance?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the Veteran Farmers Alliance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get together, party, smoke out,
sesh.
[SPEAKER_07]: VFA.
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a good time.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you tell us a little bit about the
Veteran Farmers Alliance?
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, the Veteran Farmers Alliance
brings the community together,
[SPEAKER_10]: brings veterans together with civilians,
brings breeders together, growers
[SPEAKER_10]: together, nutrient manufacturers,
and just glassblowers.
[SPEAKER_10]: It just takes everybody and brings them
all in one place and allows these guys to
[SPEAKER_10]: have free genetics, free information,
education, all that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're able to get it in one
centralized location to where they can
[SPEAKER_10]: have good medicine and get the best
medicine that's out there.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not this watered down crap.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, these are fresh genetics, good
genetics, and these guys care.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we had 300 people came through this
event inside of the Dab Lounge.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had breeders set up with their booths.
[SPEAKER_07]: They had seeds available.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had nutrient companies.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had glass companies.
[SPEAKER_07]: And all of these companies threw down
stacks of merchandise for the veterans.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I ask about what the value of the
prizes you gave away was that day without
[SPEAKER_07]: being rude?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the total value was just a little
over $12,000.
[SPEAKER_07]: $12,000 worth of products given to
veterans to help them grow better
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis, to fight their PTSD,
their pain, their depression, their
[SPEAKER_07]: anxiety, their anxiety,
[SPEAKER_07]: their anxiety, and their anxiety.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of things went down.
[SPEAKER_07]: I live in another city I was trying to
keep up what I understand is they have put
[SPEAKER_07]: a moratorium on more social clubs like
this and in eight years are all clubs like
[SPEAKER_07]: this forced to close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes Yes, so the moratorium was actually
set in place back in September six months
[SPEAKER_00]: the moratorium set so we are
Reapproaching, you know that six month
[SPEAKER_00]: mark of the moratorium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think they're just trying to
establish what they want to do with that
[SPEAKER_00]: and What they decided was they wanted to
ban them originally supposed to be for
[SPEAKER_00]: five years But they extended it to eight
years Kind of a blow but at the same time
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what the voters wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very passionate about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we believe in and That's what
we're gonna fight for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this isn't the end.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just the beginning The way that
it's written does that mean that in eight
[SPEAKER_00]: years you have to close Yes in eight years
by March 2024.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will have to close our doors.
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't there a second vote?
[SPEAKER_11]: Coming to right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's another vote on March 22nd the
second round of votes But you know a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: can happen in eight years marijuana can
become federally legal You know the
[SPEAKER_07]: opposite direction as well
[SPEAKER_06]: It gives us a little bit of time to get a
ballot referendum to allow these kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: clubs and it gives us a little bit of time
to force legislation on the issue because
[SPEAKER_06]: Jonathan Singer himself and also the
representative Kit Roop from Colorado
[SPEAKER_06]: Springs himself.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's backing a bill to legalize these
types of clubs statewide so These are
[SPEAKER_06]: already we already know that there is a
lot of support here in Colorado Springs
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise kit root wouldn't be on board.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think another thing that really spoke
volumes about that as well was the Amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of people that showed up for that initial
meeting on like February 22nd 24th I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: a standing room only and I think I think
there was only like two people out of like
[SPEAKER_00]: 120 plus that were against these clubs and
the majority of those people there were
[SPEAKER_00]: very much so for them about them and So
that was very frustrating, but the
[SPEAKER_07]: community has spoken so I Saw the meat I
watched part of the meeting on the
[SPEAKER_07]: internet the other day and the place was
packed once again We got to see our friend
[SPEAKER_07]: from the lazy lion the ears off the city.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah Remind me that guy's name Andrew.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I like very well spoken words there
way to put that one out there Yeah,
[SPEAKER_07]: someone's got to do it and I'm glad that
he chose to and he's a veteran also So
[SPEAKER_07]: shout out to the veterans.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's cool that he came and
supported supported the community vast
[SPEAKER_07]: majority of people there were veterans How
about the two city council members was it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Stephen grab the mic
[SPEAKER_10]: So I asked and I asked I asked the city
council members I said how many of your
[SPEAKER_10]: veterans I said just by showing hands show
me No, not one of them raise their hands.
[SPEAKER_10]: They wouldn't acknowledge that they were
veterans.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's disrespectful.
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's disrespectful to their service I'm
sure that when they go other places they
[SPEAKER_07]: get a veteran's discount.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, of course Yeah, well they wait raise
their hand then yeah You know,
[SPEAKER_10]: they didn't raise their hands so I asked I
turned around I said how many veterans are
[SPEAKER_10]: behind me and like three-quarters of the
room Raise their hands veterans marijuana
[SPEAKER_10]: patients, you know, they these guys don't
understand the this is a cry for help and
[SPEAKER_10]: All those guys that raise their hands all
those guys and girls.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have to say that They raised their
hands and it's like they didn't care They
[SPEAKER_10]: don't care.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was an emotional cry for help to there
were people breaking down on the stand
[SPEAKER_06]: Talking about the importance of these
clubs and the importance of these
[SPEAKER_06]: gathering places because they can't go
anywhere else They have lease agreements
[SPEAKER_06]: that prevent them from smoking in their
own homes These are people who serve their
[SPEAKER_06]: country and they're not allowed to take
part in the freedoms that they're
[SPEAKER_06]: guaranteed by the Constitution of the
state they live in It's a travesty we
[SPEAKER_07]: could almost just in the show right there
That was that's yeah, that's exactly
[SPEAKER_07]: what's going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk a little bit about the
importance of these clubs You got
[SPEAKER_07]: something to say go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was just gonna say and not to
mention shout out To the dab launch for
[SPEAKER_00]: providing an awesome space for those
veterans to have the Veterans Farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: Alliance event I mean if it wasn't for
these social clubs that community wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to Be brought together as easily
so I gave veterans dabs for their first
[SPEAKER_11]: time That was a veterans event I met Four
sets of parents that had special needs
[SPEAKER_11]: children that were curious about cannabis
and curious about CBD and it's funny that
[SPEAKER_11]: places like this bring all sorts of
patients throughout the spectrum together
[SPEAKER_11]: in some way or another and we help each
other even if it's just lending an ear and
[SPEAKER_11]: understanding or being available and being
you know introduced to someone and
[SPEAKER_11]: networking with someone that can help us
these clubs are absolutely essential to
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyone who really is seeking a healthy
social outlet in our community to not only
[SPEAKER_11]: Discuss cannabis but why it works for them
and you know, I really can't see anything
[SPEAKER_11]: healthier You know, it saddens me to see
it go the way that it has and you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm happy to help fight it in any way
possible because
[SPEAKER_00]: Working here also, I mean we see all types
of members as well and one thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: really Kind of stands out to me as amount
of questions that people have that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: scared to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, whether it's about CBD or THC or the
benefits
[SPEAKER_07]: We were having a conversation as friends
at the front counter just a few minutes
[SPEAKER_07]: ago to smoke and dabs talking about
growing and the folks behind us were
[SPEAKER_07]: learning everything we were saying Yeah,
we're absorbing that as one of that one of
[SPEAKER_07]: those people in that group was learning
from us on accident education and support
[SPEAKER_07]: they get just from showing up here is
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we can go to a bar and drink alcohol
until we die.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can physically drink enough alcohol at
the bar There's one bottle if you drink
[SPEAKER_07]: that whole bottle of whatever you choose
it will kill you You can come here and no
[SPEAKER_07]: one's going to let you smoke enough
cannabis to hurt yourself And I don't
[SPEAKER_07]: think you can smoke enough cannabis to
hurt yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will say you could probably get high I
do some dumb shit I can argue that but
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah, I mean no one's gonna let anybody
that's that high leave here We all have
[SPEAKER_07]: each other's backs.
[SPEAKER_07]: We look out for each other I've never seen
anybody get in our this is that's what's
[SPEAKER_06]: different about bars and these consumption
clubs I think that that's one of the
[SPEAKER_06]: points that I brought up in the the
testimony the other day was You know,
[SPEAKER_06]: we may have had what 300 combat veterans
packed into a club We could not have done
[SPEAKER_06]: that in an establishment serving alcohol
and a peaceful night.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would not have happened Yeah,
it was packed I have I have a pass with
[SPEAKER_07]: alcohol and we don't Get along very well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if it were at a place that served
alcohol, there's way less likely of a
[SPEAKER_06]: chance that I would have gone Yeah,
and a lot of these guys it's the same way,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know these these veterans especially,
you know They they've self medicated with
[SPEAKER_06]: alcohol before in their lives.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've self medicated with pills.
[SPEAKER_06]: All these things are harmful to them They
they hurt them.
[SPEAKER_06]: They hurt them their their families.
[SPEAKER_06]: They hurt their their friends But but this
it doesn't it brings them back into
[SPEAKER_06]: society it brings them back into this
community That we can sit there and help
[SPEAKER_06]: each other and take care of one another
like we should My friend glad we got to
[SPEAKER_07]: become friends and hang out This guy's

[SPEAKER_10]: I mean that was crazy That was the first
event I've ever done and I mean it went

veteran that Was upset the way it was
[SPEAKER_10]: going down and I had him come back and I
talked to him and you know He brought up a
[SPEAKER_10]: good point on some things and so I hooked
him up with a case Nutrients and was it

and that's the thing man, like my my
[SPEAKER_10]: organization I don't charge any membership
fees to these veterans.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's free They've already paid enough
these guys shouldn't have to pay a penny
[SPEAKER_07]: out of their pocket So if somebody's a
veteran in the Colorado Springs area a
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis user and needs some help How can
they get in touch with you?

Alliance We'll take good care of you.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll invite you to our next event.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can hang out the next event.
[SPEAKER_07]: I said our
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, here's another thing the veteran
farmers Alliance just doesn't stop there,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know It takes organizations that are
out there and brings them all together in
[SPEAKER_10]: one place So veterans have an access to
you know to care they they can reach out
[SPEAKER_10]: to each organization that has these
specialties and use that You know,
[SPEAKER_10]: whatever pertains to them whatever matches
up with that organization in them They use
[SPEAKER_10]: that and then once they're done then come
see the other organization They can use
[SPEAKER_10]: all now they have this central network hub
of actual, you know, they can go to
[SPEAKER_10]: outreach functions They can go to
different events.
[SPEAKER_10]: They can go hiking they go fishing and
that's that's bringing these organizations
[SPEAKER_10]: This is you know, this is alternate
therapy, you know is just another way of
[SPEAKER_10]: helping these guys heal and Being able to
offer them that that's like nobody's ever
[SPEAKER_10]: been able to do that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody wants to make things a
competition Yeah, we're trying to save
[SPEAKER_10]: lives.
[SPEAKER_10]: We just need to all come together and stop
the BS Yes, and just say hey, we're gonna
[SPEAKER_10]: take care of these guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't take care of them, but you can you
take them when you're done with them I'll
[SPEAKER_10]: take care of them when I'm done with them
you go to that next organization.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's no competition We're here to save
lives.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's drop this piddly bullshit and let's
start doing what we need to do veterans
[SPEAKER_10]: unite And the community that's the most
important people need to see that the
[SPEAKER_10]: community and veterans can you know come
together and they can integrate together
[SPEAKER_10]: and they can Socialize and there's no
drama, you know, you can't do that in a
[SPEAKER_10]: bar Somebody says the wrong thing,
you know, somebody's drunk.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll fuck PTSD or this or that Oh,
man, you gotta you're somebody's gonna get
[SPEAKER_10]: something in the face Yeah, you know and
but you go to a cannabis club and people
[SPEAKER_10]: are able to sit back relax get some
education, you know throw some knowledge
[SPEAKER_10]: to these guys and and and maybe Show these
guys what's really up with with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean some people going there.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're scared.
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't know what's going on,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of the clubs in town offer
free entry for veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that we do the lazy lion Does the
dab lounge?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's veterans that are out there
that are maybe Intimidated or nervous.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very accepting very Welcoming to
definitely veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: We definitely appreciate all of your
service.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is another thing you mentioned PTSD
in the end, you know veterans are the
[SPEAKER_06]: public face of it right now, but they are
we know that we are really a tiny portion
[SPEAKER_06]: of the people in society that actually
have PTSD the vast majority are actually
[SPEAKER_06]: women and We may be fighting a fight for
our rights right now with PTSD But we know
[SPEAKER_06]: that we're still fighting for the people
who are way too hurt too scared too angry
[SPEAKER_06]: too ashamed too afraid Locked up in their
home somewhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're fighting for them to in order for
their rights to be recognized as well as
[SPEAKER_07]: ours Absolutely, if you guys are
intimidated to come to a social smoke
[SPEAKER_07]: lounge The Kana Canyon has classy leather
couches.

[SPEAKER_07]: It's real.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go with it conversating here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, let's get it together.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're dictionary Hashtag classy as fuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like this place.
[SPEAKER_07]: So don't be shy come hang out I don't feel

[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we get their bottles of water on the
shelf over here You'll be well taken care
[SPEAKER_07]: of don't be afraid and other than that
There's no legal place for people to
[SPEAKER_07]: congregate and consume So if you want to
go somewhere and smoke Other than hanging
[SPEAKER_07]: out in the car behind some building or
something or being out somewhere in
[SPEAKER_11]: public, which we're technically legally
not allowed to do and you know to be
[SPEAKER_11]: respectful of Others, you know,
I don't feel the need for others to smell
[SPEAKER_11]: my medicine and that's just me being
considerate But I also as a patient and as
[SPEAKER_11]: someone who's over the age of 21
recreationally don't have a lot of safe
[SPEAKER_11]: places to go, you know, and not everyone
Works in the industry or has made their
[SPEAKER_11]: lifestyle around everything that we do so
in those moments where a patient or a
[SPEAKER_11]: normal record or occasional recreational
user might want A safe place to enjoy
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: What are we gonna do if these places
aren't around?
[SPEAKER_07]: Gotta go do something shady.
[SPEAKER_06]: The fact is is that if they pass laws
banning these types of establishments
[SPEAKER_06]: They're gonna push people out into their
public spaces and who wants to smell weed
[SPEAKER_06]: wherever they go Yeah, nobody wants to
smell weed wherever they go
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a large majority of people out
there who probably aren't gonna want to
[SPEAKER_06]: smell weed in the public parks Why do you
give people bars so they won't sit on a
[SPEAKER_06]: public park bench?
[SPEAKER_07]: Somewhere such a great point.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a cannabis consumer.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a breeder I'm all about the cannabis
life, but I do have a daughter that I
[SPEAKER_07]: don't hide her from cannabis It'll hide
cannabis from her.
[SPEAKER_07]: She knows what cannabis is.
[SPEAKER_07]: She is not attracted to the smell Of it at
all But I don't think that anybody should
[SPEAKER_07]: have to be at the park with their child
and explain what those guys over there are
[SPEAKER_07]: doing But I have to talk with my daughter
about that today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it shouldn't be anybody's fault.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_07]: I should decide when that conversation
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, keep that in mind you guys don't go
dabbing at the park.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, those guys I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a daughter.
[SPEAKER_10]: I very much feel the same way,
you know Right, you know, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was in city council me and I looked up I
was like how many liquor stores are there
[SPEAKER_10]: in Colorado Springs 104 I said how many
Bars are there?
[SPEAKER_10]: 188 Wow, but 15 cannabis clubs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh everybody loses their shit Guys it's
kind of like when they did the whole
[SPEAKER_10]: caregiver act It's like it's like it's not
even 1% of the people that grow in
[SPEAKER_10]: Colorado or caregivers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did they sneak something in at that city
council?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so huge problem with that in the
fact that the I have a large concentration
[SPEAKER_11]: of pediatric patients here that they're
not even Epileptic for the most part.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're cancer patients.
[SPEAKER_11]: They supply on it.
[SPEAKER_11]: They rely on a heavy supply of you know,
THC heavy material and 12 plants Sometimes
[SPEAKER_11]: doesn't even Cut 60 days of medicine for
them depending on what they're working
[SPEAKER_11]: with.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, most of these guys are you know,
they're not Commercial growers.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not you know, they're modestly
growing organically and getting you know
[SPEAKER_11]: decent yields, but These parents can do a
lot better with some, you know with more
[SPEAKER_11]: decent numbers, but restricting it to 12 I
feel is just It's gonna cause caregivers a
[SPEAKER_11]: lot more headaches It's gonna cause
parents who are trying to grow themselves
[SPEAKER_11]: because they can't go To dispensaries to
get what they need because they might not
[SPEAKER_11]: have it or whatever the case is I just
feel that it's unfair and very Just yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just about to say it seems like time
and time again It kind of feels like we're
[SPEAKER_00]: not getting what we voted for.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, absolutely It's I feel like they're
pushing the medical market away and
[SPEAKER_07]: forcing everybody to go shop at the
dispensary They want some of the
[SPEAKER_07]: caregivers and they want all of the tax
money.
[SPEAKER_06]: They do they were the dispensaries They're
actively pushing for that and there are
[SPEAKER_06]: senators who are trying to take away home
grow as we speak this this year actually I
[SPEAKER_06]: saw some language off of I'm gonna go
ahead and call her out Senator Conti her
[SPEAKER_06]: desk that wanted to limit all caregivers
and patients in the state to six plants
[SPEAKER_06]: maximum and This would not only affect
Individuals, but it would affect
[SPEAKER_06]: structures so that an apartment complex
complex would have a maximum of six plants
[SPEAKER_07]: in that apartment and I lived in the same
apartment building Exactly you're then
[SPEAKER_06]: committing a felony.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's so I you know, thankfully we
managed to get that that language removed
[SPEAKER_06]: from that bill but There are a lot of
issues like this that are coming up
[SPEAKER_06]: They're coming from from the industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're they're being actively lobbied for
by recreational and and some medical
[SPEAKER_06]: facilities to ones that are joint medical
rec, but they're trying to eliminate
[SPEAKER_06]: medical rights and Push everybody into the
recreational market and a lot of those
[SPEAKER_07]: dispensary owners have issues with clubs
like this Because they think that it's
[SPEAKER_07]: going to ruin their business as it yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: No Not that we've noticed it's still
growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah Our shop is still open this place is
still open and every one of the business
[SPEAKER_11]: owners that I know they are all happy for
Wanting regulation.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're all for licensing none of these
people that I know That run these clubs
[SPEAKER_11]: have an altar Motive to take money from
any establishment but to provide a service
[SPEAKER_11]: for people That is genuinely needed and
that's my honest two cents.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't work for any of these clubs.
[SPEAKER_11]: I You know visit them From time to time
and that's just honestly how I feel here
[SPEAKER_07]: every time I'm here Every time I show up,
I don't mention I'm coming and you're
[SPEAKER_07]: here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: What can I say?
[SPEAKER_07]: I did and I forgot There's some black
cherry Kim live resin on the table,
[SPEAKER_06]: which by the way tastes fantastic Thank
you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's tasty.
[SPEAKER_07]: I bread it we grew it over at the green
and healthy garden and then our friends at
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm very upset over this.
[SPEAKER_10]: I am basically allergic to every single
prescription pill out there The one I'm
[SPEAKER_07]: not allergic to a lot of listeners might
not be familiar We tell us a little bit
[SPEAKER_07]: about your injury.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so on April 11th of 2008 I was doing
route clearance as a combat engineer In
[SPEAKER_10]: solder City and I was hit more specific
with solder City.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's in Iraq.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, a lot of our listeners will write
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, sorry We were ambushed and the fifth
ID that went off blew a 13-inch hole into
[SPEAKER_10]: my vehicle and blew a five-inch hole into
my back causing my my hip to be shattered
[SPEAKER_10]: my Pelvis to be broken and my spine to be
shifted forward Causing me to have a
[SPEAKER_10]: little bit of spinal injury had over 200
pieces shrapnel in me and Took about three
[SPEAKER_10]: and a half months for the wound to close
up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very lucky to be a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely Thanks for pulling through at
me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm very happy to be here Thanks And for
the listeners it looks like if you Took a
[SPEAKER_07]: normal dudes back and it excuse me.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you're good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can I I'm a big dude I could put my
fist in the hole.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's exactly how I described To fill the
hole with putty would take your fist.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah All right, but you know the whole 12
plant count thing like I mean I consume so
[SPEAKER_10]: much I ingest I Smoke I dab I use topicals
You know for them to cut me down to 12
[SPEAKER_10]: when I have a 65 plant count Is asinine
it's it's just with they're not doctors.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no way for them to judge Who needs
what?
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean the standard whatever.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not medical doctors I spent three
hours with my medical doctor going over my
[SPEAKER_10]: plant program failure rates pesticide
rates clone failure rates You know
[SPEAKER_10]: Successful harvest, you know Like fan
failures light failures and you know you
[SPEAKER_10]: go over that and then we're like,
okay, we have finished product This is
[SPEAKER_10]: what's usable.
[SPEAKER_10]: This was isn't usable and then for City
Council to have No training in the medical
[SPEAKER_10]: field to to not even understand What a
plant count means to somebody to not even
[SPEAKER_10]: understand what you know, what level of a
grower?
[SPEAKER_10]: They're at you know, it's just it's
unforgivable.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just an insult and I'm not gonna buy
because I paid for that extended plant
[SPEAKER_10]: count I have proven every right why I need
that plant count and they are not gonna
[SPEAKER_10]: take it should stand up in court.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, absolutely You're gonna file a lawsuit
against the city of Colorado Springs
[SPEAKER_10]: lawyer come to court with you Because I
have over 6,000 pages of medical documents
[SPEAKER_10]: that can prove to them that in every
single manner they are wrong You've got
[SPEAKER_07]: better SOPs than some dispensaries I've
gone to Your notation and note-taking and
[SPEAKER_07]: your your planning is better than some
major grows in this state, bro I just well
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate it man.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just I take this seriously.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is my medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: This keeps me alive Can people follow you
on Instagram?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to give out absolutely?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes My my Instagram name is triceratops.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got some great pictures a grateful
dog.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that fans on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got a hell of a great grow.
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely one of my favorites Well,
thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you Well, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I would not have met these guys if
it weren't for a club, so I'm very
[SPEAKER_10]: grateful I mean, there's nothing crazy
going on.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody's slamming in the walls.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody's arguing or fighting I've got a
question for Camille, but she just took a
[SPEAKER_07]: big old dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm gonna give her half a second you
good All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you ever had anybody act up or try to
fight in there fights?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah No, so the craziest thing that
happened was um, we like to keep a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: atmosphere for our members.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Occasionally we'll have a member come
in who is intoxicated and in that moment
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we try and scooch him out as
fast as possible But occasionally they
[SPEAKER_00]: will get into the main lounge just by
people exiting So there's been one
[SPEAKER_00]: instance where we had to escort someone
off the the premises but It was fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went they went Kind of willingly so
that helped and and they were drunk too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So No, we just had to deal with a couple
drunk people that completely proved my
[SPEAKER_07]: point The only problems at the cannabis
social lounge or the drunk people that
[SPEAKER_00]: showed up the thing that I can really
appreciate too is more than once we've had
[SPEAKER_00]: members kind of bring something that
someone has left up to the counter kabuki
[SPEAKER_06]: is I left my wallet on the counter here
earlier and it was promptly returned to
[SPEAKER_06]: me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Another yeah, you call members
members member who shouted whose wallet?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a place where people look out for
each other
[SPEAKER_07]: City council meeting they said it that it
wasn't safe, but these are safe What's
[SPEAKER_00]: really frustrating is um, all of it Matt
was talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've been working on this this
license for the clubs and They're there
[SPEAKER_00]: Came out and said nothing is made in a
vacuum and that's very true and what's
[SPEAKER_00]: frustrating Is it feels like City Council
does not have that mentality at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't seem to grasp or understand a
few different sides whether it be veterans
[SPEAKER_00]: People who consume on a recreational level
or even just business owners They just
[SPEAKER_00]: don't seem to want to listen to what we
have to say But yeah kid repay and
[SPEAKER_00]: Jonathan singer are doing some really
awesome progressive stuff with the
[SPEAKER_00]: licensing and Trying to make these clubs
Here to stay which I can appreciate but
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado Springs whole nother story,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we have the same issues in Pueblo It
feels like our City Council hears us and
[SPEAKER_07]: we're like we want social clubs and they
turn around they talk to each other and
[SPEAKER_07]: they go guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Crazy how that happens to they just like
yeah have these conversations right in
[SPEAKER_07]: front of you and it's insane Aren't they
there to represent us aren't we supposed
[SPEAKER_07]: to be telling them?
[SPEAKER_07]: What they want they provide it and then
200 people show up and they say we want
[SPEAKER_07]: this and two people say no And the whole
City Council can say yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, no I did That you were saying it's
just stacked Yeah It's incredibly
[SPEAKER_11]: upsetting to me.
[SPEAKER_11]: So sorry if I'm for a lack of words at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, that is infuriating to see that
and It's like four people come up weight
[SPEAKER_10]: is bad and they're spitting out facts that
you could go on the internet and it's
[SPEAKER_10]: like, yeah, that's been There any shit off
a piece of paper not looking anyone in the
[SPEAKER_10]: eye then walking out of the room And it's
in its stack because they had the people
[SPEAKER_10]: that were for against all go up first.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not like, you know normal sessions
Everybody's allowed to voice their opinion
[SPEAKER_10]: whether for against equally at the same
time that way you can hear both sides No,
[SPEAKER_10]: it's they said their thing and they got to
leave because they're like, yeah We're not
[SPEAKER_10]: gonna make these old people stay and
that's who it was the people that were
[SPEAKER_10]: completely We're over 60 and you know
what?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not cool and you made a very bad
point Exactly and a lot of people that
[SPEAKER_11]: were making these complaints were more
about the opposition of what happened
[SPEAKER_11]: after we voted in amendment 64 then about
the clubs themselves and I feel like that
[SPEAKER_11]: distinction was completely lost in
translation if yeah, most of them like
[SPEAKER_06]: they would say things like my I live next
door to an apartment complex and The
[SPEAKER_06]: people there they smoke they smoke
marijuana's and They they they grow the
[SPEAKER_06]: marijuana's and they vent it right out
into the open and it stinks So it's like
[SPEAKER_06]: they had nothing to do with the actual
consumption clubs whatsoever It was just
[SPEAKER_06]: they were complaining about the the
ancillary effects of amendment 64 They're
[SPEAKER_06]: just stuck in the mud and if they have a
problem with it Then they should take it
[SPEAKER_06]: up with the voters who actually voted
amendment 64 into our state constitution
[SPEAKER_07]: Constitution right now instead of stepping
up now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I love a lot of people call it
marijuana's Yeah, marijuana's marijuana's
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we know so much about it them Cbd
I don't like it when people pluralize CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a glass of waters.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah
[SPEAKER_07]: We won't even get on the left lane drivers
anymore So these clubs are important you
[SPEAKER_07]: guys we need to do everything we can to
absolutely council to Well, what can we do
[SPEAKER_07]: for the next eight years?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there anything we can do to sway them
on that one?
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is that a permanent thing here in
Springs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so right now what I can say is that
there are petitions at a lot of the clubs
[SPEAKER_00]: here in town to kind of What's the word
recall the Band so you can get out there
[SPEAKER_00]: you can put your name on the list No,
let your city know that this is not
[SPEAKER_00]: something you're down for and that's what
we can do initially There's an online
[SPEAKER_07]: petition as well Stephen says Stephen and
Camille are politely sharing a mic.
[SPEAKER_07]: So sometimes Stephen gets cut off here I
was looking for the petition.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's searching in his phone Since I am not

[SPEAKER_07]: sign that petition?

Malaysia to do it on fiber.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's fine I'm not gonna argue with
you also in the kingdoms community after
[SPEAKER_10]: that whole city council thing went down a
lot of people are Talking about running
[SPEAKER_10]: for office now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah someone needs to kabuki Okay,
the problem with that is a lot Maybe in
[SPEAKER_11]: Pueblo, but here's the thing what's
happening The Springs right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we obviously need a voice We need a
voice on that council, but I think it also
[SPEAKER_11]: starts with maybe removing if these People
who are supposed to represent us won't
[SPEAKER_11]: listen then maybe they shouldn't be
representing us and that's what it comes
[SPEAKER_11]: down to their job is so maybe getting that
rotten apple out of the bunch and trying
[SPEAKER_11]: to Progressively put someone who will
voice all of our concerns and I mean Yeah,
[SPEAKER_11]: we we do need to find someone and I wish I
had the time but I know they're much more
[SPEAKER_11]: People out there much more qualified to do
something like that and I Would willingly
[SPEAKER_11]: back them a hundred percent That's box
tracks run CBD genetics and just me as a
[SPEAKER_11]: person as an advocate and I know Yeah,
sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_10]: Someone's gotta someone's gotta teach them
but there needs to be education These guys
[SPEAKER_10]: have no education.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're basing all of their decisions on
their emotions and you know 50 year old
[SPEAKER_10]: argument to them the most outdated medical
information Exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: And and what's happening is when you have
maybe seven people come up and say no and
[SPEAKER_10]: you have over 200 people willing to
testify that they want something You
[SPEAKER_10]: should be supporting the people that that
want it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean that's what the people want It's
just it's it's insane to me that you can
[SPEAKER_11]: not even just hear or Try to shelve it to
make 200 people.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean Was it less than 12 people that
came up against it?
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so less than a dozen people to like
200 people in a room That was about 30
[SPEAKER_06]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah testimony in five hours.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah Wow five hours of testimony and even
after all that, you know, you disrespect
[SPEAKER_10]: other veterans You don't even acknowledge
that you're a veteran and then you sit
[SPEAKER_10]: there and you may have these smart ass
looks like One of them nodding off.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah Andrew called them out.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm glad someone did because that would
have made me fierce I'd have thrown a shoe
[SPEAKER_10]: at that do you mean that's it's
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, you got guys Your only job is to
stay awake.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is your job.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, yeah, and they're all over 65 Most
of them are over 65, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: they're gonna be passing these little gyms
Let's pass it if you're over 50,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's time to leave office Isn't there the
right to redo the entire meeting since
[SPEAKER_07]: somebody fell asleep?
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a member not present for 88 they
they didn't even represent deaf people
[SPEAKER_10]: there.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know have a person that does sign
language there Who's good with the legal
[SPEAKER_07]: shit in Springs help us out here Maybe
that meeting can be totally redone since a
[SPEAKER_07]: city council member took a nap during the
meeting Maybe we need a redo on that whole
[SPEAKER_07]: thing Maybe since there wasn't something
there for deaf people so that they could
[SPEAKER_07]: hear and participate as well Maybe we need
a redo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we need to try that one over.
[SPEAKER_07]: We absolutely can't you guys?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm curious to see how this second vote
will go on.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the ones the date?
[SPEAKER_07]: Right March 22nd, okay, can the public
come to that one again?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're not gonna actually allow
public comment on that one stand outside
[SPEAKER_06]: and look like we can protest yeah protest
actually is our best bet right now is to
[SPEAKER_06]: Call like a massive amount of people and
show people how unhappy we are But I still
[SPEAKER_06]: don't think that that would actually sway
their vote But it would at least show them
[SPEAKER_06]: what they're doing is wrong and we are
starting to assemble.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly That we are active and that
we can we can actually change the face of
[SPEAKER_06]: politics in Colorado Springs and we can
get them on out of office I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead brother.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've seen it done in Denver, you know,
I've I've hacked up to the Capitol plenty
[SPEAKER_11]: times to Stop this shit for lack of better
words They've so many of those that
[SPEAKER_11]: they've tried to pass with children not
being able to medicate on school grounds
[SPEAKER_11]: them trying to CPS trying to say that Any
parent with a red card was, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: basically, you know Endangering their
child, you know if they had yeah,
[SPEAKER_11]: just a whole bunch of shit that we've had
to go through So I feel like in the
[SPEAKER_11]: Springs first of all educating people
about what's going on.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just like we did in Denver and bringing
making people aware of everything and then
[SPEAKER_11]: like I like Matt said Getting people
together to actually show that we can be
[SPEAKER_11]: the face Of change we do need that down
here.
[SPEAKER_11]: These clubs are essential limiting that
plant count is absolute bullshit I've been
[SPEAKER_11]: getting phone calls non-stop from these
parents that are freaking out about that
[SPEAKER_11]: and patients that are freaking out because
They're actively growing anywhere from you
[SPEAKER_11]: know, whatever, you know 24 to 36 to 60
plants, you know, whatever the case is
[SPEAKER_11]: pending on their needs Without a problem
without there ever being overages or
[SPEAKER_11]: stacks and sometimes they still come short
up for their medicine when it comes times
[SPEAKER_11]: to be processed even With that many plants
depending on what they grow and how they
[SPEAKER_11]: grow.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just think it's insane for an Olympic
city to talk about limiting What patients
[SPEAKER_11]: can't and cannot grow and how they it just
upsets me so much that that also wasn't
[SPEAKER_11]: talked about enough that wasn't You know,
yeah the focus on the club is equally
[SPEAKER_11]: important But I feel like they're sliding
one in with the other and that's horseshit
[SPEAKER_11]: and that needs to be addressed more and I
feel like within the Group of everyone
[SPEAKER_11]: that's for the clubs and and I don't think
enough people are aware about these plant
[SPEAKER_11]: counts If I if we bring both these groups
of people together that have this the same
[SPEAKER_11]: invested interest I think we'd have a
greater showing and that's just you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: my personal opinion So I'm more than happy
to reach out to the people that I know
[SPEAKER_11]: that are really coming at me and are
Distraught about them, you know cutting
[SPEAKER_11]: down the residential plant count and
obviously, you know We know all the
[SPEAKER_11]: veterans and all our friends and all our
colleagues that are in This business and
[SPEAKER_11]: are for these clubs that are doing amazing
things in the community.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get together This is the only way
we're gonna make a change is to put any
[SPEAKER_11]: little thing aside and come together So we
can actually show them the real numbers
[SPEAKER_11]: and the real phases of people that they're
affecting Should you think we'd be so bold
[SPEAKER_10]: to show them?
[SPEAKER_10]: Give them maybe a preview of what's gonna
happen if they ban these clubs on the 22nd
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's say we get a thousand people out
there by City Council and just smoke it
[SPEAKER_10]: up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's show them what happened
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean that might be what it takes to show
them.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean we want our clubs.
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't want to do this, but Maybe this
is an example we need to set where does
[SPEAKER_11]: that lead us and how okay?
[SPEAKER_11]: So and that was something us I don't know
if it was you or somebody else brought a
[SPEAKER_11]: point of about Manitou and then being in
the same El Paso County and then allowing
[SPEAKER_11]: recreational cannabis Do they have clubs
in Manitou or no?
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so I just don't understand how
you're going to allow these different
[SPEAKER_11]: assets You know these even with medical
but I think medical dispensaries we have a
[SPEAKER_11]: time down here in the Springs We have a
ton of places where medical and
[SPEAKER_11]: recreational patients can go and take me
taking care of And then where they go
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just the truth of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's that's why are you setting up your
oh the police chiefs?
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean just to not to jump on my note,
but he came in the room and basically This
[SPEAKER_11]: is this is not enforceable so And that
being said that's coming from the words of
[SPEAKER_11]: the police chief of our city Basically
telling us that there's really no way for
[SPEAKER_11]: them to be able to enforce this didn't you
say he put in 900 hours of man thousand
[SPEAKER_11]: hours 9,000 still unable to bring a single
college and whatever it was in our tax
[SPEAKER_07]: money like I'm just saying How many 9,000
hours divided by 40 our other cops for
[SPEAKER_07]: work week How many cops was that for how
much time holy crap?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah for one club citizens of
Colorado Springs you paid for that That
[SPEAKER_07]: was your money guys our money no charges
brought 9,000 hours at a cop's wage So
[SPEAKER_07]: that's what you guys paid for them to come
and hang out at one of these clubs with us
[SPEAKER_11]: try to mingle Yeah, and they still don't
understand.
[SPEAKER_07]: They probably came here and got stoned or
hung out had a great ass time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know Watch cartoons and eat pizza
But yeah, so that's also it creates a
[SPEAKER_11]: little confusion because you have the
council saying one thing Police chief is
[SPEAKER_07]: telling you another and citizens saying a
completely different thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and no one's being heard you have
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah And if the police isn't gonna enforce
it and the citizens obviously want it it's
[SPEAKER_11]: only a matter of time When that wall
breaks and we just keep pushing forward.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you go Well, I have a question
for Camille if now that they've done this
[SPEAKER_10]: they giving you eight years to recoup your
funds and there's no regulation Doesn't
[SPEAKER_10]: that reopen the black market?
[SPEAKER_00]: Encourages the Craigslist seller it
encourages deals going on behind in parks
[SPEAKER_00]: behind schools in parking lots That's what
that encourages now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have tourists Like I said jumping on
Craigslist looking for 420 weed marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: These are things that were brought up at
the meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah for the licensing with Kate repay and
Jonathan singer so They're just not
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking it through like at all,
huh?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all about the outside image even
though you can see through it It's all
[SPEAKER_07]: about what it brings to other cities or
other businesses that may want to come to
[SPEAKER_07]: this city It's a very military town.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of military influence here
and and church and church Yeah,
[SPEAKER_07]: both.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean our weird kind of area They
want to keep that image.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't want to look like Pueblo or
Denver.
[SPEAKER_07]: They want to have that clean military
Churchy feel yeah, unfortunately the data
[SPEAKER_06]: goes the other way after they legalized
marijuana Soldiers pissing hot actually
[SPEAKER_06]: went down So it went in the opposite
direction now that it's legal.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's no fun Yeah, they'll do their you
know, and that's how most veterans that I
[SPEAKER_11]: know even felt Being out of state out of
medical states is you know, they do their
[SPEAKER_11]: time or you know They serve their tour
whatever the case was and come back and
[SPEAKER_11]: Medicaid and be done with the whole thing
grow in their beard and be happy Yeah,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know why fuck it up while you're
working You know those if your employer
[SPEAKER_11]: says you can't then obviously that's the
rule of the game if that's how you're
[SPEAKER_11]: getting your money You know, if that's
what's paying for your school why
[SPEAKER_11]: jeopardize it, you know, I know more
people I think about it that way But at
[SPEAKER_11]: the same time That's also asking someone
not to medicate and that's a very hard
[SPEAKER_11]: choice that people have to make to make
all those decisions so, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: it's a Double-edged sword on that thought,
you know but to that thought of this place
[SPEAKER_11]: being a church heavy military town Dude,
I know more housewives and girls.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that consume cannabis, you know,
that's such a Closeted thing in this
[SPEAKER_11]: community.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it that show weeds?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah The the biggest growing demographic
of weed smokers is above 55 nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah people that are retired Relax elderly
people are flocking to Colorado in order
[SPEAKER_06]: to retire because they want to smoke weed
when they retire.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great I get a ton of tourists who
become members who are definitely older
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of want the experience ask
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like well, what does a gram look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is a dab?
[SPEAKER_00]: What what are people saying this thing
called Salvia or sativa?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: educating these people they really just
Want to experience it for the first time
[SPEAKER_07]: like that's awesome It's great to have
people like you here to invite those
[SPEAKER_07]: people Into the community and welcome and
show them how it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah with welcoming arms.
[SPEAKER_07]: I totally Yeah, most of those people are
profoundly grateful that these places
[SPEAKER_06]: exist, you know, they I mean and it showed
that the other night I mean a lot of them
[SPEAKER_07]: broke down into tears Otherwise,
you got people that just bought their
[SPEAKER_07]: first medicine or their first cannabis
their first dad they're in their car
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a documentary where the dudes
light in the bottom of the pipe I mean you
[SPEAKER_07]: go home and try that you don't know what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that's your brand new again I get the
glass hot and somebody here will
[SPEAKER_10]: definitely show you Going into a
dispensary and talking to some chick that
[SPEAKER_10]: has big tits and has no education on what
strain does water this or that she's just
[SPEAKER_11]: there Well, yeah falls up to management,
you know and they're right to that regard
[SPEAKER_11]: I will say I love the Springs that there
are a lot of places here that have good
[SPEAKER_10]: Educated bud tenders and I don't fall you
go into a club like this.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a different vibe more education Yeah,
absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's also another issue I mean if
you get you get a 21 year old kid,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know Would you rather him go to a bar?
[SPEAKER_06]: Where a bartender can sit there and
monitor him and then cut him off when he's
[SPEAKER_06]: had enough Or would you rather him go to a
liquor store and go home with a bottle of
[SPEAKER_06]: vodka and get himself?
[SPEAKER_06]: Stupid drunk and end up destroying
something or getting behind the wheel and
[SPEAKER_06]: destroying somebody.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah I'd rather him be at a cannabis club
not drinking if he were my son sitting on
[SPEAKER_07]: the couch intellectual conversation
listening to laid-back music The worst
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that's gonna happen is they might
fall asleep on the couch and you get a
[SPEAKER_11]: little yeah And I see people do that at
these clubs members might not offer
[SPEAKER_11]: whatever the case is None of these club
owners wake them up rudely to leave or you
[SPEAKER_11]: know It's not about a turnkey spot thing
and they rest there comfortably till
[SPEAKER_11]: they're comfortable enough to wake up and
you know They make sure they're okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're hydrated every club I've been to
has literally had that mentality and I
[SPEAKER_11]: point that out to people because people
don't know and they assume that it runs
[SPEAKER_07]: Like something that's not I like to take
huge dabs And sometimes when I take a
[SPEAKER_07]: giant dab here before I can blow it all
the way out Somebody's got a bottle of
[SPEAKER_07]: water in my face.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you're gonna need this bro You never
have to cough more than once or twice
[SPEAKER_07]: before someone's got water for you They're
free.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, if you're thirsty and need a
couch and a dab, it's a great spot The
[SPEAKER_07]: mixture of people is always great here,
too I got dreadlocks down to my butt and
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sitting next to a veteran.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I love it Definitely two dreads some
veterans a guy from Miami.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep our new friend over here.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is honestly I've done several
podcasts away from my home studio.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is my favorite that I've done on
another couch
[SPEAKER_07]: To the listeners when it comes time,
let's be proactive It's time if you're in
[SPEAKER_07]: Colorado and you do not have rules on
social clubs It's time for you or your
[SPEAKER_07]: nerdy friend that's involved in the
politics.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know who he is He's in every group
Mike that's you in Pueblo, bro Get you
[SPEAKER_07]: guys together and start making rules for
social smoke clubs in your city before
[SPEAKER_07]: they get bad Be proactive put that out
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know exactly the steps on how to
do that But one of your friends does knows
[SPEAKER_07]: how to create an initiative knows how to
get a petition started They know how to
[SPEAKER_07]: get it going and that's probably you in
your group, right Matt exactly veterans
[SPEAKER_06]: for natural rights basically exists to
push policy we defend all kinds of natural
[SPEAKER_06]: individual rights such as the right to
medicate yourself the way you please also
[SPEAKER_06]: veterans rights any other individual
rights That has to do with freedom and
[SPEAKER_06]: liberty the right to safe access medicine
safe access of medicine Is is the primary
[SPEAKER_06]: one that we lobby on here in Colorado?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it is such a big issue here.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a new industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's forming and It's the Wild West,
you know, there's there's no real
[SPEAKER_06]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's being crafted right now We're setting
policy and everyone's eyes are on us.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are the revolution.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes to be a part of it Thanks for us
standing up for it with us Well,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's I'm proud to do so.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you Thank you So now also if you are
in a state that has not gone legal with
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis yet Start if you're writing the
rules to create medical and or
[SPEAKER_07]: recreational cannabis in your state Be
sure to include these social clubs Make
[SPEAKER_07]: sure they can be open make sure that they
exist Make sure they're regulated in a
[SPEAKER_07]: fair way make it I recommend that you make
it to where these places have a grow Tour
[SPEAKER_07]: these social clubs have a grow attached to
them that can provide the product to this
[SPEAKER_10]: place would be ideal in my opinion Or at
least a private grower right that has like
[SPEAKER_10]: an overabundance and they want to Offload
their their extra they should be able to
[SPEAKER_10]: do that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean we should be able to Stimulate and
stabilize the economy in every shape and
[SPEAKER_10]: way and manner I mean it only makes sense
to do that and by blocking that we're just
[SPEAKER_10]: blocking You know really good medicine
that otherwise could be shared all over
[SPEAKER_07]: the city How many potholes did you guys
hit on the way over here?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh shit?
[SPEAKER_07]: Every six months in Colorado Springs
because of the potholes if we could kind
[SPEAKER_07]: of do proper things with the tax money
Yeah, generate proper tax revenue type
[SPEAKER_07]: places like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: We could fix some of the damn potholes
Last pothole could be filled with pot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, fill those potholes with pot money.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do it I want to give a shout out to
Rhode Island.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was told that in Rhode Island the
dispensaries are going to open without
[SPEAKER_07]: grows attached and the grows will be done
by guys like you and I that know how to
[SPEAKER_07]: grow and we can Take it to the
dispensaries and legally sell it to them
[SPEAKER_10]: You do three three sheets of paper you get
a test and then you can go in fact that
[SPEAKER_06]: that every last Grower the the top-notch
growers in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: They they're not at dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they're independent guys who are
running their own grows and they're
[SPEAKER_06]: growing the Best medicine in the entire
state in the entire country in the entire
[SPEAKER_11]: world All the best growers I know are
independent growers or breeders or outside
[SPEAKER_11]: working Yeah, that's and that's very rare
maybe you I guess like I'm Jeff you're the
[SPEAKER_07]: first I'm trying I have run a small grow
I've got a very small grow that I breed a
[SPEAKER_07]: lot and mostly I'm trying to bring that
quality to this large facility I'm running
[SPEAKER_07]: the green and healthy wellness grow now 85
flowering life I see why the quality falls
[SPEAKER_07]: off a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a lot of stuff to manage.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a new environment You can't just
throw up a 14,000 BTU air conditioner a
[SPEAKER_07]: couple of blowers a fan now go and You got
to put in tons of air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to have ducting for days There
are miles of PVC tubing in that grow I use
[SPEAKER_07]: One room uses a thousand gallons of water
a day If I mix one of those tanks off of
[SPEAKER_07]: it imagine the amounts of nutrients I'm
mixing there's One thousand seven hundred
[SPEAKER_07]: and fifty milliliters of one nutrient that
goes in there and I'm using Five or six
[SPEAKER_07]: different things if I mess one of those up
imagine the catastrophe Yeah, yeah,
[SPEAKER_07]: so they're trying to bring that level of
quality to that playing field.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a true challenge No, absolutely and a
lot of people don't take any of those
[SPEAKER_11]: things into account.
[SPEAKER_11]: We brought that up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah Yeah, that's definitely the I see why
the small boutique grows are preferred and
[SPEAKER_07]: beneficial It's hard to get this stuff
going on in a big facility like that I'll
[SPEAKER_07]: get it there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I promise I Can take probably 78% credit
for it in the first run at the new grow
[SPEAKER_07]: the ladies helped a lot Shout-out to
damsel and Haley.
[SPEAKER_07]: They did give me a lot of help John Hunt
is in there as often as he can and then I
[SPEAKER_07]: have a crew of a few dudes that come
Occasionally and do if I need things that
[SPEAKER_07]: I just can't handle by myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: They do de-leafing So I could take like
seventy five eighty percent credit for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool Runs a lot of the bedroom for
me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's nice, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's good to have an owner that's involved
Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great to have hunt there and involved
in helping me out But I touch every single
[SPEAKER_07]: plant every single course every single day
First one in last one out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's great man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Open and close the gate every day I love
what you do there man.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll keep supporting.

[SPEAKER_07]: She's a great chick You'd like to watch
her.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure she's fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's got tattoos and takes fat dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nothing wrong with that I'm gonna
kind of I'm gonna kind of sit back and
[SPEAKER_05]: take dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's got some dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's team dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Chris for putting in the
dreadlocks for us Mike looks a little
[SPEAKER_07]: offended.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm just wondering if you can be on
the team this early.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah Actually, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, the only reason you're right is cuz
see I wouldn't know I've had long hair
[SPEAKER_07]: before but I never would dread since she's
had to deal with some social stigma
[SPEAKER_07]: already She's been harassed by somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's official Not when they went in
I I only asked because I watched what
[SPEAKER_01]: happened when a dude got the dreadlocks
Worn for like two festivals and then cut
[SPEAKER_01]: them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched the community revolt around them
Just throw back to car I don't know where
[SPEAKER_01]: that came from that was that happened
years ago in college But yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I just seem like a good question to hit
you with Mike's comfortable on the show
[SPEAKER_07]: now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: We said he was comfortable on the mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like I'll say anything Right like I'm
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's something about this table.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm possibly something about dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's both.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's both Yes, yeah, I've already gotten
some serious I've already gotten some
[SPEAKER_05]: serious negativity about them some serious
hate.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm already gonna call myself team
dreadlock It's official.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's got a nice little starter kit you
guys All right, so I'm gonna kind of hand
[SPEAKER_07]: you the hosting situation here let you ask
Mike some questions I will definitely
[SPEAKER_07]: interject and drive the show But I'm gonna
sit back and take some dabs of some
[SPEAKER_07]: triangle killer from turpex while you guys
chat So listeners, let her know how she
[SPEAKER_07]: does send her some tweets and send her
something on Instagram or on snapchat Or
[SPEAKER_07]: make sure you follow her on periscope and
let her know what you thought of her
[SPEAKER_07]: performance here on the podcast All right,
it's all yours young lady.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool So this idea for this podcast
actually came from a trip coming over to
[SPEAKER_05]: Colorado while I was moving here in
December I spent most of the trip
[SPEAKER_05]: listening to the grow from your heart
podcast and I Thank you and tell us where
[SPEAKER_07]: you came from Florida, so you know from
Florida to Colorado and listen to the
[SPEAKER_05]: podcast Yeah, we actually went up to North
Carolina first and then came over to so
[SPEAKER_05]: like we had an extra long trip because it
was Christmas so We went to go see my
[SPEAKER_05]: family in North Carolina and then came
over so like I mean it was a nice break
[SPEAKER_05]: for a couple days But yeah, we definitely
got a lot of podcasts listening in that's
[SPEAKER_07]: a lot of podcast show us a lot of stats
moving for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you I think that's why scooby liked
you so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like I've heard this guy's voice
already
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, he really is but yeah,
so Chris and I weren't Bobo Blaster co and
[SPEAKER_05]: I were discussing about it the whole time
that you guys really needed to do a show
[SPEAKER_05]: about the upcoming election and that Pro
marijuana people need to know which
[SPEAKER_05]: candidate to vote for and which one will
actually help Marijuana laws get put in
[SPEAKER_05]: place instead of helping us or you know,
making us take steps backwards.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Yeah, so a lot of my questions Here
about the upcoming election So I guess my
[SPEAKER_05]: question to you Mike is um, what states
look like they'll be legalizing marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: in the upcoming election Okay,
it's a little too early to tell What the
[SPEAKER_01]: votes gonna look like come November,
but we already know that a number of
[SPEAKER_01]: states are gonna be voting on legalization
Or we've got a good list of states where
[SPEAKER_01]: there are major groups that look like
they've got a shot of getting it on the
[SPEAKER_01]: ballot and in November or we're states
where there's a Legislative effort to get
[SPEAKER_01]: it on the ballot in November In those
states or Arizona, California,
[SPEAKER_01]: Florida Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan,
Missouri, Nevada Rhode Island and Vermont
[SPEAKER_01]: May all be voting on recreational
marijuana this November.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay states voting on just medical
Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska,
[SPEAKER_01]: North Carolina and Ohio That's a shitload
of states voting this November other
[SPEAKER_01]: states could Make the list there's still
plenty of time in most states for either a
[SPEAKER_01]: ballot ballot initiative or for people to
lobby their legislatures Enough to get the
[SPEAKER_05]: vote on the ballot in November this year
Wow, that is a lot of states actually I
[SPEAKER_05]: wasn't expecting you to say that many
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I had to make notes for the
first time ever when I got emailed this
[SPEAKER_01]: list of questions Jeff was talking about a
minute ago That nerdy part of my brain got
[SPEAKER_01]: really excited and I was like this is the
show I've been wanting to do and somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: did the line You had a nice long list of
states there Fuck over because you had
[SPEAKER_01]: medical on one side and wreck on the other
to page or a front and a back side because
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got notes on each state's effort,
too I just don't know how in depth you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to go with this answer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean you can really give it to me That's
fine because I mean, you know the articles
[SPEAKER_05]: that I want to write I wanted to do one on
each state So if you want to go through
[SPEAKER_05]: the like just a brief thing on each state,
that's totally cool Well now I tried to
[SPEAKER_07]: avoid the subject, but you just said
something that I've got To address I'm
[SPEAKER_07]: gonna bust you out here.
[SPEAKER_07]: She said write articles Let our listeners
know where those articles are going to
[SPEAKER_05]: appear and who you represent Yeah,
so shout out to miss Mary Jane Coe because
[SPEAKER_05]: I am the new intern blog writer for them
and I have been helping them get their
[SPEAKER_05]: blog up and running and In production I've
been writing the articles and stuff for
[SPEAKER_05]: them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So shout out to miss Mary Jane Coe and
Madison and Dan I'm you know, so that's
[SPEAKER_05]: where the articles will be eventually And
you're an intern.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so you don't get paid That's right
that you're doing that for doing that
[SPEAKER_07]: it'll work on a nice resume.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely Thanks for supporting the
community for free.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so we all got to do our part you
guys Yeah, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll step back So we were at which states
are voting on legalization And I was just
[SPEAKER_01]: about to run through a brief little note
on each or at least a little note that I
[SPEAKER_01]: made Looking these up this afternoon This
list came out in December or January And
[SPEAKER_01]: already it's only March but there's
already been time for another state to
[SPEAKER_01]: make this list and I think possibly for
one to drop off of it but Back when this
[SPEAKER_01]: was this official list that I kind of
stashed was published Arizona folks,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a group collecting signatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need a hundred and fifty thousand
signatures by July 7th to make the 2016
[SPEAKER_01]: vote in November The initiative includes
homegrown so From what I could gather
[SPEAKER_01]: they're gonna have a Colorado style system
that includes homegrown Not all the states
[SPEAKER_01]: that are looking to vote on legalization
Have homegrown each state has its own
[SPEAKER_01]: initiative.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an issue its initiative comes with
its own rules We just saw Ohio vote on
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization and vote against it mainly
because of those special rules They would
[SPEAKER_01]: have had legalization that could have been
shopping and wheat stores But chose not to
[SPEAKER_01]: because of who was gonna profit the most
from the production into that industry So
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's written specifically for a bunch
of people in your state to make money,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's probably not gonna pass California
could go either way California never shies
[SPEAKER_01]: away from shooting itself in the foot here
they led the way with medical in 96 and
[SPEAKER_01]: that existing industry has often worked
Against legalization efforts There's a
[SPEAKER_01]: huge black market in California that also
works against the legalization efforts And
[SPEAKER_01]: then there's all the anti-pop people and
some of the major anti-marijuana groups in
[SPEAKER_01]: the country are based in California And
all of that doesn't bode well for either
[SPEAKER_01]: of the initiatives in California that are
being circulated for signatures right now
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the Sean Parker backed initiative
is already for sure on the ballot And I
[SPEAKER_01]: know that there's at least one other one
looking to be on the ballot competing with
[SPEAKER_01]: it In Florida two different groups are
collecting signatures right now one for
[SPEAKER_01]: medical marijuana one for full
legalization Both initiatives look really
[SPEAKER_01]: popular Get out and find signatures people
find a place to sign and make sure you
[SPEAKER_05]: vote November Yeah, we came really close
last year like stupidly close and you
[SPEAKER_05]: know, it's funny like I have friends In
Florida who would just complain about the
[SPEAKER_05]: fact that it didn't get legalized and I'd
be like, oh well Like who did you vote for
[SPEAKER_05]: and they'll be like I didn't vote like
what right what Europe you're upset Right,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you actually got to get out on
election day.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really not that hard If you think
your vote doesn't matter the only way your
[SPEAKER_07]: vote doesn't matter is if you don't vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely You're yeah, just fucking about
shout out to voting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so So that's Florida Maine Maine you
guys might be voting on legalization The
[SPEAKER_01]: article I brought found on Maine didn't
list whether it was legislative or a
[SPEAKER_01]: ballot initiative It kind of made it sound
like it was already on the ballot in 2016
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you live in Maine, you need to
Google it Massachusetts legislative
[SPEAKER_01]: efforts are underway for decriminalization
That would include legal possession.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would be legal to possess a certain
amount of marijuana But it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: decriminalization, which means it's still
sold from a black market No, no taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: No regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: No lab testing none of that and there's a
group in Massachusetts looking to put the
[SPEAKER_01]: full legalization on the ballot and
they're collecting signatures In Michigan,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a group collecting signatures For
full legalization including a 12 plant
[SPEAKER_01]: home grow which would be double here in
Colorado Michigan folks, I definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: Looked get out and find a place to sign
that petition Missouri one groups
[SPEAKER_01]: collecting signatures for a legalization
effort They look pretty good But it's
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna take people turning out to vote for
it in Nevada legalization will be on the
[SPEAKER_07]: ballot folks in Missouri started sorry to
jump in there I know those folks in
[SPEAKER_07]: Missouri.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Darrell and his wife Trish
Those are the folks running the movement
[SPEAKER_01]: out there with them a couple weeks ago
nice Rhode Island in Vermont both have
[SPEAKER_01]: legislative efforts for legalization
underway And then I didn't collect any
[SPEAKER_01]: detailed notes on the medical efforts I'm
surprised to see Mississippi on there And
[SPEAKER_01]: Ohio's still reeling from that major loss
last November.
[SPEAKER_01]: So It doesn't surprise me that they're
working on medical Instead of another full
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization effort Yeah, that's Those are
the ones that are for sure already have
[SPEAKER_01]: major legalization groups or legislative
efforts to legalize marijuana if you heard
[SPEAKER_01]: your state on the list you either need to
get out and sign that petition or Hop on
[SPEAKER_01]: Google real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look up who your elected representative is
for your area for your state legislature
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to give that person a call or
email them if you're shy at all or email
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super super simple Write them a
little letter and email dear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. So-and-so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm one of your voters I'd like you to
vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes on legalizing marijuana That's all you
have to say if you want to get in and
[SPEAKER_01]: start making the arguments for them and
helping them with that part of it too You
[SPEAKER_01]: can in your email.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to be windy Hi,
mr.
[SPEAKER_01]: So-and-so, please vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you That's all you need to write the
more people they hear that from the more
[SPEAKER_01]: likely they are to vote for you To vote
for what you're asking to vote for so take
[SPEAKER_01]: the time and do it If you're a state where
it's got you need signatures gathered to
[SPEAKER_01]: get it on the ballot If the state requires
a hundred thousand signatures collect
[SPEAKER_01]: three hundred thousand When you sign the
petition make sure that the petition
[SPEAKER_01]: signer knows that shit I see efforts fail
to make the ballot every year because they
[SPEAKER_01]: needed a hundred thousand They turn in
fifty a hundred and fifty thousand and
[SPEAKER_01]: then the state decertifies eighty thousand
and they're short That's happening in
[SPEAKER_01]: Maine right now And I think in Ohio as
well So when you're gathering signatures
[SPEAKER_01]: for marijuana, you need you need to gather
triple the signatures like it's incredibly
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult to get this stuff on the ballot
For a ballot initiative But it's doable if
[SPEAKER_01]: you do it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how Colorado did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how a number of the other legal and
medical states have done it Awesome,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so in this upcoming election,
which candidates does it look like?
[SPEAKER_05]: Will have the most positive influence on
the cannabis industry if they're elected
[SPEAKER_01]: into office by far Bernie by miles A
distant second would be Hillary who will
[SPEAKER_01]: probably continue the nonsense.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're dealing with now from Obama Most of
the Republican candidates are either
[SPEAKER_01]: indifferent Most are all of the candidates
at this point that had outright said that
[SPEAKER_01]: they would use their position as president
to come in and shut down what we're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: in Colorado and Washington and Oregon And
now Alaska They're off.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've dropped out of the race So that's
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gotten past that point in this
election That's a really good thing to
[SPEAKER_05]: know that at this point like none of the
candidates that are on there will try to
[SPEAKER_01]: shut it down Yeah, well, none of them have
pledged to so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Given the nature of politics in especially
this fucking here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's saying that it hasn't happened yet is
a really safe bet God only knows where the
[SPEAKER_01]: elections gonna go this year If you
thought politics were boring, you're not
[SPEAKER_07]: watching the right news shows I I don't
I'm I can't say that I can't out loud say
[SPEAKER_07]: that I endorse any specific candidate But
either but if you were going to vote only
[SPEAKER_07]: based on cannabis, you got to vote on burn
one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah That's definitely who you'd go for if
you're gonna vote just on cannabis laws
[SPEAKER_07]: That dude used to go to Grateful Dead
shows that dude protested at so many if if
[SPEAKER_01]: all those images I've seen they're totally
true They've they're checked by major
[SPEAKER_01]: media outlets, but here's the thing if you
want to vote for Bernie In November you
[SPEAKER_01]: need to vote for Bernie now Odds are your
state already had its primary caucus if it
[SPEAKER_01]: hasn't yet Your ass needs to get in front
of computer right now in Google what you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to do to participate in your caucus
The odds are you're already locked out
[SPEAKER_01]: because you didn't do this a month ago But
that's not true in like half of the
[SPEAKER_01]: upcoming states or more So if you want a
chance to vote for Bernie in November,
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to get out and vote For now It
just it has to happen for him to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: Democratic nomination It's gonna be a lot
of work and a lot of people turn it out
[SPEAKER_01]: who don't usually turn out and that's your
fan base In November, it's you got to get
[SPEAKER_01]: out now.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, and Most some states have
primary votes where you just go vote like
[SPEAKER_01]: you do in November Each state's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of the what you're googling to
see how to participate in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not Hard, it's not difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't be that big pain in the ass and
it'll have major repercussions in
[SPEAKER_01]: November.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get out and do it You can't bitch if
you don't vote.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you can't.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so We're talking about uh,
the candidates that are most pro cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we can all agree that it's mr.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bernie Sanders right there.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah So if Bernie gets elected into
office, what does that mean for legal weed
[SPEAKER_05]: like across the nation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, well his campaign pledged So far only
goes so far as to say he won't Interrupt
[SPEAKER_01]: the experiments going on in legal states
He's very set against the war on drugs,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he's talked about decriminal or
legalizing it federally On the record this
[SPEAKER_01]: campaign It's As a president he's got a
couple of different options he could take
[SPEAKER_01]: The president could sign an executive
order Which would legalize it federally
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of Executive orders aren't federal
law necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's a lot of Contentious politics
involved with executive orders,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the executive order isn't a change in
federal law That would still mean
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana is illegal federally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the president signed an order
saying who don't care What we really need
[SPEAKER_01]: to happen is an act of congress And where
the who's president?
[SPEAKER_01]: Matters there is because they get to a
bully pulpit is what they call it where
[SPEAKER_01]: the president gets to say hey guys in
congress It would be a really good idea if
[SPEAKER_01]: you worked on this And they do it all the
time with all kinds of different shit and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no reason they can't do it with
all right You guys we're gonna figure out
[SPEAKER_01]: how to legalize marijuana this year do
this this and this get on it And like he
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't get to tell him like what to do
like a your boss doesn't work,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's similar With obama they just kind
of look at Them and nod their heads and
[SPEAKER_01]: then half of the people elected to
Represent us have chose to do nothing for
[SPEAKER_01]: the last nine years and it's been a
fucking problem but Getting Bernie into
[SPEAKER_01]: the presidency and paying attention to
Senate races This year major shifts in
[SPEAKER_01]: politics could happen Over half of our
elected representatives in Washington DC
[SPEAKER_01]: right now are up for election if we fire
that many of them and replace them with
[SPEAKER_01]: quality candidates that are even Mildly
pro-cannabis 2016 teen could be a
[SPEAKER_07]: monumental year for legal marijuana I
Think the podcast just accidentally
[SPEAKER_07]: full-on endorsed Bernie Sanders.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah If you're a pro marijuana person,
that's the logical rational choice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, definitely So there's a lot of
mostly then there's dark Yeah,
[SPEAKER_07]: there are a lot of arguments to be made
after that but right that's what you're
[SPEAKER_07]: looking at a hundred percent is cannabis
then you That's where your money and vote
[SPEAKER_07]: would go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very much not a one-issue voter,
but marijuana legalization is very near
[SPEAKER_01]: and dear to my heart And I can see voting
in an election like this based purely on
[SPEAKER_07]: that Well, my life is 98.7% Funded by the
legalization of cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's only like 25% true for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like yeah, it's 0% true for me,
but I said still like a big aspect for why
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Voting to be honest, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's I've studied this for so long in just
having it prohibitive Prohibited Just that
[SPEAKER_01]: concept in our law has ruined so many
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's infected every part of American life
from Politics to medicine to how we
[SPEAKER_01]: interact with each other our neighbors the
police how they how the police interact
[SPEAKER_01]: with us It's it's just poisoned everything
it's touched and it's touched everything
[SPEAKER_01]: and it has To stop and it stops this
election year when people under 30 turn
[SPEAKER_05]: out and vote Which will hopefully happen a
lot more this year than it has in the past
[SPEAKER_07]: We've seen so many people turning out for
caucuses and voting pro Bernie in a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: places Yeah, we've been sending records
for caucus attendances attend caucus
[SPEAKER_07]: attendance Yeah, so it's there are gonna
be a lot of new voters out there this
[SPEAKER_07]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are there are more than usual
energized, but we've seen this before if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're a political Junkie they refer to it
as getting due caucus It's a guy who could
[SPEAKER_01]: have been president and everybody thought
he was gonna be and all the college kids
[SPEAKER_01]: were gonna vote for him and then he lost
in a fucking landslide to a nightmare of a
[SPEAKER_01]: Republican And it happens Bernie's really
really popular and he could he could lose
[SPEAKER_01]: in a landslide to the Republican nominee,
whoever that ends up being God don't let
[SPEAKER_01]: it be Trump and He could lose to Hillary
in the primaries And we could be voting
[SPEAKER_01]: Hillary versus somebody and then what that
means for legalization is very different
[SPEAKER_01]: Trump just is fucking crazy, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was gonna I was We're fucking living a
Mad Max movie inside four years I've
[SPEAKER_05]: already and I know everyone says this but
like I've already let it be very well
[SPEAKER_05]: known that I will probably leave the
United States I have family in England.
[SPEAKER_01]: I but you've got a lifeboat You got to get
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I might I might actually jump ship I
mean, I've always wanted to go backpacking
[SPEAKER_05]: and like do the Europe thing anyways,
so like thanks for helping me make that
[SPEAKER_05]: decision, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't know what I'm gonna do if
that dude gets elected Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna ride the boat till it crumbles.
[SPEAKER_07]: My life will change.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is an absolute thing Yeah,
absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess my next question actually goes
to both of you then so realistically is
[SPEAKER_05]: legalizing marijuana across the nation
Something we want to see I know for myself
[SPEAKER_05]: I can say yes, but I know that my reasons
and I guess I would rather hear both of
[SPEAKER_05]: yours.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't go for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want me to take it first?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to take it go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great thing for legalization The
people who are doing it right are gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to do it right across the country and
the people that want to come in And take
[SPEAKER_01]: over or come in and corporatize can't
compete Like I don't know any beer
[SPEAKER_01]: drinkers who would be pumped if another's
Coors light came on the market I know a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of beer drinkers who are pumped
regularly about some small craft brewery
[SPEAKER_01]: coming on market People who build up
quality and churn out quality or what we
[SPEAKER_01]: need in this industry federal legalization
opens up Dude, the lab testing problem
[SPEAKER_01]: goes away overnight, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We can use the same Labs to test the
cantaloupe The pesticide goes over it goes
[SPEAKER_01]: out overnight immediately the pesticide
manufacturers are able to run the studies
[SPEAKER_01]: needed to put cannabis on the label All
the ones that already know they can
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's on the label for tobacco
We'll have those studies done in hours all
[SPEAKER_07]: of the seizure Studies would be able to be
done for all of that medical research and
[SPEAKER_01]: adults and have epilepsy Hashtag trips for
tots like I get that Marlowe's gonna come
[SPEAKER_01]: in and plant five or five hundred acres
worth of sugar We eat and roll it up and
[SPEAKER_01]: throw it on the shelf at six and a half
percent pre-rolled joints In a fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: little pack and it's gonna be cute and
it's gonna eat a part of the market for
[SPEAKER_01]: people who don't know any better But I
don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you think there's too much benefit
to it?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's completely federally legal and there
are places and I'm gonna compare it to the
[SPEAKER_07]: beer model like you did there's a cannabis
manufacturer that's the same size as Bush
[SPEAKER_07]: or Coors making producing mass-produced
cannabis or trip free cannabis and then
[SPEAKER_07]: there's Still niche gardens like Green and
Healthy Wellness and a few others There
[SPEAKER_07]: are a few other shops that I totally would
shop at and buy their product,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think that those shops are still
going to survive with that large market?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the Coors type of stores that are
coming out for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, they'll be there'll be a section of
them they get bought up because when when
[SPEAKER_01]: a Marlboro occurs or fuck those companies,
but you go to me Yeah, when they step in
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't create from the ground up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They see what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They hit you in the face with A check
bigger than you've ever imagined you walk
[SPEAKER_01]: away.
[SPEAKER_01]: They replicate your business model as a
franchise And then there's gonna be the
[SPEAKER_01]: people who do this because they love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gonna not sell out They're gonna
slowly expand There's a million people who
[SPEAKER_01]: wish they could just hop online and order
your seeds that can't because it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: legal federally It's a federal offense to
mail those to people they can't buy them
[SPEAKER_01]: like All that goes away overnight people
can just hop online buy your seeds and
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoy life 100% legally without having to
worry about shit and The benefit for the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry sky-high right now There was just
a report that the legal industry is worth
[SPEAKER_01]: four point four billion dollars this year
It's gonna grow to forty billion dollars
[SPEAKER_01]: by 2020 if states continue to legalize
like they have The last estimate I read on
[SPEAKER_01]: the black market was Americans are
Spending 60 billion on marijuana right now
[SPEAKER_01]: You figure a third or more.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the black market markup I mean the
the industry is worth forty four forty
[SPEAKER_01]: five billion dollars Nationwide if you're
able to export to England every now and
[SPEAKER_01]: again or whatever else is other countries
start to legalize and the demand for
[SPEAKER_01]: American quality cannabis Spreads around
the globe That growth is exponential the
[SPEAKER_01]: idea that you're gonna get squeezed out if
you're good at what you're doing and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're a competent Business owners just
not there Mike you ever do a mic drop?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I want to choke the fucking
stoners against legalization like I see
[SPEAKER_01]: people every day online that are actively
lobbying against Whatever legalization
[SPEAKER_01]: efforts going on in their area because it
legalizes marijuana somewhere in between
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohol and tobacco Not like tomatoes so
like you can only produce so much of it
[SPEAKER_01]: there are rules on if you produce it in
your home who you can sell it to or give
[SPEAKER_01]: it away to or not be allowed to sell it to
that's something I was gonna definitely
[SPEAKER_07]: mention is you got to be careful when
you're gonna make the when it goes
[SPEAKER_07]: federally legal we have to be careful
about what we get like what we ask for
[SPEAKER_07]: because there needs to be certain rules
about growing if We're all limited to six
[SPEAKER_07]: plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's gonna fuck some things up.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need reusable numbers more viable plant
numbers we need just A little better rule.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when it comes time, we got to be
careful that we get the right stuff that
[SPEAKER_01]: we want It's so weird in Colorado right
now, especially when we're extrapolating
[SPEAKER_01]: to federal legalization Because right now
those rules really help keep the idiots
[SPEAKER_01]: from fucking this up for all of us Already
we've got major problems mostly PR
[SPEAKER_01]: problems like nobody's been hurt but
massive outdoor grows where Okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: so a few people have been heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a fair head shake but massive
Outdoor grows that piss off the neighbors
[SPEAKER_01]: that lead to articles in the press about
what bastards we are and how the systems
[SPEAKER_01]: being manipulated All of that leads to
major blowback that has political
[SPEAKER_01]: ramifications Including our area possibly
voting to ban the legal marijuana industry
[SPEAKER_01]: this November That's a real fucking
possibility mainly because there's been a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of blowback lately about huge outdoor
grows People with the 20 and 30 plant
[SPEAKER_01]: count doing 20 or 30 VW bus size plants
and they're fucking Suburban backyard like
[SPEAKER_01]: a douchebag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's not allowed Nope,
and it pisses all the neighbors off and it
[SPEAKER_01]: looks terrible in the press And it's gonna
lead to sick kids losing out on their
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine because caregivers are gonna get
quashed here in about five years They're
[SPEAKER_07]: already pushing the caregiver model out of
the Colorado business plan.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's already going away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep and so It's really time like if you
care about marijuana legalization or you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to be part of this industry to really
start paying attention and getting
[SPEAKER_01]: involved Because right now everything is
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually becoming legal everywhere
very slowly, but it's happening like it's
[SPEAKER_01]: we're moving forward every two years and
If people turn out and vote and the
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers that they can Facebook post Bernie
wins in a landslide Huge numbers of
[SPEAKER_01]: congressmen get replaced and we actually
make major progress on marijuana law for
[SPEAKER_01]: the first time federally in 80 years We
can be a part of that revolution.
[SPEAKER_07]: All you got to do is get out there and
vote We already told you who to vote for
[SPEAKER_01]: accidentally We really didn't intend to
endorse a specific candidate beginning of
[SPEAKER_01]: this show But if you're your only vote
topic is marijuana, you really got a vote
[SPEAKER_01]: for Bernie.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah Well, so then I guess that that kind
of leads right there into my next question
[SPEAKER_05]: what serious changes will occur if Bernie
a pro marijuana candidate is elected into
[SPEAKER_05]: office like federally and statewide
Obviously, it'll change the drug
[SPEAKER_05]: classification of it, which will mean that
it'll be able to be studied and all that
[SPEAKER_01]: The change at the federal level is just so
huge we will be able to put our money in a
[SPEAKER_01]: bank We've spent 80 years thinking up ways
to make it harder to grow weed and Every
[SPEAKER_01]: single one of those rules is still in
place for the legal industry And changing
[SPEAKER_01]: the federal law lets us change All of
those the banking the lab testing the
[SPEAKER_01]: packaging requirements the state line
rules I get five calls a week at the shop
[SPEAKER_01]: about people wondering where the buy now
button is on our website Okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: I I get it like you buy everything online
now like you're probably not gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: buying weed online now anytime soon,
but It should be there like everything
[SPEAKER_01]: else and it can be if it's federally legal
but just changing who the president is
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of like the first step and
that's not how we get this battle one
[SPEAKER_01]: Necessarily, that's this the next best
step The real change happens like
[SPEAKER_01]: regardless of who gets elected the next
election Calling your state legislatures
[SPEAKER_01]: calling your state senators Just Google it
figure out who they are It's their job to
[SPEAKER_01]: listen to bullshit when people call them
and you need in the Emirates stuff That's
[SPEAKER_01]: their job is for people that live from
whatever area of the country they're from
[SPEAKER_01]: Call and talk to them and it's their job
to listen And then it's their job to go
[SPEAKER_01]: pass laws based on how many people call
them that week and said vote yes or vote
[SPEAKER_01]: no So literally this stuff matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a number of areas cities towns
Counties that are voting on marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization far ahead of their states.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Just saw New Orleans to criminalized it
fucking Louisiana is never gonna But New
[SPEAKER_01]: Orleans just passed a law maybe not Full
decriminalization, but they just did some
[SPEAKER_01]: sentencing reform guidelines I've been
posting a story all week of about a dude
[SPEAKER_01]: who got 13 years for two joints in New
Orleans.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's ridiculous Yeah, it's part of
there's three strikes in your fuck law.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's enough hash on this table to lock
up everyone in New Orleans.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep Miami, Florida decriminalized it last
year didn't or this year earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so Yeah, I think anything cities
towns and counties everywhere are and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're doing it because The local
officials in those areas Got swamped with
[SPEAKER_01]: pro marijuana supporters calling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I'm a voter in your district.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pro marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's legalize it in the city Enough
people called enough people got active and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what everybody listening to this
show needs to do if you live in another
[SPEAKER_01]: country Unless it's like North Korea odds
are you've got a system of representative
[SPEAKER_01]: government of some sort You can do a lot
of this too because I know we've got a
[SPEAKER_07]: listeners in Australia if you're listening
from North Korea Please send me a tweet
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd love to know if you're listening in
Korea podcast on Twitter I want to know
[SPEAKER_07]: and also huge shout out to our supporter
in Australia.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure we've got several but we've got
one guy out there That is a huge
[SPEAKER_07]: supporter.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up my Rasta friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for listening to the show But yeah
get involved get active because there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot you can do even on a local level if
you live in a state that's Never gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: legalize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might live in a city that will
[SPEAKER_05]: Austin So in your opinion out of the
states that have legalized marijuana
[SPEAKER_05]: already Which state is doing it right in
the way of laws?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like who has a good set of laws put in
place to make a cannabis industry actually
[SPEAKER_01]: grow and not have issues None of them are
perfect yet, but I tend to it might be
[SPEAKER_01]: biased, but I took a quick glance The
rules again today and I vote Colorado by a
[SPEAKER_01]: mile Washington's drastically overtaxing
marijuana and has caused all sorts of
[SPEAKER_01]: price issues and issues industry-wide
Between the city that state the county the
[SPEAKER_01]: in the federal sales taxes that the legal
marijuana industry pays Having a statewide
[SPEAKER_01]: tax rate of 30 35 percent is enough to
keep the shop from being able to profit at
[SPEAKER_01]: all And that's terrible for the industry
keeps it on the black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep If the shops can't profit They can't
pay their people what they're worth they
[SPEAKER_01]: can't provide insurance They can't
reinvest in their business and there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: reason to get involved in it Just stay in
the black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: The black market will be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like it was last year It always
exists it's never going but I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon's got its own issues Whole new set
of issues your whole new set of issues as
[SPEAKER_01]: of yesterday But Colorado is far from
perfect to weird social clubs are very
[SPEAKER_01]: gray area in our law Some areas allow
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: No area has shops up and running where
they're allowed Colorado Springs just
[SPEAKER_01]: voted to ban all the shops They gave them
eight years to shut down which they're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna leave them alone for eight years So
yeah, they're too dangerous to allow to
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to exist so they have to shut
them down But they gave them eight years.
[SPEAKER_07]: They actually they actually said that
they're going to vote again within That
[SPEAKER_07]: eight years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, they're probably gonna vote at least
eight times.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes Hopefully we can turn it around there
So when you guys are writing the rules in
[SPEAKER_07]: your state or city or a county or whatever
it may be on your island In your bubble
[SPEAKER_07]: when you're making the rules for your
cannabis laws Be sure to include some sort
[SPEAKER_07]: of way to consume that cannabis legally
and safely with your friends There are
[SPEAKER_07]: places to go to drink alcohol.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can all go gather I can name 12 places
within five minutes of here that we can
[SPEAKER_07]: all go get drunk Until we fucking die,
but there's nowhere that we can other than
[SPEAKER_07]: right here at this table We can all
congregate and safely consume cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: without any problems We take it as kind of
a given but there's a huge contingent of
[SPEAKER_01]: people out there that want no rules and
they think that's possible and it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: it's Marijuana might be the most safe
intoxicant known to mankind.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be the most beneficial plant
known to mankind None of that means you're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna legalize it to be produced in the
home at any amount with no Regulation or
[SPEAKER_01]: no rules as to how or where it can be
grown like you'll never be able to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: like tomatoes At best you'll be able to
produce it like homebrew alcohol works and
[SPEAKER_01]: We need some of those rules honestly With
the abuses we see just in the legal states
[SPEAKER_01]: that are going now like there are idiots
everywhere like And we kind of have to set
[SPEAKER_01]: up the rules for the slowest link You know
what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like there was the guy growing eight foot
tall trees in his backyard here in our
[SPEAKER_07]: neighborhood Yeah, and some kids tried to
steal his trees and he shot them like
[SPEAKER_01]: thank God.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a fucking pellet gun But there's
been others their home invasion robberies
[SPEAKER_01]: because they've got a ridiculous grow
going and yeah, it's legal here,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude Congrats, bro, but it's not legal
estate over its in fact worth eight
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand a pound and you've got four
hundred thousand dollars worth of
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana and in your suburban backyard in
the ghetto like That's your life like 12
[SPEAKER_01]: times over bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: What were you thinking?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like not only did you put yourself at risk
everybody else in your house at risk your
[SPEAKER_01]: neighbors at risk But you shot the whole
movement in the foot at the same time And
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly don't want my fucking kid
climbing over your fence and stealing your
[SPEAKER_01]: weed when he's 12 Like maybe you shoot
fucking hassle bums like I had to do with
[SPEAKER_07]: boost and I was getting gassed today and a
dude Who looked well like good decent
[SPEAKER_07]: shoes and looked clean.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got an extra couple balls Like what
the fuck does like I didn't even know what
[SPEAKER_07]: to think dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was too big a ask right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's bear change not do you have $47 a
couple of extra balls like Maybe like if I
[SPEAKER_07]: had a road show to hooked you up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do I throw it on a couple of extra ball?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe if I had a nug I might have thrown
it his way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but a nug is a bowl, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean like or I guess I thought about
offering him I was like you should just
[SPEAKER_07]: get in the car and take the biggest
fucking dab You've ever had is what I
[SPEAKER_07]: thought about doing to the kid,
but it wasn't the right time Didn't seem
[SPEAKER_05]: right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, didn't seem right Got more questions
for white Mike.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a couple more questions on the
list.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah Mike got the list also.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, everyone's got the list Okay,
so what other states accept other states
[SPEAKER_01]: medical cards Okay, the only state that
does they call that reciprocity the only
[SPEAKER_01]: state that I know that does that is,
Nevada Okay, and they accept all other
[SPEAKER_01]: states are just as far as I'm aware
Nevada's medical marijuana dispensaries
[SPEAKER_01]: except medical marijuana cards from all
other states Which is great for the
[SPEAKER_01]: medical marijuana?
[SPEAKER_01]: Industry in Nevada because last I checked
they had like twin ten or fourteen
[SPEAKER_07]: thousand patients that just changed a lot
of cool things because one of our very
[SPEAKER_07]: good friends is getting married there on
the 23rd of July and I've been invited to
[SPEAKER_07]: their wedding Nice and so that means that
I can travel and I can stop at a
[SPEAKER_07]: dispensary and I can pick up some
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep I haven't wanted to go to Vegas since
I was like 24 And I suddenly it's back on
[SPEAKER_07]: the list of the to-do's shout out to Arnie
and Reve congrats on the wedding you guys
[SPEAKER_07]: Congrats.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never been to Vegas.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that might have to happen soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a it's you definitely do it a couple
of times before you die I just told
[SPEAKER_07]: everybody that I'll be in Vegas on July
23rd.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I haven't wanted to go to Vegas liquid
drinking and legal weed or legal access to
[SPEAKER_01]: my medical marijuana To be more specific.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think uh, do you think being high
will improve your gambling?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh by miles.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's yo Yeah, see i'm not a
drinker.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what I was gonna say about the
smoke smoking clubs thing Like that's a
[SPEAKER_05]: huge thing for me because I don't drink I
haven't drank in maybe two or three years
[SPEAKER_05]: now Like I don't really do anything else
So smoking is really important to me and
[SPEAKER_05]: like being able to have somewhere to go
and to do that is like really important so
[SPEAKER_05]: knowing that I can go to other states and
like consume cannabis without having any
[SPEAKER_05]: issues or anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a really Um, I think it was matt
that said on a past episode that they made
[SPEAKER_07]: bars so that you don't have people
drinking on the streets all day They need
[SPEAKER_07]: to make cannabis social club so that we're
not out in our car trying to dab At the
[SPEAKER_07]: fucking Safeway parking lot, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we get a dui, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, there's so many different
or some stupid shit, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Legalization doesn't exist in a
vacuum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it has to be practicable just like
everything else And there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people who live in places where they can't
smoke There are a lot of people who live
[SPEAKER_01]: in situations where they can't smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm about to be in one And it gets cold
fucking in colorado during the winter And
[SPEAKER_01]: so you've you know, you need places to go
where you can legally consume You don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to be standing out in an alley if you
don't have to be And there's no reason to
[SPEAKER_01]: have that be the legal consumption method
I fucking hate tourists or telling
[SPEAKER_01]: tourists that just go to the back the
hotel parking lot Like we should have a
[SPEAKER_01]: better answer than that, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Smoke out your car.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I love the points that got made on
That show that last show at canny canyon
[SPEAKER_01]: About like we've got kids now like I don't
necessarily want to explain that like I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to do that on my own time I don't
want to have to explain that shit in the
[SPEAKER_01]: park or fucking anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes signs are one thing like What are
those guys doing over there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that looks fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should we go do that dad?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I want to skip those questions for as
long as possible and if there are
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption clubs that Conversationally
comes up like that if I'm at a consumption
[SPEAKER_01]: club Yeah, right and yeah, that's fucking
on me because I've got my 12 year old the
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption club like I'm the douchebag in
that situation now the guys smoking weed
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys they will not let right?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not even possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can fully have your 12 year old in the
bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just I'm gonna lay that out on the table
It's really got to be hard to telling
[SPEAKER_05]: people that about the hotel Because you're
putting them at risk too because if a cop
[SPEAKER_05]: were to catch them smoking out in the open
They get you know, they still get a fine
[SPEAKER_07]: or whatever it is here and we had a friend
who got caught smoking in a parking lot He
[SPEAKER_07]: didn't have anywhere to be for a little
while He parked underneath the stoplight
[SPEAKER_07]: or the just the light the street light
there and was chilling out Loaded himself
[SPEAKER_07]: up a bowl and took a couple of puffs off
the bowl as he was blown out of hit Cop
[SPEAKER_07]: walked up to his window and knocked on his
window He had no choice but to roll down
[SPEAKER_07]: the window and let the smoke billow out
into the cops face And he just were all he
[SPEAKER_07]: did was write him an illegal possession of
cannabis ticket and he kind of chewed him
[SPEAKER_07]: out He's like you can't fucking smoke here
and my buddy's like I was just waiting I
[SPEAKER_07]: didn't have anywhere to be and he's like,
I don't care.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't fucking smoke here That was our
buddy's fault Yeah, it was 44 his fault.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to 44, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But if there had been a place for him to
go where he could safely consume cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: 44 and 2 If there had been a place for him
to like safely consume cannabis You know
[SPEAKER_05]: that wouldn't have happened that whole
situation wouldn't happen But for our
[SPEAKER_01]: friend 44 and 2 that still would have
happened that way There should be more
[SPEAKER_01]: hotels that cater to the level of tourists
coming through Colorado and they just that
[SPEAKER_01]: part of the industry hasn't caught up yet
I mean come consumption clubs solve a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple hundred different questions about
how legal marijuana works There was a
[SPEAKER_07]: dispensary in Manitou Springs since the
dispensary I work for is not a
[SPEAKER_07]: recreational store It's a medical only I
can tell you about Emerald Fields in
[SPEAKER_07]: Manitou Springs if you're gonna be in the
Manitou Springs, Colorado Springs area and
[SPEAKER_07]: you're looking for Recreational cannabis I
would send you to Emerald Fields.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the vibe and the experience of the
place.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was unlike any other Recreational
dispensary I've ever been to the place was
[SPEAKER_07]: really fucking cool had a neat vibe to it
It's a little overpriced because it's
[SPEAKER_07]: recreational cannabis and I'm used to
playing paying member pricing over green
[SPEAKER_07]: and healthy But the place was cool as
shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Check it out right down the street.
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a 420 friendly hotel in Manitou.
[SPEAKER_07]: They advertise that they are 420 friendly.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're not gonna kick you out I don't
know if you can smoke in the rooms or if
[SPEAKER_07]: they've got like a designated 420 area,
but it advertises 420 friendly on the side
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically if you're coming to
Colorado and you plan to consume cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: The best thing you can do is call around
to several different hotels and just
[SPEAKER_01]: straight up asking what their marijuana
policy is don't use euphemisms Don't let
[SPEAKER_01]: there be any confusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've gotten this phone call eight times
today The person on the other end should
[SPEAKER_07]: just give you a rote response If anybody
from Emerald Fields or that hotel heard
[SPEAKER_07]: any of that you can kindly send an email
with a check in it But yeah, just call and
[SPEAKER_01]: ask what's your marijuana policy they'll
tell you that they'll kick you out for
[SPEAKER_01]: consuming on property and a story They'll
tell you that they don't allow you to
[SPEAKER_01]: consume inside, but they have a smoking
patio There is one hotel on the south side
[SPEAKER_07]: of Pueblo that is cannabis friendly,
but I cannot recall which hotel The one I
[SPEAKER_01]: used to send people to I sent a guy to the
other night and I got a call back maybe 45
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes after I had this conversation He
was like, no, they said they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore and he yelled at me and I had to
leave And I felt really bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, dude My bad, but yeah it There's
just some Colorado's got the best set
[SPEAKER_01]: allows so far in my opinion, but we've
still got some serious Serious holes in
[SPEAKER_01]: our law right now that need to be fixed.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a couple of classier hotels in
Denver I don't know if I even want to say
[SPEAKER_07]: the names of the places But I if you we go
for the Cannabis Cup and when we go for
[SPEAKER_07]: the cup we get expensive hotels not to be
an asshole Yeah, when we go to Denver,
[SPEAKER_07]: we would go get fucking high-end hotels
We're gonna be kind of assholes about it
[SPEAKER_07]: and eat lunch on the balcony and well,
there's a work trip spoil yourself a
[SPEAKER_07]: little bit Yeah, yeah, and so if you told
the people at the desk like so what's the
[SPEAKER_07]: The smoking fee and they're like,
it's $500 here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we're gonna be here for three days
There's eight of us throwing out like 40
[SPEAKER_07]: bucks each or 50 bucks each or was that I
don't know I can't do math this quickly
[SPEAKER_07]: while I'm talking about it But if we
divide the wheel divided the smoking fee
[SPEAKER_07]: like can you just bill us for that and not
fuck with us and like, okay And they just
[SPEAKER_07]: let us pay the $500 smoking what they were
gonna charge us.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's Three hundred paid in advance like
we're going to smoke this bitch out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, okay, they just let us do
that There are other hotels that won't let
[SPEAKER_01]: you smoke them out, but Some of or all of
their rooms have balconies And some of
[SPEAKER_01]: them are more or less lenient with just go
out on the balcony and puff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Others have straight-up told people
just go to the back of our parking lot And
[SPEAKER_01]: every time I drive by one of them I see
like three people standing in this parking
[SPEAKER_07]: lot just in the back corners The Warwick
has killer balconies That's all I'm saying
[SPEAKER_05]: the balcony at the Warwick is rad there's
actually a little smoking club in Denver
[SPEAKER_05]: called I Bake or I baked.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I bake.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you guys ever been?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so I visited Colorado twice before I
moved out here and both times that I
[SPEAKER_05]: visited I tried to go there and like they
don't open until noon or something like
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my Overly excited woke up too early,
you know So I was not prepared for
[SPEAKER_05]: something to not be open till noon and I
was not ready to wait to smoke a blunt.
[SPEAKER_05]: So But anyways, but yeah, so I have never
actually been there but apparently that is
[SPEAKER_05]: a really chill like no entry fee No
nothing place.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're ever in Denver and you want
to check that place out that uh That's a
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis smoking club.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bake you can hit my PayPal There's a
there's a bunch of speakeasy style
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis clubs around Denver and other
cities in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just If they were legal,
it'd be simple, you know, I shout out the
[SPEAKER_07]: Canyon Canyon all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really had fun at the dab lounge a
couple of weekends ago with Steve DeFino
[SPEAKER_07]: doing the veteran farmers alliance And
then I went to the speakeasy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the 420 speakeasy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's next door to the lazy lion It's a
completely different vibe than both
[SPEAKER_07]: places.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got a big stage and there was a band
playing and there are pool tables There
[SPEAKER_07]: are a lot of options.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really enjoyed all three of those clubs
on a different level I just prefer the
[SPEAKER_07]: Canyon Canyon because it's got this
hardwood floors leather couches.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just classy as fuck It's funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: I always explain the smoking clubs in
Colorado Springs if you're trying to Go
[SPEAKER_05]: with people who you're trying to I
wouldn't even say distract But there's a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of TVs and a lot of things to do at
the lion So you don't necessarily have to
[SPEAKER_05]: interact with people?
[SPEAKER_05]: The dab lounge is the same way right and
but can a canyon is where you go with your
[SPEAKER_05]: like true friends to like sit down and

can go with their friends socialize a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit consume some cannabis Safely
out of public view like away from people
[SPEAKER_01]: who aren't interested in it I mean,

[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis and hang out with a whole bunch
of their friends and meet Adam ill this

nationwide He really focuses on the state
[SPEAKER_07]: and the local, but he knows his shit all
statewide I'm kind of like a heroin junkie
[SPEAKER_01]: in that fashion Like when I wake up in the
morning one of the first things I do is
[SPEAKER_01]: hop online and check a couple of different
really good news sources for what's going
[SPEAKER_01]: on in marijuana today And I have to like
it's a fucking compulsion after all these
[SPEAKER_01]: years When I don't get to do it in the

my good friend, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_07]: I miss you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll always love you, bro.

to our friend, Lindsay, who kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: co-hosted the last episode.

[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, thanks for doing a kick-ass job.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, you said that you sounded like a total
dork in a comment on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_07]: You did not sound like a total dork.
[SPEAKER_07]: You sounded like a total bad-ass.
[SPEAKER_07]: You are welcome back on the show anytime
you would like.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I sent you a message.
[SPEAKER_07]: You didn't reply.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, we'll see what's up with that
after I record.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, come back on the show,
Lindsay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also a big shout out to Mike.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, thanks for helping me put together a
great episode.
[SPEAKER_07]: I could not have done that show without
both of your help.
[SPEAKER_07]: So shout out, much respect and big thanks.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to start off this episode.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, we will do a couple of grow questions,
but I want to start off by reading some of
[SPEAKER_07]: the comments that I have got here on
iTunes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually pulling up those comments
right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to take a second.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pulling up the comments.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm getting there.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to leave a comment on the
podcast, all you got to do is go to
[SPEAKER_07]: iTunes, go to the iTunes store,
type in grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll bring up the grow from your heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go down to the bottom, click on podcast,
click on the icon that shows my face and
[SPEAKER_07]: the title.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there will be an area where it
says details, ratings and reviews and
[SPEAKER_07]: related.
[SPEAKER_07]: All you got to do is click on ratings and
reviews.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where I just clicked and I can see
all of your reviews.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's go ahead and read.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got three new comments.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go read three, all three of these
new reviews.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to kick down this music.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the first comment says, Oh,
I didn't scroll down far enough.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why that seemed weird.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: The first comment says it's from our
friend, Jay Jeslik, uh, Jay Jeslik Veda.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I said that wrong, but I really
tried to say it right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, the comment goes like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and we've got a five star rating.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, the comment goes like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks man for great teaching and your
great attitude.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've learned a ton and I hope you continue
your great work.
[SPEAKER_07]: Episode 113 is amazing by the way.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm sure it will help me more than I
can now foresee once I have those
[SPEAKER_07]: checklists set up for use.
[SPEAKER_07]: Peace out old man John.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey John, I'm glad episode 113 helped you
out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad that grow room checklist is going
to come in handy for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've done episodes about planning your
grow room and I've done episodes about
[SPEAKER_07]: building your grow room and I've done an
episode about planning a perpetual grow or
[SPEAKER_07]: a perpetual harvest.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think if you go back and listen to
those episodes, they were really compound
[SPEAKER_07]: with episode 113 and you will have a great
start to growing your own cannabis when
[SPEAKER_07]: the time comes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So big shout out to Jay Jeslik Veda or old
man John, as he signed the email or the
[SPEAKER_07]: message, a shout out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for the five star review and thanks
for the review.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the next one comes from my buddy Rasta
Ralph 719.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up dreadlock brother?
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for leaving a comment on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_07]: He gives me a five star rating and he says
mad props.
[SPEAKER_07]: The comment says, thanks for all you do
brother.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey Ralph, thanks for growing out my
seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for being a bad-ass dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for being a Rasta.

the podcast.

shelf homie.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this person gave us another five star
review.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually the review came today.
[SPEAKER_07]: The comment goes like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to be honest.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the first podcast I've ever
listened to and I'm hooked.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've listened to 21 episodes in two days.
[SPEAKER_07]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like you never turned off the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty rad.
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet my voice is embedded in your head by
now.
[SPEAKER_07]: 21 episodes in two days.
[SPEAKER_07]: Stoked on all the new info I've learned.
[SPEAKER_07]: All great info and good vibes.
[SPEAKER_07]: The homie Spencer turned me on to your
podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: He always gives me good info and glad to
have found another source of great info.
[SPEAKER_07]: Love learning new things about this
incredible plant slash medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep up the great work.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look forward to listening to all of them
and all the new stuff you put up.
[SPEAKER_07]: One love homie.

[SPEAKER_07]: Big, huge shout out for the five star
rating.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, huge shout out to Spencer for
introducing people to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big shout out to my ninja, Spence.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, you guys, that is all of the
new iTunes comments.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to thank everybody that left a
comment, the old comments and the new
[SPEAKER_07]: comments.
[SPEAKER_07]: I definitely appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got quite a few comments up here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got 31 five star reviews.
[SPEAKER_07]: We do not have any reviews that did not
get five stars.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it'd be cool if you go to iTunes,
throw up a five star rating, give me a
[SPEAKER_07]: little comment.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me know what you think about the show
and I will read your comment on a future
[SPEAKER_07]: episode.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what that will do is help me move up
in the iTunes ranking and more people will
[SPEAKER_07]: see the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: More people will start listening to the
show.
[SPEAKER_07]: More people will grow better cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: More people will support the legalization
movement.
[SPEAKER_07]: It will just help out cannabis altogether.
[SPEAKER_07]: So please do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks again to everybody that sent a
comment.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a bunch of emails now that I
would like to quickly read so that we can
[SPEAKER_07]: move on into some grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me get these comments up on there.
[SPEAKER_07]: These emails up on the screen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes I'm not sure if you guys want me
to say your actual names or email
[SPEAKER_07]: addresses or whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to try to remember to not do
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes I take too many dads and I blurt
out people's names and shit, but we're
[SPEAKER_07]: going to do our best to not do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: This first email was sent to me with the
subject to love the podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was looking for a cool podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: That nerds out on growing and the GWYH
podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the GFYH.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're close.
[SPEAKER_07]: Grow with your heart is what I think you
meant.
[SPEAKER_07]: A GFYH podcast is perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: I listened to a bunch of podcasts and
yours is the best.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been an underground grower for the
last decade, but just got my med license
[SPEAKER_07]: up here in the Northwest about two years
ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this whole legal cannabis world blows
my mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've gone to some growers conferences,
but I don't know if I'll ever be able to
[SPEAKER_07]: adapt to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really appreciate the 411 from Jeff.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm completely self-taught hydro grower.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who learned from trial and error,
but the masterclass and the way Jeff lays
[SPEAKER_07]: out info is magnificent.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've learned so much just from the few
episodes I've had time to catch.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really hope you guys keep it up as it's
a tremendous service to the other growers
[SPEAKER_07]: out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: That kind of email is what makes all of my
effort to do this show worth my time and
[SPEAKER_07]: energy, you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: It feels good to hear people say that I'm
laying out the information in a way that
[SPEAKER_07]: you can understand it because that was my
mission.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of what prompted me to do this
podcast was reading things on the internet
[SPEAKER_07]: in forums where people were trusting grow
advice and people were giving terrible,
[SPEAKER_07]: shitty, false advice that were going to
cause more problems or they were giving
[SPEAKER_07]: advice that were simply based on product
use.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, oh, you've got spider mines,
buy this product.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then all you're going to be doing is
buying that product for the rest of your
[SPEAKER_07]: grow career.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're never going to eliminate the mites.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're just going to be chasing them down
with the product.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it'd be wiser to come on here
and teach you how to get rid of those damn
[SPEAKER_07]: mites, how to fix your room, understand
where the mites are coming from.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do appreciate that you understand and
appreciate the way I'm laying things out.
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing you said was that my podcast is
the best.
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate that, but I'm not in
competition with anybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know the other shows out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes I listen to some of them because
I like to hear what's going on and I like
[SPEAKER_07]: to gain the other info, but I'm really not
in any competition with anybody else.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do appreciate hearing that you think
I'm the best.
[SPEAKER_07]: If there were a podcast award or something
and you chose to give it to me,
[SPEAKER_07]: I definitely would not decline that shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: So thanks for that huge compliment and
thank you for the email.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I'm going to pull up another
email.
[SPEAKER_07]: This one says, good morning, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just sent a big thanks your way on
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm taking notes to set up my first
professional room.
[SPEAKER_07]: You talked to me into organics.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a specific question for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: In an 11 by 11 room, how much area should
I have for a veg room and a flower room?
[SPEAKER_07]: I was thinking six by 11 flower and a four
by five veg room.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then he shows a little picture here,
how he divided the room.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like what you've done.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got an 11 by 11 flower.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got himself a four by five veg and a
seven by five work area.
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing I don't really,
I'm not super stoked about is that seven
[SPEAKER_07]: by five work area.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that's not a lot of space to do
work, but what actually are you going to
[SPEAKER_07]: be doing in there that you need to take
room from your grow space to dedicate to
[SPEAKER_07]: the work?
[SPEAKER_07]: I would add another foot onto that veg
area.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do a five by five veg area and keep that
six by 11 flower just like it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: The six by 11 flower is nice and tight.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not going to lose too much light.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would recommend hanging two 1000 watt
lights in your six by 11 and maybe 1000
[SPEAKER_07]: watt in your five by five veg is what I
would recommend.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure that that's what you're going
to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you listen to my perpetual grow
episode, the one five by five and the two
[SPEAKER_07]: lights in the six by 11 will really crush
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll be able to do huge shit in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it'd work out for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure why you want a seven by five
work area.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not going to use that much space.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mostly what you're going to be doing is
mixing nutrients.
[SPEAKER_07]: You may have, I don't know if you plan on
working in the plants in there,
[SPEAKER_07]: but you can work on the plants in the
flower room if you need to top them,
[SPEAKER_07]: lollipop them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe you'll be transplanting or something
in there, but I really wouldn't,
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to call it a waste,
but it is almost a waste of space to use
[SPEAKER_07]: it as a work area as opposed to part of
the growth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Space.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can work in growth space if that,
if it comes down to that, if you really
[SPEAKER_07]: want it to, you could eliminate that
workspace and almost add a whole nother
[SPEAKER_07]: light with that space.
[SPEAKER_07]: We could totally do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I just read your email and I answered
that and confused you more or helped you
[SPEAKER_07]: out, send me more details and we will
narrow this down and get this room right
[SPEAKER_07]: for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get it perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be sexy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, good job planning a room.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a lot of people actually go and write
that shit down.
[SPEAKER_07]: So props for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also thanks for sending me an email.
[SPEAKER_07]: I look forward to your reply.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get into our next email.
[SPEAKER_07]: This one was headlined tinctures and it
says, Jeff, Hey man, Floridian here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been listening to your show.
[SPEAKER_07]: His name's not Floridian by the way.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's from Florida is what I think that
meant.
[SPEAKER_07]: He says, I've been listening to your show
just so I can keep tabs on the industry
[SPEAKER_07]: and culture in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a smoker, but I respect and
support the rights of those who are
[SPEAKER_07]: respect.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's more to this email, but I want to
jump in and say that's rad because at the
[SPEAKER_07]: start of the show, I say if you're just
curious about the current state of
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis, this is the show for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this guy right here is the guy who
was only curious about the current state
[SPEAKER_07]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're aiming the show right at him and
it hit him and he's listening.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect bond right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_07]: He goes on to say, anyway, I know someone
who is having trouble sleeping and I heard
[SPEAKER_07]: THC tinctures work well for that and fast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you direct me to some information
about tincture varieties, dosage and
[SPEAKER_07]: potency?
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, do you know roughly how much an
average bottle costs in the Colorado
[SPEAKER_07]: marketplace?
[SPEAKER_07]: If you had a show that covers the topic,
I'd love to know which one or perhaps you
[SPEAKER_07]: can talk a little about this in a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then he says word and signed his not
real name.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we could say your name since you
called yourself Jaydog, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So shout out to Jaydog for sending me an
email.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to get my friend Fox to come on the
show and talk a little bit about
[SPEAKER_07]: tinctures.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fox, you were invited on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fox just moved near me.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you got to come be on the show,
dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about tinctures and help this
guy and his friends out.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I can tell you about tincture.
[SPEAKER_07]: You asked a couple of things here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I direct you to some info such as
dosage and potency?
[SPEAKER_07]: Dosage is based on potency.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you come to Colorado,
you can buy a bottle of tincture that will
[SPEAKER_07]: have the exact potency per dose printed on
the bottle.
[SPEAKER_07]: It will say if you take, it'll probably be
like an ounce or a two ounce bottle.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll say if you drink this whole ounce,
you'll probably consume 250 milligrams of
[SPEAKER_07]: THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you are a new consumer, I think we
recommend 25 milligrams as the starting
[SPEAKER_07]: dose.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want 25 milligrams of cannabinoid,
of THC in your body to start with.
[SPEAKER_07]: Eat that.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's tincture, you just basically drink
it, put it in a medicine dropper,
[SPEAKER_07]: put it into some coffee, put it into some
juice.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just pour it right down the throat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just drink it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It tastes pretty good.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got like a warm honey kind of flavor.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take 25 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take enough tincture that will contain 25
milligrams and wait about 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: See if you see any effect.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't, take another 25 milligram
dose.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can always take more tincture,
but you can't undo how much tincture
[SPEAKER_07]: you've taken and a tincture high comes on
quickly.
[SPEAKER_07]: When it is appropriately dosed,
it can be strong.
[SPEAKER_07]: It will hit you and you will feel it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dosage is based on potency.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say take 25 milligrams at a time
and work your way up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless you come to Colorado or a medical
state, it'll be hard to judge the potency
[SPEAKER_07]: of your tincture, honestly.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's dosage.
[SPEAKER_07]: You asked about sativas and indicas.
[SPEAKER_07]: Indicas would definitely be better for the
sleep, in my opinion, if you're trying to
[SPEAKER_07]: put your body to relax mode, you want some
indica, you may want some CBD in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: CBD may help your body relax.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll just make you chill out a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: That may help you sleep.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would recommend a heavy indica or
something with some CBD in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll definitely help with the sleep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you say, also, do you know roughly
how much an average bottle costs in
[SPEAKER_07]: Colorado?
[SPEAKER_07]: The price is going to vary from shop to
shop, and it will certainly vary between
[SPEAKER_07]: medical and recreational facilities.
[SPEAKER_07]: In a medical facility, I think the average
price of an edible, which includes
[SPEAKER_07]: tinctures, is going to be around $10 to
$15 per 100 milligrams of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_07]: If there's 100 milligrams of THC in there,
it's probably going to cost you $10 to
[SPEAKER_07]: $15.
[SPEAKER_07]: If there's 200, expect to spend 20 to 25,
maybe 30.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're getting up in the 300
milligrams, look to spend 30 to 45 bucks.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the scale that I have seen it
working on.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is not hard and fast at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Trust me, that is not solid anywhere,
but that's what I've seen.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about 10 bucks for 100 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you go to a recreational market,
place, it'll probably be one and a half
[SPEAKER_07]: times that much.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're looking at 15 to 20 bucks for your
100 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're looking at somewhere between 30 to
50 bucks for a 200 milligram edible in
[SPEAKER_07]: some of the recreational facilities,
but they do have a huge markup because
[SPEAKER_07]: they know people are coming from all over
the country, all over the world,
[SPEAKER_07]: and they will pay the price just to have
the experience and have the access.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how much you should expect to pay.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will get our friend Kabuki J.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fox on here.
[SPEAKER_07]: What up, Kabuki?
[SPEAKER_07]: I need you on the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do an episode a little bit more
about tinctures.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the tinctures will hit you
quickly.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they will work to help your friend
get some sleep.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to come to Colorado and get it.
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing I can recommend is full CBD.
[SPEAKER_07]: CBD is legal nationwide.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can find CBD that was derived from
cannabis or hemp and is all organic,
[SPEAKER_07]: natural CBD, you can consume, possess,
you can have CBD products.
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as they don't have THC in them,
you can have CBD products in Florida.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are companies that will send CBD to
you in Florida.
[SPEAKER_07]: Try that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't get anything from China.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure it's made in America.
[SPEAKER_07]: Try to find a reputable source.
[SPEAKER_07]: Try that out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe that will work for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my advice.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say thanks for that email.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for supporting the show,
JDog.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope I gave you some good info.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have more questions, please feel
free to email them to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love to help your friend get some
good rest.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also thanks for trying to get some
info for your friend.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good friend.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fist bump.
[SPEAKER_07]: Much respect.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our next email comes from... Oh,
that's right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to say this guy's name.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our next email is a headlined or subjected
aquaponics grower.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he says, Hi there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I recently found your podcast after
someone recommended it to me and I really
[SPEAKER_07]: enjoy the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been working on perfecting cannabis
growing in aquaponics for the past few
[SPEAKER_07]: years and was curious if you've ever had
anyone on the show to talk about the
[SPEAKER_07]: aquaponics growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you are ever looking for someone to
talk about the differences about growing
[SPEAKER_07]: in aquaponics, I would love to.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for taking the time to read my
email and I look forward to hearing back
[SPEAKER_07]: from you.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let me get right to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am not very experienced in aquaponics
growing, but I would love to hear what
[SPEAKER_07]: you've got to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to be on the show,
we can set up maybe a FaceTime interview.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we could do it through Skype or
something.
[SPEAKER_07]: FaceTime would be the easiest for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're listening to this episode and
you sent me the email about aquaponics
[SPEAKER_07]: growing, please contact me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Send me another email.
[SPEAKER_07]: We will set up a way to get you on this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've got an iPhone or a MacBook or a
Golden, all we've got to do is make a
[SPEAKER_07]: quick phone call.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can record.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd love to get you on the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure a lot of people would love to
know about aquaponics growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry I don't have any more
information for you on it, but by the
[SPEAKER_07]: looks of it, you've got it all figured
out.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd love to get you on the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing I want to mention is this guy's
email said that he learned about the show
[SPEAKER_07]: after someone recommended it to him.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, what I would like for you to do
is recommend my podcast to three of your
[SPEAKER_07]: friends.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, three of them, because only
one of them is going to actually end up
[SPEAKER_07]: becoming a subscriber and a long-time
listener.
[SPEAKER_07]: But tell three people, maybe you'll tell
somebody that smokes cannabis every day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe you'll tell somebody that grows
cannabis every day, or maybe you'll tell
[SPEAKER_07]: people that are afraid of cannabis and
need to learn the truth about cannabis and
[SPEAKER_07]: realize that there's a guy out here that
smokes more hash than most people could
[SPEAKER_07]: even imagine every single day.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm able to put together a podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a solid career.
[SPEAKER_07]: I own multiple companies.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got my shit together.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe this podcast can free up some myths
and get people out of the dark ages when
[SPEAKER_07]: it comes to cannabis mindset.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So introduce three people to my show.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want to thank my friend with his
aquaponic email.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a great email.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope we can get you on the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got another email.
[SPEAKER_07]: This one is kind of long, but it goes like
this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much for taking the time
out once again and answering my emails.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, this is from a guy that I replied to
before.
[SPEAKER_07]: And his name, we've said his name on the
show before.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is from the Tri County Bandit.
[SPEAKER_07]: He says, thank you very much for taking
time out once again and answering my
[SPEAKER_07]: emails.
[SPEAKER_07]: Real talk.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're a real person, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for taking up most of the show
for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I guess it's partly my fault for the
long winded email.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me try and be brief.
[SPEAKER_07]: As you were explaining to me on the
podcast about phenotypical expressions and
[SPEAKER_07]: my environment, it dawned on me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been growing out different strains
now and they all seem to be very heavy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been wondering what the fuck has been
going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know pistols are good, but it seems I
get a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to see my trikes, which are
there, but it seems like I have to trim
[SPEAKER_07]: the hairs back to see the actual bud mass.
[SPEAKER_07]: Could this be a sign of bad environment or
lacking something there in?
[SPEAKER_07]: Shit's dank though, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I ain't mad, but the bottom of my jars
are just loaded with hairs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can my trimming be really shitty?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you get this problem or have you ever
known anyone who has?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think maybe it has to deal with the
humidity maybe as Florida gets 95% most of
[SPEAKER_07]: the year.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd love to hear that future podcast on
selecting a male for breeding.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just did that one, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's out.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I hope you heard that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I start my garden from regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: So naturally some males sprout and I would
love to recreate more seeds for myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, thanks again for giving a shit,
man.
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate your input on my eating.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not vegan or shit, man, but I'm not
even a vegetarian, but I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_07]: change my habits.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've noticed that on the weeks where I
have salads and water, I feel the best.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love to hear about some good
recipes if you got some, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: And hey, I hear it if you're not the Susie
Homemaker types.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not trying to give me recipes,
but let me know what's on Ross and Jeff's
[SPEAKER_07]: weekly menu.
[SPEAKER_07]: Never really met any vegans.
[SPEAKER_07]: I only heard about them on the radio and
TV.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't imagine what you would do without
meat or eggs.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't eat eggs either, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn, my bad.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jeff got really baked and listened to the
show like twice, stoned again and wrote
[SPEAKER_07]: this email.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry for the ramble.
[SPEAKER_07]: So much for keeping it brief.
[SPEAKER_07]: This does not have to be on the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: It can be, if you'd like much love,
Tri County Bandit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Guess what, bro?
[SPEAKER_07]: Your whole damn email made it to the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me back up and I will answer some of
your questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, your buds are airy because it's too
hot, probably.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think your buds are getting airy and
fluffy because it's too hot and too humid
[SPEAKER_07]: in your grow space.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to give it some more cool air,
possibly back the lights up from the
[SPEAKER_07]: plants a little bit and lower the
humidity.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure if you're growing indoors or
outdoors, but you need lower humidity and
[SPEAKER_07]: probably some more fans.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool those plants off.
[SPEAKER_07]: So think about in the summer, when it gets
real hot, your plants are puffing out
[SPEAKER_07]: because they're trying to get off of each
other so that they aren't like,
[SPEAKER_07]: you don't... All right, this is the only
way I can describe it, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the summertime, your balls hang real
low because it's hot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your balls don't want to be up by your
body because it's all hot and sweaty
[SPEAKER_07]: there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they try to creep away from your body a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your plants are doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: The calyxes are trying to get away from
each other because it's too hot.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're getting sweaty on each other.
[SPEAKER_07]: So give them some cool space, cool it
down, and then they'll get nice and tight.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll get a little smaller.
[SPEAKER_07]: You notice what happens to your nut sack
when it's all cold.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just goes boom and you get a little
coin purse.
[SPEAKER_07]: Same things happen into your plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bro, I cannot believe I just said that on
the podcast, but it's the only way I've
[SPEAKER_07]: got to describe this.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so the next part, you talk
about eating naturally.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a vegan.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me clear that one up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am not vegan.
[SPEAKER_07]: One day per week, I do eat a vegan diet.
[SPEAKER_07]: One day per week, I do not include any
animals in my eating one day out of the
[SPEAKER_07]: week.
[SPEAKER_07]: That day out of the week could be any
random day.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't do it every Thursday.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't do it every Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just make a conscious effort to one day
weekly, not eat any animal products.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am always a vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do not consume any flesh of any animal.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't eat fish.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't eat chicken.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't eat meat of any kind at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't eat bacon.
[SPEAKER_07]: I won't eat your pizza if it had a
pepperoni on it and you peeled the
[SPEAKER_07]: pepperoni off.
[SPEAKER_07]: I still don't want that shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how I roll.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a vegan, just a strict vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you asked about some recipes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, bro, I am a terrible vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_07]: I eat a shit ton of pizza.
[SPEAKER_07]: I eat a bunch of pasta and I eat a bunch
of salads.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a bachelor.
[SPEAKER_07]: I eat on the go most of the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a lot of my diet consists of Thai food.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love a lot of Pad Thai.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love a lot of rice meals.
[SPEAKER_07]: I eat a lot of eggplant.
[SPEAKER_07]: I eat a lot of bananas.
[SPEAKER_07]: Almost every meal I eat has an avocado
involved in some way, shape or form.
[SPEAKER_07]: I drink a lot of kombucha teas.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like probiotics.
[SPEAKER_07]: I drink a lot of coconut water.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of stuff that I eat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of fruits and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been trying to replace all of my
snacks.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I want a sugary snack or a granola bar
or some shit like that, I try to replace
[SPEAKER_07]: it with maybe a small handful of peanuts
and some fruit because sometimes I want
[SPEAKER_07]: some crunch and I used to just reach for a
candy bar or a bag of chips or some crap,
[SPEAKER_07]: but now I just eat some pistachios or some
almonds and then some fruit to go with
[SPEAKER_07]: that to give it some sweetness and some
flavor and get that crunch.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the kind of stuff that I like to
snack on.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of pasta, lots of fruits and
vegetables, lots of salads, lots of stuff
[SPEAKER_07]: like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, definitely not the Suzy Homemaker
type, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am not the super chef vegetarian guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: You said something about eggs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I won't fry up eggs and eat them.
[SPEAKER_07]: I won't have an omelet, but I will eat
something that's got eggs in it like a
[SPEAKER_07]: cake or something like that if I do eat,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: I would eat something like that,
but I'm not just going to go fry up some
[SPEAKER_07]: eggs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I replied to your rambly ass message with
a bunch of rambles myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope I made some sense for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do appreciate you sending me messages

[SPEAKER_07]: I am on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's at GFYH Podcast and I'm on Facebook
under Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just give us a search.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you were on Instagram, check me out

[SPEAKER_07]: It's iree underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_07]: I use my seed company name, iree genetics
on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: Check us out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I post a bunch of great cannabis
photography.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, you guys, that's all the emails
and comments I've got for you for tonight.
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to take a quick break.
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to take a drink and then we're
going to come back with a couple of really
[SPEAKER_07]: simple grow tips that will really help out
your garden.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hang on for just one second and I will be
right back.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am back and I'm officially dabbed the
fuck out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again, big shout out to my friends at
Turpex.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I said I was going to come back and
give you guys some grow tips.
[SPEAKER_07]: The other day I was talking to a friend
and he was telling me about his garden and
[SPEAKER_07]: he said he was running three or four
different strains and he was running his
[SPEAKER_07]: lights 24 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the plants are in a vegetative stage
and he said that one strain in the room is
[SPEAKER_07]: trying to start flowering while they are
in veg.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he said he's ran this cut a couple of
times and it's done it both times.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he was freaking out, very curious why
his plants are auto flowering when they're
[SPEAKER_07]: not auto flower plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a couple of things that can make
this happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: In my opinion, from what this guy says,
I feel like his plants are root bound.
[SPEAKER_07]: When your plants get root bound,
that means that the roots have filled up
[SPEAKER_07]: the entire soil area.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no more space in the container for
roots to grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now the plant is growing, the roots are
pressing up against themselves.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that plant knows my container is full.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nowhere for me to stretch out my
legs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got to do something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now the only real thing that a cannabis
plant can do at that point is flower.
[SPEAKER_07]: It wants to create buds.
[SPEAKER_07]: It wants to make calyxes or pistols or
pollen so that it can breed and continue
[SPEAKER_07]: on the species.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that plant goes into flower mode to
protect itself.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's basically the plant's job.
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, oh shit, I could die.
[SPEAKER_07]: I better start flowering.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what I think is happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think his plants are getting root bound.
[SPEAKER_07]: Root bound plants will show signs of auto
flower.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you don't up pot them or fix the
problem, they will go into full flower on
[SPEAKER_07]: you and you won't be able to stop it.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another thing that I think may be causing
these plants to go root bound or plants
[SPEAKER_07]: could go root bound from this is a lack of
light.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of times I noticed that if a plant
is not getting enough light at the very
[SPEAKER_07]: bottom area, that's where it will start to
auto flower.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your very bottom branches will start
showing calyx pistols popping up early or
[SPEAKER_07]: it's too early.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're popping up early.
[SPEAKER_07]: They shouldn't be there yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's probably because the lower part of
that plant is not getting enough light.
[SPEAKER_07]: All of the leaves up top or the plants
next door are blocking out the light.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that plant is going to auto flower
because it's not getting light and it's
[SPEAKER_07]: trying to protect itself.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again, this type of thing is way more
common.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're using like T fives or T eights
or fluorescence, or maybe LEDs,
[SPEAKER_07]: if you're using Gavitas, you won't see as
much auto flower from lack of light.
[SPEAKER_07]: As you do with the smaller compact
fluorescence and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a lot of the problem could be lack of
light.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or another thing that is very possible is
not a proper light cycle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Plants flower based on photo period.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every plant has got what it's called a
critical photo period.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some plants will actually begin to flower
under 14 hours of daylight.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to reduce it to 12.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why outdoors you see some plants
starting to flower before our natural
[SPEAKER_07]: cycle gets to 12, 12.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there is a critical period on your
plants and some plants will flower early.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, if you stress plants, they will
start to flower on you because they know
[SPEAKER_07]: that they're going to die.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the main three causes of an auto
flowering plant that is not meant to auto
[SPEAKER_07]: flower are root bound, not enough light,
and maybe not a correct photo period for
[SPEAKER_07]: that particular cultivar.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the first thing I would always check is
to make sure your plant's not root bound.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it is, all you've got to do is put it
into a bigger pot.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really not that much of a challenge.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're starting to flower, I usually
try not to transplant plants during the
[SPEAKER_07]: flowering phase because that can really
shock them.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you're severely root bound,
go for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just do it because your plant will
appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to spend some energy stretching
out its roots, but it'll be worth it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll get a bigger plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll get a better quality product if you
do it correctly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just be extra careful not to stress out
your plant and disrupt those exposed roots
[SPEAKER_07]: too much when you're doing the up pot.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's enough for that question.
[SPEAKER_07]: The other question that a friend brought
to me was why are these plants not
[SPEAKER_07]: finishing?
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, these plants have been in this
garden for 14 weeks.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're still airy.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're still fluffy.
[SPEAKER_07]: The calyxes are not done.
[SPEAKER_07]: The trichomes are not amber.
[SPEAKER_07]: The pistils have not gotten orange yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything is still going.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got more time to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: What is happening?
[SPEAKER_07]: So this kind of goes back to earlier when
I was talking about the critical period.
[SPEAKER_07]: Plants that flower for a long time are
usually from a more tropical climate
[SPEAKER_07]: somewhere near the equator.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they get longer days.
[SPEAKER_07]: So these plants are expecting the season
to only change by about an hour or two.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what I would recommend to make these
plants speed up their flowering process is
[SPEAKER_07]: around week nine or 10, start reducing the
timer on your daylight cycle.
[SPEAKER_07]: So instead of going 12-12, maybe start
going to like 11 hours and 30 minutes,
[SPEAKER_07]: and then just start working it down until
finally you're down at like eight hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then those plants will really start to
speed up.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll make the plants get more dense.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll make the trichomes start to turn
amber.
[SPEAKER_07]: The plants will know that winter is
coming.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just got to tell them.
[SPEAKER_07]: If nothing changes in that room,
those plants will not change because
[SPEAKER_07]: they're just used to being out by the
equator.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're used to being in the jungle
somewhere where it's sunshining.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're getting all kinds of sun.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just not ready for the time to
end.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, you guys, that is all of the
episode I've got for you this week.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like I've been going on for a long
