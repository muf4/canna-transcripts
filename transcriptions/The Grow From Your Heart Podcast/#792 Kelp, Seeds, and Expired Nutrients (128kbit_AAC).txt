[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, now here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode 792 of the grow from your
heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a fun episode lined up for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I am going to give away a
free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've teamed up with our friends at seeds
here now.com to give away a free pack of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk more about that later in the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to remind you that I read
genetics will be at the dude grows cup
[SPEAKER_01]: this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dude grows cup is happening again June
3rd, just outside of Fort Collins,
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check out dgccup.com for all
of the information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, I don't want to ramble too much
at the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a fun opening subject to jump
into.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to talk about expired nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working with a friend online who's
been asking me a bunch of questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been trying to figure out why their
grow just doesn't look right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've checked on the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've checked on the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've checked on the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: We checked on the the lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: We checked on the feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: We checked on the scheduling.
[SPEAKER_01]: We checked on the runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We checked everything we could think of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today it was discovered that we were
feeding those plants expired nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not at that grow personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing everything through email and
through FaceTime, but they opened up a
[SPEAKER_01]: bottle today and it smelled terrible and
they realized these nutrients are expired.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been in the grow for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did not realize that bottle has met
its time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my advice to you is go in the grow and
make sure that none of your products are
[SPEAKER_01]: expired because we've been chasing a
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been trying to help a friend in there
grow for quite a while and they discovered
[SPEAKER_01]: that the whole problem was an expired
bottle of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't there to smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't there to inspect it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what it looked or smelled
like, but maybe we would have caught that
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier if we would have just cracked it
open, given it a smell because today they
[SPEAKER_01]: said it smelled terrible and putrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think and assume that that has been the
culprit of our plant problem in that
[SPEAKER_01]: facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once again, my advice to you,
if you've had a big bottle sitting on the
[SPEAKER_01]: shelf, if you've got a bunch of bottles
that are sitting around that you don't use
[SPEAKER_01]: very often, maybe give them a shake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they've gotten runny or maybe
they've gotten chunky.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if those products are still good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they smell real bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they're supposed to smell bad and
now they smell good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to tell with some grown
nutrients, but there should be an
[SPEAKER_01]: expiration date printed on those bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: My advice to you is go check and see if
your products are out of date.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also check your pesticides and while
you're at it, check all of your other gear
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do an inventory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just do a regroup while we're at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: While you're checking the pesticides and
the nutrients, do an inventory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do a restock overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit, add gloves to the list while
you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the main piece of advice I want you to
take away from there is make sure the
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients aren't expired.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been feeding a grow for the past few
weeks with an expired bottle and the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants look like shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't look like shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just don't look turbo.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should be turbo by now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look kind of normal and we wanted
turbo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's that expired bottle that's making
them slow down and not perky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check on your stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to segue into the email portion
of today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a lot of great questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: These questions do come from the grow help
tab on the iReGenetics website.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to my website, iregenetics.com,
there's a row of tabs at the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Toward the right, on the right top part of
the page, there's a tab that says grow
[SPEAKER_01]: help or grow questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you click on there, it will bring you
to a, it's like a little questionnaire.
[SPEAKER_01]: It asks you a bunch of questions about
your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, where are you growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you indoors or outdoors?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your temps?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your humidity?
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the things I need to know to help
me diagnose your problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really helps out if I've got more info.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fill that out the best you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the bottom, it says type in your grow
question or tell us about your problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fill that in the best you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me details.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it also gives you the opportunity to
attach photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got good photos that may help
send those right along.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I do read your grow question here
on the podcast, I will send you a free
[SPEAKER_01]: pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that free pack of seeds is sponsored
by our friends at seedsherenow.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to seedsherenow.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need regular feminized auto flower
seeds, I definitely recommend seedsherenow
[SPEAKER_01]: .com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am rambling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying to avoid that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, this message came from the
grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check the grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me your questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one says, it says, first of all,
I love and appreciate you, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big love and respect back at you,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says in some of your strain videos,
which we love, you say in early flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: you use kelp to enhance the turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you please elaborate on how you use
the kelp?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have age old kelp and I have fed it
lightly once in veg and once in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm currently in week two of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got shredder and orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_01]: They seem to love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't want to overdo it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay sexy, my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came from our friend who wants to
be known as Billy D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to our buddy, Billy D.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and I'm going to mention, they
referred to what I call, what they call
[SPEAKER_01]: the strain videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you scroll through my channel,
you will see that there are many strain
[SPEAKER_01]: episodes, strain videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do, I of course, am iRegenetics premium
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make seeds for iRegenetics and I do put
out episodes that highlight those strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll teach you how to grow them,
give you advice about those strains and
[SPEAKER_01]: set you up for success with the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which we do make, but in those episodes,
I do mention a lot of kelp products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mention any specific products,
but I do mention kelp products quite
[SPEAKER_01]: frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say that it's a good idea to use kelp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like in, um, in my opinion,
in my experience in strains that are
[SPEAKER_01]: skunky, funky, earthy, cushy, uh,
those strains that, that smell,
[SPEAKER_01]: that aroma, that flavor, that funk can be
enhanced and really brought out with the
[SPEAKER_01]: addition of kelp products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just feel like it makes it if it's
musty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And funky kelp will make it mustier and
funkier.
[SPEAKER_01]: If those are even real words as musty or a
real word, it'll be more musty in my
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you use that kelp aroma and flavor are
not the only benefits of using a kelp
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also feel like, uh, the proper use of
kelp will increase in, uh, bud density.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it always does help with root
development that think of that natural sea
[SPEAKER_01]: life, uh, kelp grows kelp is one of the
largest growing organic bodies on earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I read that correctly, I didn't recite
that the way that I read it, but kelp
[SPEAKER_01]: grows large, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And imagine feeding that bio life to your
ganja plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are going to grow life.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to grow large.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kelp is always good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It enhances root growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It enhances flavor, aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also think it helps with bud
density.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is why I talk about kelp in a lot
of those episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, anything that's skunky, funky,
gassy, cushy in that realm, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: give it more kelp.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fruity things will like the kelp as
well, and it will make the flavor
[SPEAKER_01]: stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really think it enhances that
funkiness of a naturally funky smelling
kelp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk a little bit about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, elaborate on how I use kelp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there are several ways to make kelp
available to your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are liquid kelp products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there are dried kelp products.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a kelp meal product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about your approach to growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of depends on how you want to do
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got age old kelp, which is a
beautiful product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Age old is a really, it's a old brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make a quality product and they've
got a kelp specific product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're right in the right wheelhouse
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that is a liquid kelp product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, another liquid kelp product I would
recommend that I really enjoy is liquid
[SPEAKER_01]: karma.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, that brand was, uh, bought by
somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the botanic care brand was bought by
somebody, which we try not to buy their
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, no matter how great that product
is, I'm still torn sometimes when I do
[SPEAKER_01]: choose to buy it, uh, that's called liquid
karma.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a brand out there called raw that
makes a powdered kelp product,
[SPEAKER_01]: raw nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're powdered.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's R A W raw is the name of the brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they make a great powdered kelp
product and the folks that make Fox farms
[SPEAKER_01]: product make a kelp product.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is called kelp me, kelp you,
all of those products will be easy to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they're all cost effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all quite affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the liquid karma and some of your,
uh, liquid kelp products can actually be
[SPEAKER_01]: used as a foliar feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would imagine you could use the raw
powdered kelp as a foliar.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, uh, shake it up and dissolve it
really well before you apply it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't quote me on that because I have
not used that product, but most kelp
[SPEAKER_01]: products, you can follow your feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as they don't gum up your system,
as long as they aren't too, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: too thick when you apply it so that it
doesn't clog up your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so, uh, how to use it, how to use the
kelp.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says so far that you have used the kelp
once in veg and, uh, one time week two and
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a good start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on the products you choose to
use and how you were growing, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: that will kind of dictate how you use the
kelp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about a couple of ways that I
would recommend using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to grow in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in cocoa, I would probably add a kelp
product once a week throughout most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire cycle of that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, once it goes into its big veg pot,
uh, then I'm going to start adding some
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of a kelp product weekly,
uh, all the way up to probably about week
[SPEAKER_01]: six or maybe even week seven of flower,
depending on how long that plant is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from week, uh, early in veg,
all the way through veg, all the way
[SPEAKER_01]: through flower up until, uh, right about
almost pre flush time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically I am feeding a kelp product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the trick to that is I slowly increase
that product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I can't tell you how many milliliters
or how many grams or how much to use,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I'm not sure which product you're
going to use, but my advice is start low
[SPEAKER_01]: and then just work your way up a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go drastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go crazy, but do increase a little
bit toward it.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time you get done, uh, with the
flowering stage that you were probably at
[SPEAKER_01]: the full recommended dose, which is
written on that bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the time I'll recommend feeding
50% of the recommend recommended dosage of
[SPEAKER_01]: a product because the plants usually don't
need what they recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nutrient company wants you to buy
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they tell you to feed a little bit
extra, start off with about 50%,
[SPEAKER_01]: work your way up by the time you're done
with the kelp product.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when I think you should probably be
at that 100% mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: So about week six, uh, and just slowly
work your way up to there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be huge, huge steps,
just gradual increases over every couple
[SPEAKER_01]: of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, with the liquid product in cocoa,
I would do cocoa, uh, once a week and I
[SPEAKER_01]: would slowly step up, start low,
and then work your way up to the
[SPEAKER_01]: recommended dosage by the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, then what else, how else are we going
to grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to grow in a soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, with a soilless mix, I would probably
do it once again, once per week,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I may go a little bit heavier with the
dosage this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may not go as light as I do in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what's left, I wrote down hydro,
hydro is our last option to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I would do hydro very similarly to the
other two, but in a hydro reservoir,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can only feed, basically we're feeding
once a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mix it up and let it run for the week
in a hydro res.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so I would do it basically every week
from the time the plants get big and
[SPEAKER_01]: established and get sturdy and healthy,
start adding that kelp product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like I said before, start low and
then work your way up, uh, in those hydro
[SPEAKER_01]: buckets and in cocoa, you're definitely
going to notice, uh, the kelp product.
[SPEAKER_01]: More quickly than you are in the soilless
mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you want to add this to some sort
of a living soil or one of those no-till
[SPEAKER_01]: beds, uh, disclaimer, this is not my area
of expertise when it comes to no-till,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, organics, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not my area of expertise,
but that is when you're going to want to
[SPEAKER_01]: stir in that kelp product early in,
uh, stir that in before you mix it into
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil, uh, before you even start
putting the plants in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you might want to top dress or top
feed it later on with the kelp product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could put the kelp in with water,
uh, feed it that way, or you can top dress
[SPEAKER_01]: it, let it break down into the soil that
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, once again, I am not the organics
expert, but those are two, three very
[SPEAKER_01]: viable options to get plants, uh,
the kelp product with you are using
[SPEAKER_01]: organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So quick recap there, uh, hydro,
basically hydro, soilless mix,
[SPEAKER_01]: cocoa, almost everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would feed it once per week and I would
start low and I would gradually taper up
[SPEAKER_01]: until you're going about a hundred
percent, maybe a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you really want to push it 120% of what
the recommended dosage is at the end,
[SPEAKER_01]: start low and work your way up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go burning the plants and pay
attention just because I'm saying that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can get to a hundred, maybe 120 doesn't
mean that your plant is going to take
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these plants are a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pay really close attention to your plan
or the leaves curling is the growth
[SPEAKER_01]: stunted as something going weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be a sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back off if you see too much reaction
from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I answered this question,
elaborate on how I use the kelp,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, feed it just like any other nutrient
and feed it about once a week and then
[SPEAKER_01]: start early and work your way on up until
you're going kind of hard with the kelp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the gassier and funkier,
uh, cushier sort of a riot tools,
[SPEAKER_01]: the chem dogs and things, they really
love, uh, this sort of treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really love the camp of the kelp
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also the cushions and chems, if you're
going to do some kelp, add some cow mag to
[SPEAKER_01]: that mix as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they will really love each other
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, my friend, Billy D,
thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since I read your question here on the
podcast, that means that you win a free
[SPEAKER_01]: pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You win a free pack of, I read genetic
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, that free seed giveaway is
sponsored by my friends at seeds here now
[SPEAKER_01]: .com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to seeds here now.com for giving
you a free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's jump into one more
message here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came also from the grow help tab
from, does it say what they want their
[SPEAKER_01]: name to be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does not have their name on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, yo Rasta Jeff, you inspired me to
start breeding and I'm not going to lie to
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to start my line with your line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I chose soccer souffle to start my
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that is a huge compliment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many breeders out there get pissy and get
territorial when people talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding with their products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I promote it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I endorse it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can donate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really encourage people to breed with my
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, if you want to breed with my
products, that that's a compliment to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would I be mad that you want to use my
creations to start your new creations?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a huge compliment to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, why would I be mad at a person for
trying to breed their own cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: make themselves a self sustainable and
enjoy cannabis a little bit more,
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoy the plant, the craft, the art,
develop some skills.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would I be mad at anybody about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the bottom line is here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You bought those seeds, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: You paid money for them or you traded for
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully you did it honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if you got those seeds, honestly,
then you can grow them, breed them,
[SPEAKER_01]: trade them, sell them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could do whatever you want with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say anything about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the money that I needed when you
bought them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after that, bro, it's all yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like you telling me that I can't
skate my skateboard hard or drive my car
[SPEAKER_01]: fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I paid for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do my thing, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do that thing with your seeds,
but I want to keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I, I appreciate that and encourage it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breed with my stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I chose Saka Souffle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, biscotti is my favorite strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to find a great biscotti
flavored mail in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I have a couple of questions for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you make seeds, how long do you veg
your plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if you were in my position and chose
Saka Souffle to start your breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: project, how long would you veg it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Since you know that particular cultivar
very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there's a couple of things that get my
attention in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I would recommend if you're
going to breed with this plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: that you grow out several phenotypes of it
multiple times and get a relationship with
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to do a phenol hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm assuming you've got a 10, which
probably came with 12 seeds in the pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got 10 or 12 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, uh, maybe you share that with a
friend, but I'm going to say grow as many
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds as you can identify the females,
identify the males, separate them,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then flower them out and find what is
the best for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to find a male that looks
like he's the stud, the dude, the stud,
[SPEAKER_01]: the guy, keep him aside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we've got to run the females a couple
of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to see, unless you want to
pollinate multiple females, if you just
[SPEAKER_01]: want to do one and one, you really have to
do some careful selection and you can't do
[SPEAKER_01]: that on just one run.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd recommend running it two, maybe three
times unless you plan on pollinating
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would run it the first time,
find the boys, find the girls,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of, this is just an audition run.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just kind of getting to know them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second run, we're really going to
isolate two or three girls that we really
[SPEAKER_01]: like and see which one is the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we'll breed to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's grow it a little bit, find out if
there's any problems with this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I doubt there will be, but I could have
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be, I bred this plant and I'm
still going to say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be intersex.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be a mutant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be a fucking freak show of a
plant that doesn't do what you want done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's not get too, uh, too attached to
breeding with this plant right away
[SPEAKER_01]: because it may not fit the criteria,
which you're hoping for just because your
[SPEAKER_01]: favorite plant is biscotti and there's
biscotti in here doesn't mean that this is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be a breeding winner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would like to say it is because I
made it, but still it may not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be that's the chances of reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the chances of genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like, it's like dating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we're not going to get along.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're the plant and that,
and you aren't going to get along.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So run them a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if it's really what you want
before you do the breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's talk on touch on the actual
breeding question.
[SPEAKER_01]: How big would I veg the plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, maybe I shouldn't tell you all this
information, but come on in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time to, uh, reveal some,
some breeding secrets.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't really need a lot of space or
really big plants to create a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, if you're going to breed with
the biscotti and you just want to make
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds for yourself, you can make a hundred
seeds from a plant grown in a beer cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not joking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not exaggerating at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: A beer cup is this tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can veg the plant to be this tall ish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you're watching on the
video, but it's half, maybe three quarters
[SPEAKER_01]: the size.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the beer cups, this tall, veg it to
about half three quarters the size of the
[SPEAKER_01]: beer cup and then flip it and then
pollinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you pollinate two or three of those
plants that are the same size,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the same clone, you're going to
make a couple of hundred seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably a hundred to 200 seeds really
easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the plant's real little, you'll still
pull 30 to 50 seeds off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need a lot of biomass to
pollinate the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be really little.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just want to make some for
yourself, my advice is to veg them in
[SPEAKER_01]: cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get them about, what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: GI Joe is three and three quarters of an
inch tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Veg them GI Joe tall, and then flower
them, uh, the male and the female at the
[SPEAKER_01]: same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put them in there, let them go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be a good, first practice
breeding run.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see what the flowers, what the male
plant does all the way through the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see what the females do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see what pollination looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see what ripe and mature seeds look
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see how long it takes and you'll
have a good batch of seeds to play with.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you really want to get critical with
it, you can time the male and female
[SPEAKER_01]: differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know when the male is going to
dump pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know when the female will be ready
for pollen exactly because I haven't ran
[SPEAKER_01]: these plants yet, but the way nature
works, if you put them side by side and
[SPEAKER_01]: put them into flower, they will,
the pollination will work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may make more seeds if you do one
earlier, one later, but let's worry about
[SPEAKER_01]: that on your second and third breeding
runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just put the appropriate boy and
appropriate girl in there and put them in
[SPEAKER_01]: at the same time and you'll make plenty of
seeds for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to make just enough seeds
for yourself to play with, beer cups,
[SPEAKER_01]: one gallon pots, uh, small plants,
you just need one top cola, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: the size of He-Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I'm using fucking toys from the
nineties and eighties is size reference
[SPEAKER_01]: today, but, uh, vegetal to GI Joe and
He-Man size plant will give you 30 to 50
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds if you do it properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you'll get 90 to a hundred seeds
out of a little tiny plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just depends on how much biomass is on
that plant to receive, uh, how many
[SPEAKER_01]: pistols are there to receive pollen,
to create seeds out of those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to make more seeds,
grow bigger plants, but honestly,
[SPEAKER_01]: the beer cup method is really simple to do
and it does not take a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, just make sure that those seeds get
time to finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be one of the most
important things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, select your female or females,
select your male, get a clone,
[SPEAKER_01]: have backups, have backup plants of these
in case something goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that we can replicate this
procedure in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got your backups, get clones,
put the clones into the beer cups and get
[SPEAKER_01]: those beer cups growing about the size of
GI Joe three and three quarters of an inch
[SPEAKER_01]: tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put the male and female or females into
your flowering chamber.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even saying flowering room at this
time because these plants are so little,
[SPEAKER_01]: they get a chamber.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't need a whole room to
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just need, you could do this in a,
a very small, a two by two by four foot
[SPEAKER_01]: space.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could definitely bang out plenty of
seeds with the right length.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the right light, with the right
cooling, with the right ventilation,
[SPEAKER_01]: with paying the right attention and timing
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So put them in that room, let them
pollinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll get it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then six, seven, eight or nine weeks
from there, you will have a small batch of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then here's the fun part.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get to grow all of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't share them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't give them away until you've ran a
few and verified that they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: problematic until you're confident in
those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me check on the message and make
sure that I actually answered some of your
[SPEAKER_01]: question here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, when you make seeds, how long do you
let your plants veg?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if I was in your position.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I would do it in beer cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, you're just trying to make a few
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know if these seeds are going to
be amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know if they're going to be
intersex.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know if they're going to be duds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know what you're creating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's not make too many of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to throw away 90 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really hurts your feelings to throw
away 9,000 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had to do it before.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the only thing you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put them in the compost bin because if I
put those seeds out to you guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to be angry at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to be happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to tarnish the reputation,
the level of quality that you expect from
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make little plants, make a few and
maybe to you, a hundred is a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make a few seeds to play with,
grow them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we can always go back and make more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you did it right, you probably
found the keeper that you want in that 30
[SPEAKER_01]: to 50 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, there will be something hot in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've done this properly, I'm really
curious if you're going to use my soccer
[SPEAKER_01]: souffle as a male plant, uh, which females
are you going to pollinate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there, is there more advice on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to use the soccer souffle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what are you going to pollinate?
[SPEAKER_01]: What, uh, what is the other plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: In the mix here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope, no advice on that one, but I'm
excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, and once again, I do encourage
everybody out there to breed with my
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to be a seed breeder,
a seed maker, my seeds are a great way to
[SPEAKER_01]: start that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, once you do make those little,
uh, little cups worth of seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you really like something and you want
to make more, obviously the next step is
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow those plants bigger next time and
make bigger plants in a three gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you let that plant veg up to 12 or 18
inches tall time, that pollination,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have enough seeds to last.
[SPEAKER_01]: You the rest of your life, just from one
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just want to run those seeds by
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That question did come from a person who
did not indicate if they didn't or did not
[SPEAKER_01]: want their name to be said, but if you're
