[SPEAKER_01]: heart podcast this episode is brought to

[SPEAKER_01]: time to add new genetics to your garden
and you can get them at dank seed dot
[SPEAKER_01]: store ladies and gentlemen across the
table from me it's white mike welcome to
[SPEAKER_00]: the show bro thanks man what's up
everybody thanks for coming and hanging
[SPEAKER_01]: out with us bro yeah man it's a weird
foggy evening out there this is a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bizarre a little bizarre is a great
description is that foggy or just so many
[SPEAKER_01]: dabs in the room uh it smells like i said
it smells like rocks and water and mike
[SPEAKER_01]: looked at me like i was weird and he goes
yeah you're right yep he did not want to
[SPEAKER_01]: agree with that it smells like fog yeah it
smells like fog it smells like like hard
[SPEAKER_01]: water if you're from colorado you know
what that smells like welcome to the show
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody this is not going to be the hard
hard water podcast we're actually going to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about some cannabis related stuff it
has become a tradition that we start the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast off by talking about what we're
dabbing i have got kind of a buffet of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis concentrates here on the table i
don't remember which ones i did and did
[SPEAKER_01]: not dab i remember that the strawberry
daiquiri really stood out to me so let's
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about strawberry daiquiri it was
really sweet it had a great flavor to it
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the strawberry strains kind of have
a similar flavor in my mind that
[SPEAKER_01]: strawberry candy but there's also like a
dusty sort of a thing behind it it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: the old half chewy strawberry candy oh the
ones with the uh the goo in the middle it
[SPEAKER_01]: was hard on the outside gooey in the
middle and it had like a strawberry look
[SPEAKER_01]: like a fake strawberry wrapper on it yeah
that's kind of what it tastes like dude
[SPEAKER_01]: you are accurate uh this label here says
it is 70 6.1 percent thc and 90.3 percent
[SPEAKER_01]: total cannabinoids it doesn't list those
other cannabinoids but it claims that they
[SPEAKER_01]: are there i got me fairly nicely buzzed
obviously i'm rambly that could be a
[SPEAKER_00]: combination of all of these concentrates
we had a few of them there's a nice little
[SPEAKER_00]: selection do you remember what you just
took a dab of not off the top of my head i
[SPEAKER_00]: would have to look at the labels that
means that it must have worked good we'd
[SPEAKER_01]: just sound like assholes if we just read
through that list of options so right you
[SPEAKER_01]: can look quickly what got your attention
there it was one of the tribes it was
[SPEAKER_01]: either star tribe or lost tribe the star
tribe because i asked you what do you
[SPEAKER_00]: expect a star because i remember the last
tribe the the smell was too spot on with
[SPEAKER_00]: the name it was all grassy and body odor
okay and so i set that one down with star
[SPEAKER_01]: okay and grassy and body odor for some
people they're gonna go hey i want to dab
[SPEAKER_00]: that it actually it's it's not a bad dab
it's just not what i was in the mood for
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly that's why i like the variety i've
got strawberry i've got oranges i've got
[SPEAKER_01]: the star dog which is that feely and
fruity flavor there's some jilly bean
[SPEAKER_01]: there's some super silver haze it's got
that uh i think it's almost got that dryer
[SPEAKER_01]: sheet aroma that i talk about i just said
i wasn't gonna list all the concentrates
[SPEAKER_01]: so we're gonna stop there we're making
people jealous and mad at us people like
[SPEAKER_00]: come on guys i'm out here in whatever
state i'm in get it legal in your area i
[SPEAKER_01]: got a message from somebody in there
saying hey you talk about the colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: crunch check this out and they squeezed
their buds on a video and they're like
[SPEAKER_01]: this is what the dispensary here sells us
and it just exploded it was like and i was
[SPEAKER_01]: like ah man it was kind of similar to
maybe some bottom of the jar colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: crunch stuff real hard he told me the
pricing uh he's paying around 60 and
[SPEAKER_01]: eighth and i was like oh man you're paying
three times the price but it's just as
[SPEAKER_01]: crunchy like similar crunch yeah the herb
didn't look bad but it was crunchy it is
[SPEAKER_00]: uh there's some questionable shit
everywhere everywhere i loved the colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: crunch episode though when i was
budtending all those moons ago that uh was
[SPEAKER_00]: a common thing people come in and like the
place i hit last time all the herb was dry
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like dude it's colorado yeah we don't
have water here right notice how you're
[SPEAKER_01]: putting on lotion all the time and you're
all dry and flaky and that's yeah the weed
[SPEAKER_00]: fills it also yep you really don't it's
that or bavita flavor like take your pick
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah i'm not sure which one i would prefer
yep the dry the dry because then it tastes
[SPEAKER_00]: like herb i want that herb flavor actually
have two grinders every now and then when
[SPEAKER_00]: you get some nice moist herb like the
grinder i normally use doesn't handle it
[SPEAKER_01]: well so you actually switch up grinders
for two different batches of herbs yeah if
[SPEAKER_00]: i notice it's not if uh the herbs got a
little more moisture content to it and my
[SPEAKER_00]: my daily use grinder is kind of chewing on
it and not grinding it down into the next
[SPEAKER_01]: chamber i'll switch grinders that's pretty
fucking pretty fucking funny then do you
[SPEAKER_01]: combine the two batches and mix them
together so that you've got a little even
[SPEAKER_00]: i i prefer to smoke blends at the house so
i'll buy six or seven different eighths
[SPEAKER_00]: and then pull a little nug out of each
throw them into the grinder and can just
[SPEAKER_00]: combine them back and forth so yeah
there's a lot of or mixing and blending
[SPEAKER_01]: for bowls there are people just smashing
their phones onto the table listening to
[SPEAKER_01]: us they're going i live in prohibition
land and i hate you guys right now it's
[SPEAKER_01]: join us don't be don't be mad embrace it
uh be be glad that we're bringing you to
[SPEAKER_01]: the table and letting you participate with
us you know it's got to be frustrating
[SPEAKER_01]: though to be somewhere where you can't
even have concentrates it can't even have
[SPEAKER_01]: access to good flour but uh we've got it
here so do what you can do in your area to
[SPEAKER_01]: legalize cannabis so that you can consume
it have access to it you said something
[SPEAKER_01]: funny a minute ago um i wanted to this was
totally not on my list of stuff to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about you know what really drives me crazy
is when people say uh that this place has
[SPEAKER_01]: the best herb or this state has the best
herb or this state has yeah bro i bet you
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the best growers on the planet are
just tucked away in places we don't even
[SPEAKER_01]: know about it's the places that you never
get to try their product you'll never know
[SPEAKER_01]: who they are they're quiet they're hermits
there's good herb everywhere we got to
[SPEAKER_01]: quit saying that this one state has the
best this other has the best yeah colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: has a reputation for drying crunchy herb
we won but you know what california's got
[SPEAKER_01]: a reputation for right now a bunch of
fucking pesticides i'd rather smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: crunchy herb over pesticide herb like but
we got to stop the whole competition thing
[SPEAKER_01]: i don't think that you can't say cali has
the best have you smoked every grower in
[SPEAKER_01]: colorado's herb have you smoked every
grower in oregon's product but it's it
[SPEAKER_00]: varies so much harvest to harvest grower
absolutely up the herb grown up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mountains is a lot different than the
stuff grown down here in the valley my
[SPEAKER_01]: summer and winter crops in the same grow
room are going to be different just
[SPEAKER_01]: because i'm fighting different
environmental factors i'm going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: different uh vpds based on the outside
environment a little bit uh the rooftop
[SPEAKER_01]: air conditioners can't handle some shit in
the winter that air conditioner return may
[SPEAKER_01]: bring in a little extra cold yeah i was
just thinking of the fog rolling in and i
[SPEAKER_00]: was like you never know what's going to
happen and it varies batch to batch and
[SPEAKER_00]: room to room and grow to grow grower to
grow grower harvest to harvest and that
[SPEAKER_01]: room has been corrected by the week as the
fog used to come in and air conditioner
[SPEAKER_01]: return in a facility mike and i used to be
involved in it doesn't anymore but that
[SPEAKER_01]: was a really funny morning came in and the
grow room was foggy from outside yep it uh
[SPEAKER_00]: i mean it's gonna vary wildly but i think
there are some places where good herb is a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot easier to find than other places right
um man when i've spent time on the east
[SPEAKER_00]: coast like i know there's good weed there
it's just not obvious like it is here yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't i still see people smoking herb
from time to time out in the world it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just it's really bad herb but there are
also there's got to be i'm sure every
[SPEAKER_01]: state in every town probably there's got
to be yeah there's just one look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers that is just cranking out some
fire it may not get anywhere it may stay
[SPEAKER_01]: in his jar but or his little circle yeah
or his his little crew yeah let's if you
[SPEAKER_00]: look at how the cannabis industry
developed over the last 30 years for most
[SPEAKER_00]: of the country it's little home growers
selling to five six eight nine ten fifteen
[SPEAKER_00]: people and those people each have six
eight ten fifteen customers and that's as
[SPEAKER_00]: far as that little bubble goes um and so
it looks like one of those little star
[SPEAKER_00]: graphs where there's a little line and
then a circle and then little lines coming
[SPEAKER_00]: off that circle the other little dots
right bad description there but you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: know what i'm talking about it's a cluster
it's a grower in the middle and then
[SPEAKER_01]: little spider legs come off of it and then
you got uh guys that buy quarter pounds
[SPEAKER_01]: and then off the quarter pound guys you
got guys that buy ounces and off the ounce
[SPEAKER_01]: guys you guys mostly probably buy eights
and quarters after that like it just
[SPEAKER_00]: breaks down and there's the new kid who
wants to start dealing who takes all the
[SPEAKER_01]: people who want to buy grams yep he gets a
quarter and sells enough grams to make
[SPEAKER_00]: himself a gram yep yep take a quarter
break it into seven grams smoke one sell
[SPEAKER_00]: six have enough money to buy the next
quarter it's got to be frustrating it's so
[SPEAKER_00]: many people started yep that's how yeah
but that's the system coast to coast and
[SPEAKER_00]: so i'm sure there's phenomenal growers in
in parts of the south and parts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: east coast where you wouldn't think of is
herb centric but uh you gotta come west
[SPEAKER_01]: people just to see what you're missing i
know some really good growers down south
[SPEAKER_01]: we just can't talk too much about them
right allegedly allegedly there could be
[SPEAKER_00]: some good growers down south i know as i
see pictures all the time i was like this
[SPEAKER_00]: is allegedly mississippi but it looks fire
this is from new orleans it looks fire um
[SPEAKER_00]: i see stuff in new york that's i've smoked
shit in new york that was amazing right
[SPEAKER_01]: well there's some famous product that
comes from new york and it's expensive as
[SPEAKER_01]: shit in new york yeah mike's eyes lit up
like this is small town new york not new
[SPEAKER_00]: york city it was so expensive but it was
worth it and now people are going to say
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive because expensive is very
relative based on location it depends on
[SPEAKER_01]: where you are we saw prices drop here
drastically it's i always laugh when
[SPEAKER_00]: people say the black market is flourishing
in legal pot states and it's like really
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah well it went it's hard it went from
four thousand a pound to one thousand a
[SPEAKER_00]: pound or less quickly ten years very
quickly in ten years doesn't sound like a
[SPEAKER_01]: long time but when it goes from four
thousand to one thousand in ten years that
[SPEAKER_01]: is if you're if you were somebody who was
kind of used to having that sort of income
[SPEAKER_00]: it made a huge change in your life it
fully used to be possible to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable living as a single adult male
with three or four lights four lights was
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect if you had four bloom lights in a
little clone area with a t5 you could make
[SPEAKER_00]: a comfortable living yeah um not anymore
no now that no that's all those people in
[SPEAKER_00]: colorado have either moved to prohibition
land or gotten into a different part of
[SPEAKER_01]: the game or they're employed in the legal
cannabis industry at this point because
[SPEAKER_01]: they already know how to grow all right so
i've got an email from a listener this is
[SPEAKER_01]: the part of the podcast that i actually
had written down on my notes i think this
[SPEAKER_01]: is a great email i'm scrolling down to the
actual good part i've got a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: replies going on here so this one comes
from somebody who we're going to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: their name anonymous for reasons that you
will understand as the anonymous thanks
[SPEAKER_01]: for emailing yeah what's up anonymous by
the way before we get too far in this if
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd like to send me an email my email
address is grow from your heart at hotmail
[SPEAKER_01]: .com i would love to have your email as a

compliments i'm saying that a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people do reach out with them and i love
all of the compliments i'll get to reading
[SPEAKER_01]: a few of those on the show anything you'd
like to say you can address myself
[SPEAKER_01]: anything you want to say to mike anything
about the show reach out grow from your
[SPEAKER_01]: heart at hotmail.com mike's looking around
the room like you've got a dryer sheet
[SPEAKER_01]: smelling at nowhere that's strange you're
gonna have a stroke maybe we'll keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: that's almonds bro i'm not i thought it
was toast it was i think we read different
[SPEAKER_01]: books yes we read different books all
right mike a long time ago you told me
[SPEAKER_01]: something that i thought was really funny
you said you know it takes out more
[SPEAKER_01]: gardens than police you know it takes out
more gardens than bugs you know it takes
[SPEAKER_01]: out more gardens than thieves and
criminals and i said what is this thing
[SPEAKER_01]: you're talking about that takes out a lot
of gardens so mike well i've got you here
[SPEAKER_01]: on the microphone remind everybody what
takes out so many gardens angry
[SPEAKER_01]: girlfriends bro angry girlfriends bro
without hesitation you knew where i was
[SPEAKER_01]: headed with that yes um one of my golden
rules is don't tell people about your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden never tell other people about your
garden i'm a giant hypocrite i come on
[SPEAKER_01]: social media i come up here on a podcast
and i talk about i grow cannabis yes i
[SPEAKER_01]: live in colorado i run a commercial
facility where we've got millions of
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars in licensing thousands of
equipment we pay a bunch of taxes they
[SPEAKER_01]: know we're there there's nothing to hide
got a commercial facility i do consulting
[SPEAKER_01]: for a lot of places i'm able to do my job
and talk about it i don't know your
[SPEAKER_01]: situation i don't know where you're
located i don't know who you are i don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know who you associate with i don't know
who your local sheriff is i don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on wherever you are if you're
a new grower one of my first pieces of
[SPEAKER_01]: advice is to stfu shut the fuck up there's
no need to talk about it no need to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about it and i know again i'm a hypocrite
i love to post cannabis pictures i'm in
[SPEAKER_01]: colorado if you can cover yourself do it
if you're somewhere in an illegal state if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're somewhere in a medical state and
you are unsure of your surroundings just
[SPEAKER_01]: don't talk about it there's no need don't
take your best friend there don't take
[SPEAKER_01]: your cousin there there's no need to even
take your brother there especially don't
[SPEAKER_01]: take a new relationship there i was going
to say girlfriend but it's 2019 it could
[SPEAKER_01]: be your boyfriend it could be your
girlfriend you could be dating a space
[SPEAKER_01]: alien that identifies as a dolphin don't
take that person there they still identify
[SPEAKER_01]: as a person if they're a space alien slash
dolphin right probably i'm going to call
[SPEAKER_00]: them a person just because it's getting
confusing the reason we phrase this rule
[SPEAKER_00]: like we do is because when this rule was
the golden rule or became the golden rule
[SPEAKER_00]: growers were predominantly young white
males sorry that's just how it was no
[SPEAKER_00]: you're absolutely right so it was girl
ex-girlfriends and girlfriends ruined the
[SPEAKER_00]: most the highest percentage of grows more
than user error more than cops more than
[SPEAKER_00]: other criminals breaking up it's it kills
more gardens than fucking anything else
[SPEAKER_01]: more gardens than anything else all right
so that that brings us to this email i
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know what my face just made a really
weird noise i hope nobody else heard that
[SPEAKER_01]: that brings us to this email it goes a lot
like this it says hey rasta jeff i'm
[SPEAKER_01]: writing you from prohibition land and i've
made a huge mistake i broke your rule
[SPEAKER_01]: about not telling anyone even your
girlfriend this guy already done fucked up
[SPEAKER_01]: we told you so bro not to rub it in he
goes on to say predictably breaking up
[SPEAKER_01]: with her was a gigantic mistake no it
wasn't dude if this is how it turned out
[SPEAKER_01]: it wasn't a mistake i'm glad you finally
did it bro headache pain in the ass etc
[SPEAKER_01]: but doesn't sound like a mistake bro
absolutely the right thing to do it goes
[SPEAKER_01]: on to say she's angry and already sent the
law to my house i turned them away exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: not cool bro i turned them away for lack
of a warrant good job smart move good good
[SPEAKER_01]: move then he goes on to say i tore down
anything green but i have no idea if they
[SPEAKER_01]: will be back they'll be back that's see
that's what i said he goes on to say if
[SPEAKER_01]: hypothetically a grow existed it does not
anymore i am pretty bummed about the loss
[SPEAKER_01]: allegedly but i don't know what to do with
my gear and my genetics then he says what
[SPEAKER_01]: can and should i do with it all i'm wary
of cluing anyone else in to keep my shit
[SPEAKER_01]: for a few months and i'm wondering if some
seeds and a few boxes filled with general
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor growing equipment are enough to
lose sleepover should i find a new home
[SPEAKER_01]: for the equipment and flush the genetics
can i take them out of the fridge and hide
[SPEAKER_01]: them somewhere else for a few months if so
how should i store them then he says
[SPEAKER_01]: thanks bro i really appreciate the advice
just call me the grower who ought to have
[SPEAKER_01]: known better so bro thank you for the
great email you ought to have known better
[SPEAKER_01]: now mike what do you think is the best
plan of action for this guy the first
[SPEAKER_01]: thing i told him was uh stay cool for a
while they're coming like just they coming
[SPEAKER_00]: just keep in mind they'll be back they
coming um if they wasn't gonna come they
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't have come the first time the fact
that they showed up the first time means
[SPEAKER_00]: their plate is empty enough to fill with
your ass um who knows what the ex told
[SPEAKER_00]: them it clearly wasn't anything too over
the top or they would have showed up the
[SPEAKER_00]: first time differently um the fact that
they showed up or told to go away and get
[SPEAKER_00]: a warrant and they left tells me she's
probably just said plants um if you cut
[SPEAKER_00]: down and remove any clear evidence of
cannabis production you should be good to
[SPEAKER_00]: go um if you have all the equipment set up
and seeds in a drawer and grill books on a
[SPEAKER_00]: shelf but no plants under the lights
you're probably still exposed to some
[SPEAKER_00]: criminal penalties depending on where in
prohibition land you are he without
[SPEAKER_01]: revealing too much i've asked questions he
is in a state that has medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: but not any provisions for legal growing
um honestly your best bet is to take
[SPEAKER_00]: it all down and put it all somewhere else
and this is my organic tomatoes and this
[SPEAKER_01]: is my organic celery you guys i don't even
have notes written down and that was going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be option number three for me was to
leave all of the shit up and go hang
[SPEAKER_01]: tomatoes or go put tomatoes under there
and when they come be like yeah man i got
[SPEAKER_01]: a bunch you want some organic tomatoes or
fucking delicious um that's gonna cost you
[SPEAKER_00]: money and time and energy if you're into
homegrown produce like it's a fun option
[SPEAKER_00]: but honestly i'd take i'd pack everything
up and i'd take it to my mama's house
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely my advice again i i predicted
that my advice i knew my advice because i
[SPEAKER_01]: knew that but i told him my advice would
be to get rid of anything organic i told
[SPEAKER_01]: him gear isn't illegal uh books aren't
illegal i told him the seeds may depending
[SPEAKER_01]: on where he is how paranoid he is those
seeds may he may want to do something with
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds can be very very illegal seeds
can be intent to cultivate in certain
[SPEAKER_00]: places i remember picking through stashes
carefully and discarding seeds because
[SPEAKER_00]: people had recently been busted and were
charged with intent to cultivate because
[SPEAKER_00]: they had like a jar that they threw all
their seeds in so those seeds need to go
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere as well the equipment isn't
illegal to have and you bought that
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere it's normal equipment you can
have that as long as you don't have a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plant under that that's just
normal agro light it's just a normal light
[SPEAKER_01]: so my advice was to get rid of all the
organic stuff and consider getting rid of
[SPEAKER_01]: the seeds now i'm adjusting my advice
saying those seeds should go i predicted
[SPEAKER_01]: that your advice would be to get rid of
all the organic and to pack up all the
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment so i knew that mike would take
it that extra step just because that's how
[SPEAKER_01]: mike goes my third piece of advice was
going to be if you really want to fuck
[SPEAKER_01]: with them and you want to have an excuse
as to why your electric bill was high as
[SPEAKER_01]: to why you have all of that gear because
it's been running on where you are there
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what they're doing right now
they're going to pull the electric bill
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah they need stuff for the warrant and
his his angry ex-girlfriend called and
[SPEAKER_00]: said isn't usually enough right and so
they dig through your trash or pull your
[SPEAKER_00]: electric bill and a couple of neighbors
electric bills so that they can show the
[SPEAKER_00]: judge look you know the third house on the
block is drawing you know 10 times the
[SPEAKER_00]: power of any other house on the street
clearly something's amiss plus the
[SPEAKER_00]: girlfriend's statements plus we found
green leafy matter in his trash can right
[SPEAKER_01]: that's enough for your warrant plus when
we knocked on the door we sort of smell
[SPEAKER_01]: the skunky aroma yeah yep so yeah keep
keep thinking that they are going to come
[SPEAKER_01]: back so bottom line get rid of the plants
get rid of organic material get rid of
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-crushed which means seeds get rid of
all of that stuff the second option get
[SPEAKER_01]: rid of the equipment also just get it gone
quickly be discreet about it get it out of
[SPEAKER_01]: there keep an eye on your trash like Mike
just said they're going to go through your
[SPEAKER_01]: trash they're going to watch your electric
bill they're going to pay attention so if
[SPEAKER_01]: you really want to be smooth allegedly one
thing that you could do and we are not
[SPEAKER_01]: recommending any sort of illegal activity
put some fucking tomatoes under those
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and grow yourself some tomatoes
yeah under those lights yeah that's what I
[SPEAKER_00]: meant yeah thanks Mike I mean we said get
rid of there's a lot of steps and get rid
[SPEAKER_00]: of that don't involve your own trash can
right I don't want to advise you on how to
[SPEAKER_00]: destroy the evidence of a potential crime
but your trash can is going to get gone
[SPEAKER_00]: through that's just how it be possibly
already has and will be again like you can
[SPEAKER_00]: pull up videos on YouTube where like cops
raid wrong house and it started because
[SPEAKER_00]: duty left growth store had his license
plate written down six months later when
[SPEAKER_00]: the cop got a free week they ran around
and checked on some of those license
[SPEAKER_00]: plates and just did trash inspections and
they found legit like herbal tea for a
[SPEAKER_00]: head cold in this dude's trash can and him
and his son had like a little veggie lab
[SPEAKER_00]: going in the basement and they ended up
with machine guns pressed to their temples
[SPEAKER_00]: while they were handcuffed on the floor
after their duck their house got flashback
[SPEAKER_00]: and their door exploded like if you
already know the cops are coming to your
[SPEAKER_00]: house your job as a responsible human is
to clean that shit up Mike you're making
[SPEAKER_01]: me paranoid fucking move dude go somewhere
else just pack your stuff up when you can
[SPEAKER_00]: move and start fresh again when you move
it's just not worth your freedom yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: don't even start fresh in the next place
you have to move somewhere until until you
[SPEAKER_01]: get cleaned up until they forget and then
go to another place if you think you're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna start again you have to skip a spot
I don't know about that cops have pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: full plates everywhere like right now
they've got a name and address as soon as
[SPEAKER_00]: those two pieces of information are in
separate places like if you move to a new
[SPEAKER_00]: place you're you're pretty good to go I
think it was the cops I was still worried
[SPEAKER_01]: about Mike I like how you just kind of
like the bar like you were trying not to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about how ugly my dreadlocks were but
then you took a shot and it just came out
[SPEAKER_01]: this fucking guy's got the ugliest fucking
hair over here don't know what's going on
[SPEAKER_00]: like seriously think about the 15 or 20
people we've known over the years that
[SPEAKER_00]: have really had a garden just vanish get
destroyed get them in a bunch of trouble
[SPEAKER_00]: in almost every instance it was a
disgruntled employee or girlfriend yep in
[SPEAKER_00]: in almost every instance yeah it's almost
never the cops showed up on an anonymous
[SPEAKER_00]: tip from a complete stranger who happened
to smell it walking by like our local
[SPEAKER_00]: sheriff had to do a big PR stunt with a
bunch of antipod locals to get that shit
[SPEAKER_00]: to happen in the rest of the world that
don't happen very often it's almost always
[SPEAKER_00]: a disgruntled ex-girlfriend or a buddy you
showed that just got in some different
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble that wants out it's that's why you
shut up and don't tell anybody about your
[SPEAKER_00]: growing prohibition land there you go it's
part of the reason the Colorado and
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington Oregon California kids gets
went so nuts talking about our garden and
[SPEAKER_00]: posting pics for a while because we
weren't allowed to for so long like that's
[SPEAKER_00]: when I really understood the whole point
behind like the super flamboyant gay pride
[SPEAKER_00]: parade like as soon as I was finally
allowed to be open in public about some
[SPEAKER_00]: shit that I was totally not allowed to be
open in public before I was like oh now I
[SPEAKER_00]: get the fucking glitter overalls it makes
sense now Mike thank you I needed that
[SPEAKER_01]: lesson in life right there I did not do I
did not do it didn't get mad it didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: connect in my head and get it now that big
glitter bomb was just fucking held so
[SPEAKER_01]: tight and that big glitter bomb fucking
exploded and came out like it did I get it
[SPEAKER_00]: now we saw it here like we voted in 2012
to make it legal an hour later social
[SPEAKER_00]: media exploded with garden picks very true
is this is legal now I can't accidentally
[SPEAKER_00]: ruin my life for social with a social
media post of a plant it's just a picture
[SPEAKER_00]: I took of a room with plants in it like if
there's not a dead body in the picture you
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't be able to get in a bunch of
trouble for it but pictures of plants
[SPEAKER_00]: could get you in a fuckload of trouble
before and they don't now very true and
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah Mike I'm still blown away how you've
opened my mind to it's it it really made
[SPEAKER_01]: sense to me it's no it makes perfect sense
and I never thought of it like that and my
[SPEAKER_00]: mind needed that lesson and you see social
media with it like there's there's memes
[SPEAKER_00]: and jokes about it is like the my state
legalized weed starter pack or the I trim
[SPEAKER_00]: a pound in three days starter pack like
there's a bunch of units because we went
[SPEAKER_00]: ape shit for a long time with it yeah we
still are going ape shit with it it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: fun to brag like we feel bad doing it
sometimes because we know y'all out in
[SPEAKER_00]: Prohibition land don't have what we have
here we want you to have what we have here
[SPEAKER_00]: we just want you to make it legal in your
area right oh yeah we're full here we are
[SPEAKER_00]: what's the fuck Hawaii it's full here
we're talking about screwing shit up let's
[SPEAKER_01]: get that I love it when I'm in in Denver
at a comedy show or somewhere and somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: sees my I read genetics Colorado shirt
they're like oh what do you do you from
[SPEAKER_01]: here and I'm like I run a grove I do grow
stuff weed stuff and they're just like oh
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah it triggers so much conversation they
just have so many questions and I love it
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the out-of-staters that want to
just talk about cannabis all day long I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know why I have an alarm going off
right now but that was very unprofessional
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast which piece of equipment needs to
be checked thanks I remember now I
[SPEAKER_01]: remember it's exactly a piece of equipment
and something that needs to be turned off
[SPEAKER_01]: I did hit snooze we'll turn it off at the
end of the show not a great big deal shout
[SPEAKER_01]: out to alarms for reminding us not to
destroy our gardens what up technology how
[SPEAKER_00]: you doing yeah so a quick reminder for the
listeners don't tell anybody about your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow nobody even if it's an illegal state
you should probably shut up about it yes
[SPEAKER_01]: people still want to steal it people still
want to be vindictive people still are
[SPEAKER_01]: haters I don't know what's wrong with
society these days but no matter how well
[SPEAKER_01]: you do how hard you try someone is gonna
hate you for it exes always want to fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: your shit up if you were selling hats and
kitten posters they'd be telling their
[SPEAKER_00]: friends that your shits terrible yeah like
they just want to bring you down if you if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a cannabis grow it's just easier for
them very true and I can't tell you how
[SPEAKER_00]: many gardens I've seen or helped people
move from one place to another in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of the night because they just
broke up with so and so allegedly they
[SPEAKER_00]: threatened to so and so allegedly yeah all
of this is a long fucking time ago fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: bring it if you could still find my
footprints in that mud behind that house
[SPEAKER_01]: in the dark where we moved that light
right bring it one of my favorite memories
[SPEAKER_01]: of legal cannabis we were trimming an
outdoor grow at a friend's house and
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple police officers came up through
the back gate area because he lived his
[SPEAKER_01]: back gate had an alley and then it was the
back gate multiple law enforcement
[SPEAKER_01]: officers came up casually walking up and
they there was a crime that had happened
[SPEAKER_01]: in the area and they're like hey do you
guys see this person and we're like I know
[SPEAKER_01]: him haven't seen him and like okay and
then they said you guys have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis here and I said I've got a
medical marijuana card and the cop slowly
[SPEAKER_01]: turned his head from person to person just
like you yeah I got a cannabis card too
[SPEAKER_01]: you yeah card you yeah card and this is
before recreational this is all medical we
[SPEAKER_00]: got lucky they were looking for a serious
felon and we were at a point where the
[SPEAKER_00]: cops knew that checking our paperwork
would take a very long time of their day
[SPEAKER_01]: there were probably eight to ten of us out
there just trimming sitting on picnic
[SPEAKER_00]: tables in the backyard the warrant squad
had wandered up the alley and noticed that
[SPEAKER_00]: a half dozen people were trimming weed in
the backyard Buddy's wife was out there
[SPEAKER_01]: she was cooking food in the backyard he
was out there entertaining us yeah the
[SPEAKER_01]: dogs are running around and here come law
enforcement officers just like hey guys
[SPEAKER_01]: did you happen to see this person or like
oh that's that's a neighborhood guy we
[SPEAKER_01]: know who he is now he didn't come through
here and they're like okay um who's got a
[SPEAKER_01]: medical marijuana card and I was like I've
got a medical marijuana card and he just
[SPEAKER_01]: went around the circle and they kind of
looked at you're like well they've got
[SPEAKER_01]: cards have a good day guys and they left
us alone they never came back they never
[SPEAKER_01]: bugged us but that was a summer outdoor
medical harvest that was before the rules
[SPEAKER_01]: were so gray that it was more of a pain in
the ass to come bust us because then you'd
[SPEAKER_01]: go to court they'd go well what rule did
they break they have medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: plants they'd go we don't know but they
have weed plants it's got to be illegal
[SPEAKER_01]: and there was just no clear line at that
point so there was a lot of fun when it
[SPEAKER_01]: was all gray area yeah if you're in one of
those gray area wild wild west is what we
[SPEAKER_01]: called it get it on while you get it while
you can because it will not last forever
[SPEAKER_01]: so first it comes the start of
normalization legalization regulation is
[SPEAKER_01]: what I'm thinking of that comes then it
then it tightens up and then it tightens
[SPEAKER_00]: up and it tightens up if you if you're in
a state where it's just kicking on and you
[SPEAKER_00]: get an early start socking money away for
equipment changeovers and regulation
[SPEAKER_00]: changes the cost you random money out of
nowhere absolutely I remember the edible
[SPEAKER_00]: companies here freaked when everything had
to be stamped this every edible company
[SPEAKER_00]: had to buy all new molds like overnight
this is a real thing be ready for it be
[SPEAKER_01]: prepared for the future be ready all right
