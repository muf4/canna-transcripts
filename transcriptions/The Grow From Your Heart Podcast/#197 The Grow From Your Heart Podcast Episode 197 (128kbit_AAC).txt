and techniques may have changed.

now.

differently.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully, we have all learned a lot of
things since then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stuff may be different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't hold it against me if I have
different ideas and techniques now than I
[SPEAKER_03]: did then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, all of the social media has changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of the I Grow Culture stuff,
it's gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't answer any of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't read that.

The Movement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight we have Kevin and Adam over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Kevin looks like he's having a seizure
while he's trying to dance.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's some funny shit to watch.
[SPEAKER_03]: I looked up from the recording equipment
and- I'm white.
[SPEAKER_03]: What can I say?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you're doing the Humpty dance.
[SPEAKER_03]: This might have been what that was.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was getting there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You look like MC Hammer on Crack Humpty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to catch my breath from some dads we
took, but we're going to have a great 25th
[SPEAKER_03]: episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you guys, man?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pumped, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad to be here for 25.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just showed up, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for getting here right on time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm running a little late.
[SPEAKER_04]: Things are pretty crazy at the hut.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gave Kevin and I some time to take some
dads and hang out.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the hut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you call it the hut?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the hut.
The hut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not sure how's the hut, but the actual
hut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jabba owns it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jabba owns that hut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Word.
[SPEAKER_03]: So also I should mention that we've got
the email set up next to us on the Eric
[SPEAKER_03]: Ross 4.0 rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: So say hello to the email, ladies and
gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the email talking back to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be doing a lot of work tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm better.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like we're doing good.
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened to the music?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's responsible for that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, but I think you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it comes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming again.
Watch.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the music.
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a real fly in the background.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we'll just do it that one time.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, man, thanks for coming, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's episode 25.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted you guys here because Spence and
Jesse are hard to get here, or they would
[SPEAKER_03]: have been here too.
[SPEAKER_03]: But of course at this time of night,
they're not coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're the second choice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate the invite regardless.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love coming over.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that I'm all high and you guys want
to turn that and make me sound like a
[SPEAKER_03]: dick.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I wanted all four of you here.
All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted all four of you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would have been dope.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would have been loud, but it would
have been fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it would have been a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would have had to get more chairs out,
more microphones.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would have been pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: But imagine that party.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably one other dab rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's like one in the morning,
you guys that are listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one in the morning on Friday night.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my fault.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we all had shit to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kev's got a life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you had to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Life-ish.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things weren't my second choices.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got me feeling bad and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, you're good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeez.
[SPEAKER_03]: We love you, Brandon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Giving you shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make me cry on the 25th episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: So last night, Adam and myself and another
friend went to a comedy show, ComedyWorks
[SPEAKER_03]: in Denver.
[SPEAKER_03]: We saw a comedian called Todd Johnson.
[SPEAKER_03]: Called Todd Johnson.
[SPEAKER_03]: I sound like an Asian guy when you say it
that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy called Todd Johnson.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw the comedian named Todd Johnson.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was pretty funny, but I thought he was
kind of clean for my taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was kind of good old boy comedy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said nasty on the ride there,
so I was really expecting dirty.
[SPEAKER_03]: So ComedyWorks is hooking me up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've gone to a lot of ComedyWorks shows.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they see my email address on a lot of
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they called me and they're like,
we'll give you free tickets to a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: shows, or you can get $5 tickets to a
bunch of other shows.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they do it just to fill the seats is
what they're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I see why now that we got there,
why that comedy show was $5.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I told them next time, give me
somebody dirty.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I want something dirty or a
little filthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: The opening act, there was a host who I
always forget his name.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Ron something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel bad that I forget his name.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a comedian well known for doing
dance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dabs, dab jokes, weed jokes.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a good host.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's getting better at being a host.
[SPEAKER_13]: Is he like in a comedy group?
[SPEAKER_03]: He used to be, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a short dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to call you short, bro, but I'm six
five.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's fucking short to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll look him up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll Google him when we take a dab break.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was his name again?
[SPEAKER_03]: Ron was his first name.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a real friendly looking, but he's a
comedian, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anything I say to describe him,
he's a real friendly looking dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's short.
[SPEAKER_13]: I would like to know if he was one of the
guys I saw at Phil's one night,
[SPEAKER_13]: because there were two comedians that came
down from Denver that were fucking
[SPEAKER_13]: hilarious and did some awesome dab jokes
and shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: Could have been this guy.
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually tipped him with some goodies
because of the jokes that they made.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some goodies, I like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're the only two comedians that did
that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, following up, that guy was the host.
[SPEAKER_03]: Following him was a guy named Deacon Grey,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was there a comedian before Deacon Grey?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Deacon, oh no, because it seemed like the
host kind of did it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The host did a five minute set.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Deacon Grey came out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you guys don't know Deacon Grey,
Deacon Grey is a Denver local,
[SPEAKER_03]: as far as I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's funny as shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hilarious.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's kind of an older dude and he's had
time to calm down.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not a hyper kid and he's got his
delivery is flawless.
[SPEAKER_03]: He doesn't look like he's up there
performing.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's up there having as much fun as we
are.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he did quite a bit of high humor too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, that's not easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it seems easy to write jokes about
pot, but you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has to be, in Denver now,
there's a thing where everybody's a pot
[SPEAKER_03]: comic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can't be a pot comic.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to have that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can throw in your pot set for when the
crowd is there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't rely on that because it gets old
quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't about pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was more about the high humor,
you know, about being high kind of than it
[SPEAKER_03]: was about like, I get my weed for cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Deacon Grey.
[SPEAKER_03]: I recommend that dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check him out.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can see him, go see him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: He might have a website or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't do any research on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also a big shout out to Melissa from
ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_03]: She probably does not have any clue about
this podcast, but she made it listen.
[SPEAKER_03]: She should listen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell her next time I talk to her on
the phone, I'll be like, you should listen
[SPEAKER_03]: to my show.
[SPEAKER_03]: But she hooked it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: She made it all worth it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be catching Joe Rogan at ComedyWorks
next week.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll let you guys know how that goes
on the next episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm coughing it up over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been taking dabs, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse my little miniature pauses.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is not me dying at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also kind of cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: I left the air on until fucking like
midnight and it got like 64 degrees in
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was chilly in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been used to it being like 85,
90.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I walked up here and it was 60,
64, not a shivering.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, random talk on the show,
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So before we get too far, this is a
celebration show, but we have something
[SPEAKER_03]: really awesome to add to this celebration.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited to announce that Mark Emery is
home in Canada with his wife, Jody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys follow the show, you know that
Mark Emery was arrested and held in an
[SPEAKER_03]: American federal prison for distributing
cannabis seeds across the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most listeners of the show would agree
that Mark was in prison for complete
[SPEAKER_03]: bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's great to know that he's
back home with his family where he
[SPEAKER_03]: belongs.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's cuddled up with his wife.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw a picture of him smoking a joint
with some people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw a picture of him hugging up on his
wife.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what a man should be doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You shouldn't be locked up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's right back on the phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: The fight, I don't know if you've watched
any video of, he's right up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I never really noticed that he spoke
with a wisp.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe he has a retainer or something,
but it really was pronounced when he,
[SPEAKER_04]: like when he very first stepped back into
Canada and got in front of the microphone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can, I can link you to the video.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always remember him going on and on for
days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, that's something that I never
really noticed, but he's right back on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And his wife's running for liberal,
uh, liberal, some kind of liberal office
[SPEAKER_04]: up there for their stuff to fight the
power.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good, good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good to see him back on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: So big love and much respect to Mark and
Jody Emory.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did a little bit of a checking it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark was taken into federal prison on
September 10th, 2010.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was released July 9th, 2014.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used Siri.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say I used a calculator.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just asked Siri, how many days was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's 1,398 days in federal prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus the time he was locked up while
awaiting trial, the time during the trial
[SPEAKER_03]: and a couple of weeks in limbo after he
was released from federal prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: 1,398 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Adam, you look speechless.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you familiar with that sort of time
period?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a long, long time, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a long time, dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: I am going to sound retarded here,
but I did three and then 54 and I felt
[SPEAKER_13]: like it was fucking hell.
[SPEAKER_13]: Three days and 54 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a little tiny dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's some fucking courage and some bad
assness in that dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: So good job, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's kind of what I was going to
ask is now that he's, he was the principal
[SPEAKER_04]: before he came in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does he knock Aryan off his King throne?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you ain't done a lick.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not touching that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's close to four years though in
federal prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's 46 months, 200 weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So imagine your life being disrupted for
200 weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: He'd be a totally different person.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said he'd spend his time well.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he said he'd learned like the
bass guitar and he did a lot of reading.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: So learning the bass in prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: Mine was in county jail, not federal
prison.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's a whole nother level even.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm glad he's free.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was locked up on, in our opinion,
bullshit charges.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bullshit charges.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes every seed breeder, pot grower,
makes us all a little bit kind of,
[SPEAKER_04]: and not only that, but he was worried
about ourselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before the rules have changed and now that
they've changed, you know, I can just
[SPEAKER_04]: imagine the culture shock.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, from where he was Mark Emmer,
where he could probably puff on the street
[SPEAKER_03]: anytime he wanted to.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now in Canada, they don't really seem
to care from what people have told me.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, come here and smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't really, they got bigger problems
to fry.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't talk about it like we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't get all hyped about it,
but they also don't give a shit about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So big shout out to Mark Emmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys are long time listeners,
you know that we actually did,
[SPEAKER_03]: we used to do a portion of the show called
Give Thanks, which I will do again in the
[SPEAKER_03]: future, but we've been packing the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been like an hour and 15 minutes
sometimes, and I don't feel like we need
[SPEAKER_03]: to stretch it out with another Give Thanks
portion once we're that long.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, welcome home, Mark Emmery.
[SPEAKER_03]: Much love to Jodie Emmery for being strong
and keeping herself active in the movement
[SPEAKER_03]: while we were down one soldier.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where'd the music go?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just real quiet.
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Task Rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, Task?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I need to take one second to make an
important, make an, I'm fucking high and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuttering.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's try that in English, in English this
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to make an important announcement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, I did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the contests we have started on the
show will be ending soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I left a few contests open-ended and I've
been waiting for answers to a few
[SPEAKER_03]: questions and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think those episodes have gotten old and
the giveaways have just faded away.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to reuse the prizes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll end all of the contests that are
happening now on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to make an official ending
date on those contests so that when I do
[SPEAKER_03]: reuse those prizes, nobody can get mad if
they try to go win the old contests.
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Official shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do have a Jenny Kush pin and a couple
other pins and things that I tried to use
[SPEAKER_03]: in contests before.
[SPEAKER_03]: There'll be a Jenny Kush pin available
pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to check the little box.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got some prizes set aside.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to put them back in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pins are cool, giveaways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Giveaways?
[SPEAKER_03]: Giveaways.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're as high as me, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not, honestly.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get you a couple of dabs if you're
saying you're not as high as- No,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're good.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's cool, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're on a podcast where we need to- I
don't need to speak well, you know what
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's a podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't look good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: For all you ladies and gentlemen that were
hoping to see me, he's told you where to
[SPEAKER_04]: find me and look at my ugly mug before,
so.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the- Go ahead and dab that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's some turpex right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to the turpex boys, Jordan and
Jordan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also big shout out to the Grimy Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep running, Hunt.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see you do six miles every
morning without fucking getting winded.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, my buddy Hunt has quit eating meat,
eats fish still.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's cut out.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's addicted to soda and he's cut out 23,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Dr. Pepper, he's cut it out of his
life.
[SPEAKER_03]: So give him some strength for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Word.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just for exercising.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I cut out Mountain Dew.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to be strongly addicted to Mountain
Dew and I cut that out of my diet and my
[SPEAKER_03]: body feels better.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want another one?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, I'm good for a second,
but that was tasty.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to take this one right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to dab here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're handing them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're handing out dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how we do it here on the
agriculture podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a smoker and that was smooth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you guys are crazy that smoke
cigarettes and still take- are able to
[SPEAKER_03]: take dabs and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brother, I'm trying to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's killing me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you've got a nice outdoor harvest
coming up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you should just roll a bunch of- you
should get some tobacco, like some fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: pouch tobacco.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't mix it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then just roll some joints and well,
then you'll get your nicotine fit that
[SPEAKER_03]: way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just slowly take the nicotine
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can- like I said, I've done the jail
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can just quit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: My problem is her smoking next to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we both have to quit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's not that strong-willed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's- She doesn't want to quit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then she won't quit.
[SPEAKER_04]: She doesn't want to.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm trying to- I've told her,
get a pin and just smoke wax.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like you don't- Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got a little pin, pulls it out of
nowhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the- you want to say what kind of
brand it is?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I don't know if you want to shout it
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they give him that product to test
out and he doesn't really have a platform
[SPEAKER_03]: to give a review.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're tied up in the headphone cable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're going to be stuck for life now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But go ahead and go ahead and tell him the
name of the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I hit it once.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Neos.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll shut up so you can talk.
[SPEAKER_13]: The company is Neos.
[SPEAKER_13]: In my opinion, it's an easier draw and
better tasting and more effective than
[SPEAKER_13]: some of the other companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's an interesting piece.
[SPEAKER_13]: They gave us some samples to try out to
see if, you know, we wanted to carry their
[SPEAKER_13]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're a fairly new company.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're just trying to get their name
out there pretty much.
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of that's going down right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: The battery's a little bit bigger than
some of the other companies that are a
[SPEAKER_13]: similar style.
[SPEAKER_13]: So they have strain specific cartridges.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's CO2 oil.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if you mentioned that yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good product.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not- It looks really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pro level.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not dab kit dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're looking for a vape pen like
this, it's really attractive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that- Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you just replace the cartridge on the
end.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: I see it now.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was looking for the unscrew part,
but you had your finger right there and I
[SPEAKER_13]: could tell.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a USB that attaches to the other
end.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the very end of it is a stylus.
[SPEAKER_13]: What does that cost?
[SPEAKER_03]: If I were a rec patient, what would that
cost me?
[SPEAKER_13]: We haven't started carrying them yet.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm not sure, but similar companies
with smaller batteries, like I said,
[SPEAKER_13]: that aren't as great.
[SPEAKER_13]: A starter package is about $58 and some
change.
[SPEAKER_13]: For a small cartridge, just a 150
milligram cartridge and a battery.
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't have to replace the battery.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can recharge it.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you just have to come get cartridges
and they make them in three different
[SPEAKER_13]: sizes.
[SPEAKER_13]: But these ones that were- these new ones
that we're testing out, we're probably
[SPEAKER_13]: going to start carrying those.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm not sure what the price will be on
those.
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll be similar, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a cool little- It's a cool little
piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long has it been different high?
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed a different high from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been dabbing for a while and I just
took another rip off that and my high
[SPEAKER_03]: changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It got me a little different.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a cool product.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's lemon diesel, this particular
cartridge.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to take a dab of some Turbex,
of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might have friends that are Turbex.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something may have hooked me up with some
hash there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone might have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Turbex is a badass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jordan, Jordan, Grammy Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are more of the guys, but those are
the guys I kick with mostly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to take this dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody talk for me for a couple of
seconds.
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, it's definitely a very attractive
case and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, why not get something like that
and fill it full?
[SPEAKER_04]: Of wax that she'll hit maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: She probably won't clear the damn thing in
a week.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would last your wife a week.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that would last a while, dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those cartridges- I can't say if it will
or not, but it's very, it's smooth pull.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to push a button.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's simple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, you wear it with a black
shirt.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You haven't- All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was enough of a free shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a message on Facebook from a
listener named Fred.
[SPEAKER_03]: And ironically, he was asking me to talk
about acquiring seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really great because this email
came today while I was preparing for the
[SPEAKER_03]: show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse my cough guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's from dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's from big dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to talk about acquiring seeds,
but before I do that, let me give a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit of a legal disclaimer because we don't
want to be the next Mark Emmerich.
[SPEAKER_03]: It may be illegal to acquire cannabis
seeds in your location.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is your responsibility to know the laws
in your location.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any company online that will send you
seeds is only sending them to you for
[SPEAKER_03]: souvenir purposes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Germinating cannabis seeds is illegal in
most places.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not here to help you break the law.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you decide to buy and or germinate
cannabis seeds, I cannot be responsible
[SPEAKER_03]: for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I live in Colorado where cannabis is
legalized.
[SPEAKER_03]: So most of my advice is for Colorado,
California, Oregon, Washington,
[SPEAKER_03]: or Michigan residents.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be careful and don't get your ass into
trouble because I'm not a lawyer and I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: not responsible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm simply the host of a bad-ass podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a cool fucking disclaimer,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just had to do that because I don't,
I don't guys, if you're ordering seeds,
[SPEAKER_03]: you must be 18 or 21 and you got to be
responsible.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to be smart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Know the rules where you are in your
location.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they might've used, that's not
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Know the rules in your location.
[SPEAKER_03]: Use poor grammar, but still do that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now with all that being said,
here's what I can tell you about acquiring
[SPEAKER_03]: yourself some seeds, yourself,
acquiring some seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like quality seeds from reputable
breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys want to rant on breeders for a
minute?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who are some of your favorites?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know who you're going to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Say whoever you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've only heard of a few,
you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: TGA has definitely got the respect and
rare dankness.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Rare dankness is definitely great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I respect both of those guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, you know, iogenetics,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they'll be mentioned in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's me, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't have to pause.
Whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're already here getting dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just going to put it out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kelly connection.
[SPEAKER_13]: Who are you thinking?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm honestly a fan.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm honestly a fan of a lot of the new
seed breeders coming out.
[SPEAKER_13]: The new guys?
[SPEAKER_13]: Not to take any, anything away from some
of the old guys who've really paved the
[SPEAKER_13]: way and helped a lot of the new seed
breeders get good genetics to breed with.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you can't take anything away from those
guys, but I mean, some of the iogenetics,
[SPEAKER_13]: Laplata Labs, Gage Green Genetics,
like they're all doing some really awesome
[SPEAKER_13]: stuff and they're thinking about what
they're crossing and what they're trying
[SPEAKER_13]: to get out of their crosses and not just
finding a good phenotype.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're actually looking for flavor
profiles and cannabinoid profiles and
[SPEAKER_13]: they're getting what they want out of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And a lot of that has to do with the way
they do things.
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of the new seed breeders are really
community friendly and dispersing a lot of
[SPEAKER_13]: seeds to a lot of people and allowing them
to perform their methods of growing and
[SPEAKER_13]: find, you know, different, there's an
occasional There's an occasional secret
[SPEAKER_03]: meeting at a place in Denver where a few
of us are chosen to meet at this mansion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to the King of Quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mile High Seeds?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mile High is there, Laplata Labs is there,
Sin City goes, Alpha Chronic shows up,
[SPEAKER_03]: a bunch of us breeders, iogenetics goes,
and we all take packages of our newest
[SPEAKER_03]: shit or whatever, our secret weapon,
and we trade.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like Mile High has given me his Apollo
Times Brothers Haze and I gave him my
[SPEAKER_03]: grateful dog, you know, like just trade
packs of seeds around the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we all, yeah, we try to keep it
together with each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of trying to compete, we're trying
to be like, well, here, bro, here's some
[SPEAKER_03]: face off OG for some heart of gold,
you know, like barter, trade, that you
[SPEAKER_03]: don't need a bank account.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a few of our favorite breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: Buy some seeds from reputable breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am iogenetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say since it's hard to get
iogenetics, seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gage Green is one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_03]: I use Gage Green for breeding stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to get into a breeding stuff
and you want a reliable male, I can't
[SPEAKER_03]: believe I'm fucking telling the world
this, but Gage Green is a good place to
[SPEAKER_03]: find a nice reliable male.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true shit right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how friendly I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: But be careful with your breeding because
you can still fuck up even with that good
[SPEAKER_03]: male.
[SPEAKER_03]: So much I like you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: You listen to my show, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So bag seeds are fun, but they're not as
reliable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bag seeds are seeds that you find in weed,
of course, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not as reliable as something you'd
find.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want something with a specific pair of
spread for certain traits like Kevin was
[SPEAKER_03]: saying earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of cool that he touched on
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your first option is bag seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's shit that you of course found in
that kush that you bought from that guy in
[SPEAKER_03]: the park and it had a seed in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grow that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: See what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: But keep a close eye on any bag seed
because it could be a male or it could be
[SPEAKER_03]: a hermaphrodite.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Adam's got a yard of herms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're in a legal state,
you can possibly get seeds at a dispensary
[SPEAKER_03]: or a co-op.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of the shops in California,
Colorado, Washington, and Michigan have
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds from reputable breeders available on
the shelves and the dispensaries almost
[SPEAKER_03]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Pacific Northwest has fucking TGA
sub cool seeds all over the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the shops in Colorado,
you can pick up yourself some rare
[SPEAKER_03]: dankness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Michigan's got, oddly enough, they've got
Gage Green genetics because our friend
[SPEAKER_03]: Yankee trolls up and down the East coast
there and takes care of them with the Gage
[SPEAKER_03]: Green.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's Gage Green rep and he's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're taken care of.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are seeds on shops and shelves.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was reading, I forgot.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also pick up seeds at cannabis
events like the Cannabis Cup and Hemfest
[SPEAKER_03]: or whatever else is happening this month
because there seems to be an event every
[SPEAKER_03]: damn month now.
[SPEAKER_03]: The breeders go, they set up a tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do a little bit of research online.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find out what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find out what you should be paying.
[SPEAKER_03]: They expect to pay about a hundred bucks
for a 10 pack of seeds, honestly,
[SPEAKER_03]: between 60 and 120, but about a hundred
bucks for a 10 pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So before you go to the events,
go and find out what you want and then go
[SPEAKER_03]: there and see if you can find those
breeders and you'll have a little shopping
[SPEAKER_03]: done.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be a little easier for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But those are only viable options if you
live in or if you can travel to a legal
[SPEAKER_03]: state like Colorado or to Hemfest,
which is happening right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be over by the time you hear this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: That may not be an option.
[SPEAKER_03]: For most of you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in this case, you're going to need to
order your seeds online.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're in the United States,
I strongly recommend nature's green
[SPEAKER_03]: remedies.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: My company has a great working
relationship with nature's green remedies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm friends with most of the breeders
stocked on nature's green remedies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I trust everyone that I've done
business with involved with nature's green
[SPEAKER_03]: remedies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I strongly recommend nature's green
remedies.com for seeds in the U S.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, expect to pay around a
hundred dollars for a 10 pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you get a 12 pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some brands are a little cheaper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some are slightly higher.
[SPEAKER_03]: Feminine seeds often run a little more
expensive because they're harder to
[SPEAKER_03]: produce.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get way less Feminine seeds out of a
breeding project than you do regular
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes more time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes more space.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes more energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So of course we want more money for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not charge my regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: My Feminine seeds are the same price.
[SPEAKER_03]: I charge the same price all the way
around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nature's green remedies uses discrete.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's discrete.
[SPEAKER_03]: That means they don't write.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are seeds on the package.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nature's green remedies uses discrete
priority shipping.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're right here in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, your seeds will arrive in
just a few short days.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have to pass through customs
and get held up.
[SPEAKER_03]: They take all kinds of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: America, right here in America.

[SPEAKER_03]: Dab the fuck out and I'm on the spot,
so it's time to take a celebration dab
[SPEAKER_03]: because episode 25 is going well.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the shout outs done.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the commercials done.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the contest out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel good after giving all those people
a shout out on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_13]: That covers most everyone.
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to give one special shout out to
fucking toughest dude I know, Pops,
[SPEAKER_13]: man.
[SPEAKER_13]: He fucking is beating shit and it's
awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought he might show up here tonight
for the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't sure, but yeah, big shout out to
Pops.
[SPEAKER_03]: A big shout out to Jofferton, Kara Pops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pops was really battling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we say what Pops was working with?
[SPEAKER_03]: Pops had lung cancer and he looked like
hell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pops looked like a skeleton several months
ago and with the little treatments from
[SPEAKER_03]: his doctor, not little treatments,
fucking big ass treatments from his doctor
[SPEAKER_03]: that almost plowed the shit out of Pops
and the love from Kevin and the nurturing
[SPEAKER_03]: from Kevin and also the help of cannabis,
Pops looks like a freaking million bucks
[SPEAKER_03]: now, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: The help from Jeff and Irie and the whole
cannabis community, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: There were a lot of people that gave free
donations just to help out his cause
[SPEAKER_13]: because he couldn't smoke anymore and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it's about.
[SPEAKER_13]: He gained weight throughout his entire
treatment.
[SPEAKER_13]: The only bad news we received was the
original cancer.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cannabis has done a lot for the man.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's made sure he could eat and kept him
going through all those hard treatments.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're just waiting on the scan next month
to see what the final answer is,
[SPEAKER_13]: but he says he has more energy.
[SPEAKER_13]: He feels better than he has in over three
years.
[SPEAKER_13]: He looks better.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: Take care of yourselves, guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have to thank the community for that
because very little came from me,
[SPEAKER_13]: to be quite honest.
[SPEAKER_13]: I bought what I could, but I was limited
as well and I got a lot of free things
[SPEAKER_13]: from a lot of good people and I appreciate
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what this community is for.
[SPEAKER_03]: As growers and breeders, if you're doing
it right, you do okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to pay it forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to kick it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope you guys notice that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: We try not to be stingy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've only been here a couple of months and
let me just say that it's one thing
[SPEAKER_04]: hearing about it from internet and other
sources and things like that, but seeing
[SPEAKER_04]: it for yourself, it's great, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: What he's speaking is the truth out here.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have to give a huge thanks to Joey from
Natural Mystic Caregivers and Selecta
[SPEAKER_13]: Nicotibol.
[SPEAKER_13]: They fucking hooked it up with oil
capsules that went directly to him.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've heard a lot of good things about
those.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't pay me to say this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have paid sponsors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Essential capsules didn't pay anything.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've heard a lot of good things about
those.
[SPEAKER_13]: The Mystic capsules from Joey,
I ran into him just leaving, actually.
[SPEAKER_13]: I ran into him right in the middle of two
places and I kind of told him how I was
[SPEAKER_13]: doing and he asked about my dad because he
had met him before.
[SPEAKER_13]: I told him and he reached in his bag and
gave me some of those Mystic capsules that
[SPEAKER_13]: won the Cannabis Cup Award.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been amazing the love and support
I've gotten from everybody and the love
[SPEAKER_13]: that's gone to him.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: The community really works like that,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you show it love, it does.
[SPEAKER_04]: It gives you love back.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had another friend, I don't know if he
wants me to shout him out on a podcast,
[SPEAKER_03]: but a friend of a friend came down with
stage four liver cancer and it was in deep
[SPEAKER_03]: shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually looked worse than Pops looked.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying to level any shit,
but the only thing that was going to work
[SPEAKER_03]: for this cat was RSO.
[SPEAKER_03]: I posted on Facebook, I need some RSO and
I got it within five days.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It delivered from Leadville.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like eight or nine hours away from
here to just a friend of a friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's compassionate care right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They knew it wasn't for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: They knew that that was for that guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't asking for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, yeah, we got it,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hooked him up.
[SPEAKER_03]: If anybody out there, this shout out is
for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you hook up medical patients,
if you don't charge your medical patients,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you give medical patients extra,
I know you got to recoup your light fees.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to pay for your soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to do that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Charge them the bare minimum.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys are hooking up cancer patients
with RSO, if you're doing that kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: shit, you know who you are if you deserve
a shout out for this shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big ups.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a medical provider, big love,
respect, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a shout out for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys don't get enough attention paid
to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't get enough love.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of you guys are just balling out
looking like gangsters living off the
[SPEAKER_03]: caregiver life, but some of you guys are
doing it proper and mad love for that
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's hard to do it proper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Growing that medical grade herb with no
sprays, no crazy shit on it is definitely
[SPEAKER_03]: a challenge.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's crazy stuff, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to keep the grow lessons coming and
shit and I always do episodes with news.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys want to hear me talk about
something, something random, something
[SPEAKER_03]: like this guy, the whole seed topic today
just happened to be good timing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a giveaway planned and that guy
asked about where to get seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now hopefully he's listening to episode
25 and he can get seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: He doesn't even have to buy some irie
genetics products right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think his email said he's in California,
so he's cool to grow herb.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got that 215 and it's legal out
there, but he doesn't have to even buy
[SPEAKER_03]: irie genetics products.
[SPEAKER_03]: He can go buy some rare dankness or some
Laplata, some Durango OG, if they've got
[SPEAKER_03]: that shit in stock.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: That alien, lemon alien?
[SPEAKER_03]: Lemon alien?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if that's available anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's available,
but it looks ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or engaged green genetics, Scarlett Cush
or Scarlett Cush or Asperer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying not to call.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm better now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should have just let it happen,
but go get some of those and then use that
[SPEAKER_03]: coupon code episode 25.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all one word, capital E and then the
number 25, episode 25.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get a free five pack of irie gear and
I don't want anything except your loyal
[SPEAKER_03]: listenership, which is pretty awesome.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to hear me talk about some
shit, just tweet me, message me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll talk about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll discuss it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk about it on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wondered what I was doing with the
recording gear.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew that part.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where am I?
[SPEAKER_03]: I missed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I lost my fucking… Somebody point to this
paper and I'll just start reading there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not really sure where you were on that
paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you can message me at iGrowCulture
on hotmail.com or you can tweet me at
[SPEAKER_03]: iGrowCulture or you can find me on
Facebook under iGrowCulture.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't want me to say your name on
the show, just let me know in your message
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'll keep your identity private.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that I got to keep some people on
Texas and Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't let anybody know they're growing and
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I won't bust you out.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you leave a comment on iTunes or
Stitcher, I'll try to read those on a
[SPEAKER_03]: future episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to Task Rock for the song,
it's playing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a couple minutes to kill.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys got a topic you want to bring up?
[SPEAKER_03]: You had a couple topics earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado Springs has banned the use of
butane extraction.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to celebrate the banning of
butane extraction by taking a fat chunky
[SPEAKER_03]: dad?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what you're going to do?
[SPEAKER_13]: I asked, honestly.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: Go for your thing, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's not a lot of details on it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll turn Adam's mic off.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's not a lot to say about it.
[SPEAKER_13]: However, for those who haven't caught the
message yet, Colorado Springs has put a
[SPEAKER_13]: moratorium on butane extraction,
including in a closed loop system and
[SPEAKER_13]: under all these new regulations that have
been put on the extraction labs.
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you dump that down just a little bit?
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't really understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're saying no more blasting?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can't do it open, which are the new
regulations.
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to have closed loop system and a
certain type of environment under certain
[SPEAKER_13]: code and things like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: But now they're outlawing even that in
Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_13]: And apparently what it was is one guy
from, I forget his name, from the
[SPEAKER_13]: building, some building department or
something in Springs kind of decided that
[SPEAKER_13]: these electrical codes and certain things
were not sufficient to even have a closed
[SPEAKER_13]: loop system in.
[SPEAKER_13]: So here the industry is, there's a lot of
people making new rooms and everything
[SPEAKER_13]: under all these new codes that follow all
these guidelines.
[SPEAKER_13]: And this guy just came in and said,
that wasn't good enough.
[SPEAKER_13]: And apparently this department has final
say over fire department and all this
[SPEAKER_13]: other stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you guys hear that cough in the
background, that's Adam being a big sissy.
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're working to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think the guy, from what I
understand, is going to tell the industry
[SPEAKER_13]: what he wants as his regulations or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it may be, like the video I saw,
they said it may be a week, it may be a
[SPEAKER_13]: year before this is fixed.
[SPEAKER_13]: You just never know with this stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's just happened yesterday
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's- Do you know how many
extraction-able?
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is, open blasting is actually
technically illegal anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is only relating to dispensary OPC
grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: So state regulated, MED regulated grows
that are blasting their, it's not even
[SPEAKER_03]: blasting anymore at this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's processing in a closed loop system.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many of those legal MED regulated
MIPS, OPC regulated blasting sites,
[SPEAKER_03]: processing facilities, I guess we'll call
them, how many of those do you think or
[SPEAKER_03]: know of in Colorado Springs?
[SPEAKER_13]: I know of two for sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know there's probably a couple more just
because some of the dispensaries have
[SPEAKER_13]: their own MIPS license and stuff that they
can process under.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I know two of for sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: And one's fairly new to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's kind of a bummer because they
just spent a lot of money building their
[SPEAKER_13]: shit for licensing and everything.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's getting shut down.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's shut down now, which is, you know,
that's- They can still run their garden,
[SPEAKER_13]: but they can't extract it.
[SPEAKER_13]: With butane.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can still run CO2.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can still run- Can water, but- So can
the garden that we're talking about that,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay, a garden in Springs that was
actually being grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what happens guys, if you're listening
from, we've got a listener that listens in
[SPEAKER_03]: London.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, so we have to keep in mind that-
Respect, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we have to keep in mind that not
everybody, my mic sounds funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the music.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to keep in mind that not everybody
knows Colorado shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: These places grow a large garden,
like a thousand plants, and they harvest
[SPEAKER_03]: the entire garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they run all of that through a
closed loop butane extraction machine and
[SPEAKER_03]: turn all of it into hash, into B-H-O,
dabs, shatter- Processed.
[SPEAKER_13]: Wire want to concentrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that sells for somewhere between,
depending on where and who, between 30 and
[SPEAKER_03]: 60 a gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're getting into live resin,
it's 85 to $100.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these guys are making large portions
and portioning it up into grams.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they deliver it back to the
dispensary and then the dispensary sells
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the dispensary takes their grow that
they have leftovers of and sends it to the
[SPEAKER_03]: extraction company for them to blast or
process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they take all of that product
back to the shop and sell it on the
[SPEAKER_03]: shelves.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these guys are growing large,
large gardens just for processing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I see them doing, you run your
large garden, you chop it, you dry it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you drive it up to Denver to your
processing facility or down to Pueblo to
[SPEAKER_03]: your processing facility where it's legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you run it there and then you
just have to drive twice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is forcing closed loop systems,
correct?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, closed loops in a band also in
Colorado Springs is part of this
[SPEAKER_03]: moratorium.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the closed loop system is what the
industry standard is now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You cannot blast open.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this not doing anything but like
upgrading the hash?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it kind of sounds negative when it
's coming from YouTube, but to me,
[SPEAKER_04]: it sounds like more people are going to be
making unicorn hash and we're going to go
[SPEAKER_04]: away from the butane nasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they just banned, you can't even
make unicorn hash now, which is a live
[SPEAKER_03]: resume, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you can't do any of it in Colorado
Springs.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to drive the black market hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys that are unlicensed like me,
I'm a grower and I'm a breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how to make the dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I let other people do that for
me, but I'm going to have to.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I live in Colorado Springs,
I can't get it now because it's not being
[SPEAKER_03]: made.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have to go in my backyard and
open blast my own product, which is taking
[SPEAKER_03]: it back to where it was a lot of the
problems in the first place.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's what prohibition does.
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes back and forth.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just trying to reprohibit
prohibition.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado Springs is kind of a strange city
anyway for being such a big city.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've banned all the recreational
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they're banning blasting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of military up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to mention the event ban
pushback?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to Daniel for making this
decision.
[SPEAKER_13]: Secret Cup Mountain Region, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: And yeah, big up to him.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if anybody is mad about it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't heard any bad reviews on this
decision.
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't seen anything on it either.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_13]: He pushed the Mountain Region back.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure it was a community decision to
some extent.
[SPEAKER_13]: It wasn't just Big D going, oh,
I'm fucking doing this.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's just not how he does.
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel like doing it tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_13]: But no, they had just wrapped up the East
Coast.
[SPEAKER_13]: The Beast Coast.
[SPEAKER_13]: Shout out to Bobby Nugs.
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently that was badass.
[SPEAKER_13]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_13]: I watched the video.
[SPEAKER_13]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had some pretty high numbers and some
pretty high.
[SPEAKER_13]: So after that, you know, Secret Cup
administrators decided that they needed to
[SPEAKER_13]: make Colorado the home state.
[SPEAKER_13]: Secret Cup administrators.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: So Big D and Jeremy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: As badass as the Beast Coast was,
you know, and they didn't feel like they
[SPEAKER_13]: could do that within, like, a week and a
half.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they have had several venue changes,
several issues with Denver.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the venues they could get locked down.
[SPEAKER_13]: So they finally have a good venue locked
down and they're getting everything else
[SPEAKER_13]: squared away.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they pushed it back to the end of
September.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so it's still happening and they want
to just make it badass and not half-ass.
[SPEAKER_13]: So good job on that decision for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything that'll leave more time for
people to get ready.
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, Big D offered to pay any expenses
that were extra incurred on people who had
[SPEAKER_13]: already had plane tickets that had to
trade a man or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like he had posted right on Facebook that
said, just prove to me what you're out and
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll take care of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like if you need to back out of the
competition or whatever, I understand.
[SPEAKER_13]: No big deal.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like we can refund that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, so, I mean, he offered to fucking
pay airline fees for changing tickets if
[SPEAKER_13]: there were, you know.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was like, that's pretty cool,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big D.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up, Big D.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, if you guys were trying to come
to the secret cup, the date has been
[SPEAKER_03]: changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have they announced the new date?
[SPEAKER_13]: September 27th or something, I think?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they announced like the week.
[SPEAKER_04]: They said we'll probably pin down a date
as it gets closer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's kind of how they do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He may have the date right, but I didn't
really look since it's been pushed back.
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to say the 27th, 28th.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool because before it was the same day as
a Phish concert.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sorry, but Phish won.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it'll be that Saturday and Sunday,
the 27th and 28th of September.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys got any, any plugs you want to
do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Any more you want anybody to check out?
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody you want to fucking mention while
you got your ad on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Adovergrowthegov.
[SPEAKER_03]: Adam is Adovergrowthegov.
[SPEAKER_03]: Twitch and whatever that other T one is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Twitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Adovergrowthegov on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find him there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Send him, send him filthy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: He likes it.

[SPEAKER_03]: Any plugs?
[SPEAKER_03]: Advertising?
Nah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah?

[SPEAKER_13]: We did a lot of cool shout outs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Diamond Dave and the
Compound.
[SPEAKER_03]: Diamond Dave.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love to fuck with Dave, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: If he listens, that's it, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, God, you're so fun to mess with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big ups to our friends that are crushing
it in Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got a large grow facility in Clark
County.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if he wants me to say his
name on a podcast or not, but he knows who
[SPEAKER_03]: he is.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got that Hells Angel OG that tested
at 30% THC.
What?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a multiple cup winner.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got the cup.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're the homie.
[SPEAKER_14]: Get the hook up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's his Vegas prize.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got to hold that tight to the chest
for a little while.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got to hold that tight to the chest
for a little while.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the one that's going to make
the man a million bucks.

getting a little bit wrecked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm with you on that.

[SPEAKER_03]: Much respect to all of our sponsors for
making the show possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really appreciate you guys for helping us
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's get right down to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse came over for a grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_03]: Taught us a lot of stuff about outdoor
growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Adam hung out and learned a few things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to let the music play for a
second.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go ahead and fade in that
conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after that, Adam and I will be
back to wrap up the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hang on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, guys.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eventually they're just going to fucking
stick my iPhone in my head and I can just
[SPEAKER_03]: think like text Adam and tell him to come
over and take dabs with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're recording now just so that you guys
are aware.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your next thought would be a little weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what's up guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just here having a little random
conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have a grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got Jesse back as promised.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, Adam's back.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's on the show all the time,
but you guys might not know that Adam's a
[SPEAKER_03]: new grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's kind of new to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's his first grow season here and he
does have some outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I invited him to stick around while
Jesse's here.
[SPEAKER_03]: He may have some good outdoor questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: He may bring up some shit that we may
overlook.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's always good to have a new guy in
to kind of referee us because been told
[SPEAKER_03]: we're kind of snobs and we go a little
fast and we talk about shit like every
[SPEAKER_03]: body should know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll slow down.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll try to go slow for you guys and keep
it at a pace where you can keep up.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do plan to increase the knowledge in
this show slowly but surely over time so
[SPEAKER_03]: that you guys can all improve.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take your grow to the next level.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Knowledge is power.
[SPEAKER_03]: That came from Adam.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Never stop learning.
[SPEAKER_03]: That might be the smartest thing Adam's
going to say all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys said I was too loud in the
headphones.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to turn that shit up now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you were too loud in my headphones.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So of course we're back for an outdoor
grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's full bloom time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your plants should be starting to flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rocking and rolling.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Signs of flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully you guys have pulled your mails.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time to pull the mails now,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's past time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Way past time.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you haven't pulled your mails,
you've got a seeded crop and your
[SPEAKER_03]: neighbors have a seeded crop and someone
else on the block has a seeded crop and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're all pissed off at you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you fucked up.
[SPEAKER_03]: But hopefully you pulled your mails by now
because you're in full bloom.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that means we're probably 25,
30 days in.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's pulling out a calendar is why we have
a little bit of silence.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: For some strains.
[SPEAKER_07]: For some strains.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Adam was saying he had one that took a
long time to switch into flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just now getting to the point where
it's like visibly flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: It probably switched last week or so,
officially.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it had definitely taken, it might be a
little bit longer, but the other two had
[SPEAKER_04]: switched into flower three or four weeks
ago, obviously, and now have decent size.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's quarter size buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about where I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a random question.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long since you're an outdoor grower?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm asking Jesse.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's an inexperienced outdoor grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a city boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I live indoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grow indoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't worry too much about the outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know the answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am a city boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You take me to the sticks and I'm fucking
scared, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need a gun to fucking protect myself out
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you don't jump at everything,
I'm like, what was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: That was fucking life, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chill out.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was I going to ask you now?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long do we have?
[SPEAKER_03]: How many weeks or about when do you expect
frost?
[SPEAKER_03]: When does it get too cold for our outdoor
crop?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's always a good question if I need an
answer to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not Mother Nature, are you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've noticed... Sorry, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you agree that in Colorado,
in Pueblo, Colorado, nature loves to snow
[SPEAKER_03]: on Halloween and fuck up all the kids'
costumes on Halloween?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of our traditional... Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So get them down October 30th.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll start to be able to tell.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys... First cold snap.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to grab a calendar right
quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see how many weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just ask Siri.
[SPEAKER_03]: She'll tell me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Siri is great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many days until Halloween?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: She'll tell me.
[SPEAKER_03]: She failed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Siri has been a not friendly chick today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many days until Halloween?
[SPEAKER_03]: She's looking.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 70 days until then.
[SPEAKER_03]: 70 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, so most strains should be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even your stuff that just started
flowering should be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
Yeah.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: 70 days from... So today is actually
Thursday.
[SPEAKER_03]: The show won't go up until Monday morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're going to have closer to 65.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you probably won't listen until
Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're kidding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got about nine weeks to flower,
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nine or 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Depending on where you are, if you're in
California, you can get that shit out no
[SPEAKER_03]: problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're in Colorado, you got about
nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're higher up, if you're towards
Denver, you may want to cut that little
[SPEAKER_03]: closer to Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_07]: People, folks in California have been
flowering longer than us.
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems like a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: From the pictures I've seen, they
definitely went into flower sooner.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can imagine several things why that
would be, but I wonder what the actual
[SPEAKER_07]: reason is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think they've selected better
strains?
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: Auto flowers?
[SPEAKER_07]: Send all hate mail to... I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if the coast, maybe just their
different region, they're at a different
[SPEAKER_07]: latitude and longitude in the earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: North and south makes a huge difference.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: They get the sun a slightly different
angle or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys, if somebody understands why those
plants in Cali flowered sooner,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we just nailed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you got the sciencey reason,
tweet that to me, email it to me,
[SPEAKER_03]: iGrowCulture at hotmail.com, at
iGrowCulture on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd like to understand more of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: iGrowCulture on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get it, but we want you to explain it
because we're podcast hosts and stoners.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can explain it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd like to understand.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I asked Jesse when he got here,
we took a bunch of dabs, of course,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then we talked about what we wanted to
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: He talked about top dressing a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to talk about the mulching and
the top dressing?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's safe to say to go ahead and
switch over all your top dressings and
[SPEAKER_07]: your tees and stuff to throw in that high
P stuff, high PK, pretty much chill out on
[SPEAKER_07]: the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Adam's got some plants that are nitrogen
deficient visibly on the lower... Lower
[SPEAKER_03]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lower third of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I told him to hit it real good with
nitrogen one more time, real hard for his
[SPEAKER_03]: feeding and he'd think, yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to turn this mic a little more
to your face.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting Jesse trained on podcast
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: He'll be a lot more audible now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just noticed that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can hear him.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: No worries, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're learning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, you're way... I got to compliment
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're way more comfortable, way more
fluid on the show now compared to the
[SPEAKER_03]: first episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you were on number eight or six.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no number eight and we're at 26
now, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've been coming quite a few times.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, keep going.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I totally interrupted you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe a little foliar feed locally just to
that part of the plant, a high nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_07]: several different ways you could do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: My option is basically to put grow in a
bottle and spray it.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, really dilute.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would work.
[SPEAKER_04]: If anything, that's my problem is I'm a
little underfeeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you gave me the chart and I've
just been basically going off of that
[SPEAKER_04]: besides all the additives that I should
have gotten probably by now that I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I told Adam to buy a couple of
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't get them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So... Well, now you can see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now that's understandable.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a new grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have a budget to allocate to
growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a family, you got a life.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm learning to do chemicals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Learn to take nutrients, not chemicals.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to avoid the word chemicals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chemicals is a scary word.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nutrients is a safe word.
[SPEAKER_04]: I steered clear of Miracle Glow in the
East Coast because... When you harvest
[SPEAKER_03]: this, try to either, if you have a patient
friend that needs some medicine or I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know the fucking straight way to do that,
but save the money that you normally would
[SPEAKER_03]: have gone to your caregiver or your
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Save that money next year because you're
going to have your own pot because you're
[SPEAKER_03]: growing it and buy those bottles that you
could not get this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make your shift a little bit better next
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the next year, a little bit
better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then by the time you're just an
amateur grower, you don't need the fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: Rockstar drum set yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the time you're a good Rockstar,
you'll have a Rockstar setup.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's easier to learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: I became a good grower because I started
with struggle bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started with a shitty setup and it was
like, no, this sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then had to grow a whole crop through
that because you don't want to rebuild
[SPEAKER_03]: your room in the middle of a grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then bought the next upgrade and then
realized... See, I've never had a room.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've always had like a small box with
plants in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then now it's outdoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you were never in a state where you
could just go to the grow shop and be
[SPEAKER_03]: like, I need this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could walk in.
[SPEAKER_03]: It almost feels like we're cheating.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost too easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is cheating at this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost too easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go back to top dressing with mulch.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should be hooking them up with your
full bloom feed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you were saying, pull back on the
nitrogen, get your phosphorus and
[SPEAKER_03]: potassium in there heavily.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're mulching.
[SPEAKER_03]: Explain that to the guys that like,
fuck, I'll tell you, I'm retarded on
[SPEAKER_03]: mulching.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know how to mulch my yard and my tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are we using for mulch for our weed
plants?
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been using fresh green matter.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of it's from the plant itself,
the leaves.
[SPEAKER_07]: And weed seed things I've been pulling up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also I've been, well,
I've been mixing that with straw that's
[SPEAKER_07]: been composted.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm building a mulch mound around the
plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably eight, 10 inches tall.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the circumference of the, yeah,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm picturing a coffee can is kind of what
I see a coffee can shape.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's a fricking mound,
man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, yeah, no, it's pretty,
you know, maybe closer to like 10 or 12
[SPEAKER_07]: inches in the center.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're coming out probably two feet
circumference.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when I've removed part of it to apply
top dressing, the root growth that I've
[SPEAKER_07]: seen is just phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_07]: The soil just looks better.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks happier.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not as tight as it normally gets when
it's getting sunbaked.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I've always mulched a
little bit, but never to this extent.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in nature, wouldn't leaves fall off of
a plant and kind of decompose where the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant's growing and provide that nutrient
for next year?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that makes a lot of great sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's my question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you ever worry about heat with that?
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I did initially because,
I mean, it's hot.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's why I've always kind of steered
away from it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But doing the big mound with, you know,
it's just, it's worked great.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it'll be dry on top,
but as I work down into it, I've looked
[SPEAKER_04]: for something to keep the heat off my soil
because my soil is just baked and I tried
[SPEAKER_04]: to sand because somebody was like,
I'll just put a layer of sand on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I went out there and my plants were
like... The sand choked them out good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't use sand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't use sand.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can get rid of your dirt bugs with
sand.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do it, use a really tiny,
tiny layer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just make some diatination so it's into
your feed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Reapply it every single time after you
water.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a gigantic thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it looks like we've kind of worked over
to one of the things that we wrote down to
[SPEAKER_03]: talk about watering.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're outdoor growing, it's been at 90
something degrees in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: How much water do you water?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Adam, I'll ask you first because
Jesse's going to have a lot to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're kind of a new guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: What size are your pots?
[SPEAKER_03]: Five gallon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your plants, from what I see, look to be
about four feet tall?
[SPEAKER_03]: One's four foot.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other two are right at my chin.
[SPEAKER_03]: So about five foot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just looking at pictures on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys haven't gone over there and looked.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want a spider mites.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a gardener joke.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are razzling.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: He does not have bugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only in his hair.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Only the beneficial kind.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got four foot tall plants and five
gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_03]: How often and how much are you watering
those girls?
[SPEAKER_04]: Every day before the sun comes up,
getting the hose out and literally filling
[SPEAKER_04]: it up to the top three different times.
[SPEAKER_04]: By the end of the day, they are dry and I
can pick them up with one hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you guys got to get on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every single day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you think, oh, I'll just wait until
noon.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you won't because you will go out
there and they will be sad.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you had pieces of lump and you'll be
like, oh my God, what have I done?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've waited till nine or 10 and went out
there and they're screaming for water.
[SPEAKER_04]: So water your plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Water your plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: Try wrapping some white plastic around
them.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: White plastic.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll reflect the heat instead of retain
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: And get you a good size mulch going.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another thing about the mulch.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just pulled a whole bunch of weeds out
of my yard.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were tall and atrocious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I just throw them in a bucket and
start mulching them?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm worried about bugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: The plant matter I can definitely work
with.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be a little nervous about that
personally.
[SPEAKER_07]: So don't just grab any weeds and start
mulching it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm select about mine.
[SPEAKER_07]: My weeds are actually morning glory seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if anyone knows anything about morning
glory, they're highly, highly invasive.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's easy to find.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how much water, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: How big are your plants outdoors?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I even ask you that?
[SPEAKER_07]: I can avoid questions you don't want to
answer.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're doing like a six to eight foot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Each one's probably minimum of four foot
in circumference.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're in the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: That takes three of us to put our arms
together to get around it probably.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Stocks as big as that water bottle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: The stocks are as big as my forearm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming out of the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty gnarly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Moved from plants to shrubs.
[SPEAKER_03]: How much water does a plant that size take
every day?
[SPEAKER_07]: Seven and a half to 10 gallons a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Times however many plants he's got.
[SPEAKER_03]: We won't even go there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So de-fluorinated, filtered, aerated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly what I was headed to.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got to be hauled in somewhere if
you're out in a rural area, because
[SPEAKER_03]: there's not enough water to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're just coming out of your well,
sometimes you don't want to drain the
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to have water for your life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pish your neighbors off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even think of that shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the federal government regulates
most wells.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: They can't know the truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're real understanding of pot grows as
I understand it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're real inviting for that sort of
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've covered a lot about water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man, there was a hum and I just found
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a squeal in my headphones.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope it only happened in my ears,
but it went blalala just a minute ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my headphone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Could have been my head.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, that's something we talked about
a few episodes ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: The federal government is banning fucking
water use for dispensaries and grows,
[SPEAKER_03]: which if they catch, if a federal agent,
federal agent, if somebody for like the
[SPEAKER_03]: Department of Water Works or somebody,
someone that works in a federal agency
[SPEAKER_03]: discovers water in their municipality
being used for a cannabis grow,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're supposed to report the cannabis
grow in the water.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something we talked about a few
episodes ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wack shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be careful you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be super careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to be super discreet.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked a little bit about worms.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were saying that the worms were
crawling up into your mulch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That means happy mulch.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The worms get up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're probably eating those leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're probably secreting their enzymes
all over those leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those leaves are breaking down and
becoming nutrients that are more
[SPEAKER_03]: bioavailable to the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a win win situation for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you guys hear that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just my headphones or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like digital sound in my ear.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like a telegraph.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a fan on or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a digital noise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm tripping out over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like the sound of part of this
equipment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mine's gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's this, uh, H8O4 from Livewire
Solutions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've talked about it on the show before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck this thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's failing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's out now for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it out completely?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about now?
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it sounds better in mine too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Things works.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, whatever channel I'm on.
Solid.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Channel one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Never did nothing throughout that.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry you had to listen to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: This headphone app sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't ever buy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will not say the name of the company one
more time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Livewire Solutions H8O4 four
channel stereo headphone amplifier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't buy that thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my anti-sponsor right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys keep saying, why don't you buy
something better?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I bought this one and it keeps
breaking.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I go to guitar center and I say this
thing broke again and they just give me
[SPEAKER_03]: another one of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it just cost me a trip to guitar center
every few weeks, which, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're cool over there and I always find
new toys.
[SPEAKER_14]: So what the hell?
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully the company goes out of
business.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you get an upgrade.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I recall.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you're thinking, yeah, or at least
some store credit on an upgrade or
[SPEAKER_03]: something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just random talk guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you enjoy hearing us talk about
random shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get messages that are like, just hang
out and talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: We love hearing you talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was some of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably want to hear me talk about
weed and not my piece of shit equipment,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that's all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So worms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Worms are awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put worms by the roots of your plants all
the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, and if you find a worm, don't bury
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not how that works.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me re-explain that and not stone or
talk it.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you find a worm and you want to put it
into your plant, don't bury it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gently put him on the surface and work his
way down or it's way in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure yours are in the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: So finding worms in your plants are one
thing, but should I go out and get some
[SPEAKER_04]: worms?
[SPEAKER_04]: Would that be beneficial at the beginning
of when I first put the plants out there?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it would hurt.
[SPEAKER_07]: It wouldn't hurt.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're feeding bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of acids and salts in what
you're feeding.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to wreak havoc on your...
I've inadvertently had worms in indoor
[SPEAKER_07]: plants before, but never purposely.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about growing mushrooms in your soil
on accident, those yellow mushrooms that
[SPEAKER_03]: pop up?
[SPEAKER_03]: I see a lot of that in Colorado because of
the weird climate changes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got some crazy Grokashi compost going on
right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about to start doing some mushrooms.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to the Probiotic Farmers
Alliance, Gage Green Genetics,
[SPEAKER_02]: Keyplay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big love to all those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm really, really stoked about
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of the stuff they grow with that looks
great, looks amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been talking with Jesse a lot about
farming and stuff and not talking to,
[SPEAKER_03]: but listening to a guy named Jim Frere on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's an excellent grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a scientist, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's an organic chemistry guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He knows a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Between all you organic farmers and you
outdoor guys, I need a compost pile.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a vegetarian and I'm over there
chopping up pineapple, watermelon,
[SPEAKER_03]: strawberries, kale, lettuce, onions,
tomatoes, carrots, cucumbers, whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: else you brought me today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even get to look into the bag far
enough, but I chop up all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every one of those has a piece that you
chop off and don't eat.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: That little part where the stem comes out
or the little tip that's funky.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bananas have a peel.
[SPEAKER_03]: I eat a ton of avocados.
[SPEAKER_03]: They all have a peel.
[SPEAKER_03]: They always have some shitty brown spot in
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of throwing that in the damn
trash, I need a compost pile for all of
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, just try the Grokashi.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I've been doing is just a bucket.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got one right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just all veggie scraps, which would
be all greens.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got another one I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Started a little earlier.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's half carbon, half greens.
[SPEAKER_07]: Explain the carbon to the retards.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, I said retards because it was me.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Greens are living things.
[SPEAKER_07]: Carbon would be like peat moss,
I suppose would be carbon.
[SPEAKER_07]: Coconut or cocoa shell.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dried up sticks, dried up leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peanut shells.
[SPEAKER_07]: Egg shells.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to have a 50-50 mixture.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you don't have to have.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's ideal.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what you're shooting for.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just took a third of a cup of Grokashi,
mixed that fucker in there, threw it away.
[SPEAKER_07]: Six days later, I can visually see stuff
turning into humate.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you get that white web of life in
there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Big time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you send one to my phone and then let
me tweet that from the show's stuff?
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to tweet Jesse's pick.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm writing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've tried lots of different styles of
composting before, and this is hands down
[SPEAKER_07]: the easiest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that sounds like it's right up my
alley.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm super stoked because I'll be able to
have fresh compost all through the winter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I put carrots and shit in there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that soil is ready to grow some shit,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then just add that to my root organic
base.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to let it go for like a month is
kind of what I was reading from this guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm going to sift it out if it needs
to be, which is like a quarter inch
[SPEAKER_07]: screen.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just take it all, dump it on there,
sift it through.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll catch anything that's not composted
yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then everything that comes through is
beautiful, beautiful, beautiful compost.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good idea, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sold on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a quick rundown and I'm sold on
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two five gallon buckets and some table
scraps and a bag of Grokashi and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: making awesome compost.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, let's see.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a picture of this.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was day one.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a bunch of celery.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, coffee grounds are carbon too.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Looks like some asparagus maybe in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: She drinks coffee.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe some asparagus in there or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm a vegetarian and almost everything
I eat could go in.
[SPEAKER_03]: You always got something.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always watermelon, has a rind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Strawberries have that little green thing
at the tip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's got something, some sort of
waste to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bananas have a peel like I was saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything comes off the vine at some
point and where usually where it comes off
[SPEAKER_04]: the vine we as Americans don't eat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nigerian meme.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could even experiment with some scraps
from different grows and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, clean leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good clean leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Old stems could be my fiber part,
my carbon part.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, you guys just learned something with
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad we could all learn that together.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would guess that's what you do with your
fan leaves too at the end.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's what I do for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm tempted to buy a juicer.
[SPEAKER_07]: I also have another way of composting.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is actually the easiest way of
composting I've ever discovered.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feed it to my chickens.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not everyone has that luxury.
[SPEAKER_07]: They shoot it out at high nutrient levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was I about to say?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I don't even remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were so many things happening in my
brain just now.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get back on topic here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Snots berries taste like what?
[SPEAKER_03]: They taste like snots berries.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the stuff we're eating, we should
think about what we put into ourselves
[SPEAKER_03]: because that's what we should be feeding
our plants kind of the same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to feed your plants
watermelons, but think about what's in...
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, think about your health.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about your plant health.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all the same shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you start paying attention,
you'll match up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll start feeling better.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll definitely pay attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: I noticed that from the last show that you
were here and you said we go out and we
[SPEAKER_04]: spend the money on expensive bud and
expensive water, and then we just put 99
[SPEAKER_04]: cents.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the worst at that, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a cheeseburger fanatic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I told her straight up after that,
go get meals.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go make food.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: Me and my wife cook together.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't go that far.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[SPEAKER_04]: She looks at the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't give her ideas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut your mouth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get in the kitchen and cook, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: I cooked lunch with a little lady today
and it was a great time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I cook for her sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually she can't make bacon the best,
but you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: See?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's your job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then get in there and you make the bacon.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why they say it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Making bacon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Making the bacon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get back on track maybe a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my show.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do whatever we want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I was following you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with you, but we don't have to get
back on track at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk more about bacon.
[SPEAKER_03]: See any good cartoons lately?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone just leans back in their chair.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rick and Morty is great, but I'm not aware
of Rick and Morty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that show is so bizarre.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, if you want to say try to get
drinking and driving is cool off to
[SPEAKER_04]: children.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you've told me about this one where
the guy's drinking constantly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Constantly.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's flying a spaceship.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's clarify that and it's like,
okay, but he's slammed by the end of every
[SPEAKER_04]: show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't everything just better?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're hitting flower hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our plants are in flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're showing the fuzzies.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've pulled our males.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've top dressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our worms are happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've switched to full bloom nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're feeding bottle nutrients,
go lightly on the nitrogen there,
[SPEAKER_03]: the grow or the bloom stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if you're feeding teas and stuff,
what should we be mixing into our teas at
[SPEAKER_03]: this time?
[SPEAKER_07]: Sea bird guano.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty much where I get all my
nitrogen for the bloom phase from.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also most sea bird guanos
typically kind of high in P. Literally.
[SPEAKER_07]: At least a little bit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This show's way off track already today.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I should have known that was coming from
the look on your face.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need a dab, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get dabs going for everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sea bird guano, what else are you
putting in there?
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually had a conversation with a
gentleman about this earlier today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it Armando Vigil?
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you just want to throw him on blast
like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, he's a cool guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to actually not put him on
blast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to give him a shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: That dude listens to the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a loyal listener.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a shopper at Hygro Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a lot of support.
[SPEAKER_03]: He shops at the stores I recommend.
[SPEAKER_03]: He buys the seeds I recommend.
[SPEAKER_03]: He grows products I recommend.
[SPEAKER_03]: He listens to your advice to the fucking
word, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wants to do exactly what he knows that
success is proven and he wants to do what
[SPEAKER_03]: we are doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's a loyal listener.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's become my friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to come hang out with us the
next time he's around.
[SPEAKER_03]: He lives a little bit away from here.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was messaging me the last time he was
here, but I wasn't prepared.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was working and the phone was jingling
away from my pocket.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next time we're going to hang out,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I look forward to hanging out with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So shout out to Mr. Vigil.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure it's Armando Vigil.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get lost on names.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not even looking at a screen,
so I'm 90% sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's Armando because that's just
fun to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to take a Mondo dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to make sure I'm saying your
name right, bro, just because I'd feel
[SPEAKER_03]: like a dick if I'm all shouting out the
wrong guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go look right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to Facebook.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to get this out before I dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: The hypey bat guanos, if you got them.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're good.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not very sustainable.
[SPEAKER_07]: Any of those bat guanos really,
really suck, but it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not everyone's as conflicted as I am,
I suppose.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm shouting out the right guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy now.
Sweet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Switch to the hypey and rock it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Any molasses?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I always do molasses.
[SPEAKER_07]: I always do molasses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost every feed in flower after day 21,
I have molasses or something similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Humboldt honey, the Mendocino honey.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the Humboldt because it's got the
yucca extract in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Mendocino honey is dirt cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's dirty cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: There might be yucca extract in that one,
but not as much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, he's taking a pretty big dab right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Carb cap if you want it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really know why you put it on
that, but whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the type of shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just hard to pull it up with that
other dab or how it needed the cutting
[SPEAKER_03]: edge on that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Task rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out, brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: That completely made me forget what we
were talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope the listeners are taking dabs with
this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fish bone meal.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's always high in P. That's some good
stuff too.
[SPEAKER_07]: I always go with the kelp.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've noticed something.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder what's up with this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've had some kelp that is one,
zero, one, and then I just recently bought
[SPEAKER_07]: some kelp that is zero, zero, one.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the exact same strain or this is
derived from and it's that whatever strain
[SPEAKER_07]: that you always see.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder what's up with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't pay enough attention to the
packaging.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should start looking at that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's certain things I never pay
attention to because the look on my face
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't convey on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a very curious look now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they make different packaging for
different runs?
[SPEAKER_07]: There was different companies too,
but still, where did the nitrogen come
[SPEAKER_07]: from all of a sudden?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's supposed to be the same product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just different testing calibrations.
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's supposed to be standardized though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but a lot of shit is.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of shit is supposed to be
standardized.
[SPEAKER_03]: Supposed to.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my turn.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to take this big dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to give it to Adam,
but I realized how big it is and he
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't want to do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: He doesn't do that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should ask a question before I take a
dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I asked about teas.
[SPEAKER_03]: I asked about feeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time to finally train those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we want to do any LST training or
anything like that, we better do it before
[SPEAKER_03]: they start budding out like crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give them some sticks to support
themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said support themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Support with two P's.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I'm excited about this dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us about what we need to do and then
we will talk about, after that,
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll talk about problems to look for and
the biggest fear of all gardeners.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk about those two things.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to take a dab and Jesse will
talk.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I feel like I'm on the spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like how you got the mic right by your
face.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can hear you so well.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck, I'm stoned.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're training.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you got the bamboos, I like to stick
them in the ground at an angle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Attach the plant at a lower angle on the
bamboo so that it's still going past it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you angling in toward the pot or out
from the center of the pot?
[SPEAKER_07]: Out from the pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to clear that up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen both methods.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You actually want the bud dangling above
the bamboo and that gives it a chance to
[SPEAKER_07]: develop its girth and then it's going to
fall towards the bamboo and you wrap it
[SPEAKER_07]: up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of predict where it's going to fall.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, just straight up bamboos.
[SPEAKER_07]: With outdoors, make sure you tell your
plants in at least two places.
[SPEAKER_07]: The wind, once you start pinning plants
with bamboos and stakes and stuff like
[SPEAKER_07]: that, this applies indoors too,
but make sure you get them tied up in two
[SPEAKER_07]: places real good so that anything doesn't
break over.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was such a stone ramble.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said exactly what needed to be said
while Adam and I both got to take a dab
[SPEAKER_03]: and kind of get our shit back together
because I gave us big dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, now I'm kind of new to the bamboo
sticking just because I never had plants
[SPEAKER_04]: big enough to even need stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of asked him, he told me the same
thing the other day and I asked him,
[SPEAKER_04]: what's really the purpose of it?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, just to hold it there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I have a tomato cage and I went out
and I purchased the only sticks that were
[SPEAKER_04]: because living here in Colorado,
things are not quite as available as you
[SPEAKER_04]: think they would be.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were sold the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got little ones with the little rings in
them that I can just hold up my side
[SPEAKER_04]: because those are the only ones right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I figure I can just tie it with a loose
string.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got some branches coming in,
just holding it up against the tomato
[SPEAKER_04]: cage.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds like it's working for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: If nothing else, you can at maybe an
earlier stage run them through the tomato
[SPEAKER_04]: cage.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way you did it is perfect though.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing that Adam did wrong is he
tried to put the tomato cages on a little
[SPEAKER_03]: late so he had to struggle with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next time I'll show you a really smooth
trick.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just takes like a, I use a twisty tie
or a fucking like a pipe cleaner.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're called fuzzy sticks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just grab the plant from the bottom and go
up and then just tie that shit in a couple
[SPEAKER_03]: of spots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you go to slide the cage on.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the size cages I got, I think it was
still a little too late for that because I
[SPEAKER_04]: tried that trick when I went out and
bought the last one and it was just like,
[SPEAKER_04]: no.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just stuck it down in the middle and
it kind of branched it all out.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can also cut them open and then just
wire them back together.
[SPEAKER_07]: See?
[SPEAKER_07]: Jesse's a thinker.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse's a thinker.
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't think about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But next year I plan to have the small
square fence lines around it maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something that I've been seeing a
lot lately on YouTubes.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually tomorrow have to try to put one
on one of those monsters.
[SPEAKER_07]: The outside one.
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually sell a 16 inch tomato cage
that comes apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sticks are three different pieces and
the cage is two different loops that come
[SPEAKER_03]: apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can put that on after and really
endorse those tomato cages.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are fucking useful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're a good product.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually might've learned about them
through Subcool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, mine were 99 cents so I can't really
complain when it's user error.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to get it onto something.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was Adam's words of the wisdom.
[SPEAKER_03]: So problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys were talking about moths and
worms.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_07]: They are referred to in America as corn
borers and here's a little side
[SPEAKER_07]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're actually in Europe called a hemp
borer.
[SPEAKER_07]: When prohibition hit, there wasn't any
more hemp plants around so they went for
[SPEAKER_07]: corn.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking up a little bit on them here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm Googling it right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, that's why you got quiet.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know what a hillbilly knows.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what he's about to read for
us, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_03]: The European corn borer.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm just reading it straight from
Wikipedia.
[SPEAKER_03]: The European corn worm or European corn
borer, also known as the European high
[SPEAKER_03]: flyer, is a pest of grain, particularly
maize.
[SPEAKER_03]: The insect is native to Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Originally infesting varieties of millet,
including broom corn.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an ugly fucking bug, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it says the European corn borer
caterpillars damage the ears of corn as
[SPEAKER_03]: well as stocks by chewing tunnels,
which cause the plant to fall over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Biological control agents of corn borers
include... Sorry, I'm just going to read
[SPEAKER_03]: that part.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they dig a tunnel in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't see it and read it all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they lay little eggs in there and
then it shows these fucking disgusting
[SPEAKER_03]: orange worms that grow out of there.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is when I got all freaked out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what is this dark spot on my plant?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this is the kind of stuff that I
knew that stuff will burrow and lay eggs
[SPEAKER_04]: inside of and then rot from the inside
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never seen them like in the stock.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mine were like right at the base.
[SPEAKER_03]: They lay clusters of eggs on the leaves,
usually the undersides.
[SPEAKER_03]: The egg masses or clusters are laid in an
overlapping configuration.
[SPEAKER_03]: The larvae develop inside of the eggs and
the eggs become more... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these things are ugly.
[SPEAKER_07]: They eventually turn into a flying insect,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they fly, they land on the plant,
they burrow in, or they lay eggs on the
[SPEAKER_03]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they turn into these worms that chew
on your plants also.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the original flying thing eats your
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: The new worm they left eat your plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it turns into a flying thing that
eats your plant and comes back and drops
[SPEAKER_03]: more of these fucking demon bugs on your
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Terrible shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good ways to get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Prevention is the best way I've came up
with.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've spent hours picking them out by hand
because they destroy... Fortunately,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's not going to destroy an entire crop.
[SPEAKER_07]: They destroy a piece of a bud.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you're trimming at the end of the
year, it is very easy to locate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've spotted those orange worms in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually knew a guy that would dry and
smoke those orange worms himself through
[SPEAKER_03]: that crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, those are mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he loved it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He loved it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you talk shit about me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Monterey spray has some effect on them.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a great product.
[SPEAKER_07]: It contains spinosad.
[SPEAKER_07]: Spinosad.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our good old friend neem oil, but it
really sucks because you're spraying neem
[SPEAKER_07]: oil on a flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to ask, is that product okay
with flowers?
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, not neem oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what neem oil does.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't put neem oil on your flowers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Monterey... What can you do?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an organic... Use it as more of a
deterrent, maybe?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I sprayed my plants with it all through
veg.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every four days they got sprayed with
something different, mixed it up,
[SPEAKER_07]: kept it all organic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Something to scare those bugs away,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of
cure.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the goddamn truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've gotten... Man, fuck the moths.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's gross.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder... They're big too, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like the size of a big lighter,
except triangle.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're praying mantis isn't going to do
shit against those.
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great to watch.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a battle.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen one rip it out of the bud and
fuck it.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm sure that probably fills up a
praying mantis pretty good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're just fluff anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they get all that moth dust in your
mouth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gross.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, those things are huge too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a cool story that you fucking said
that they used to be hemp moths before
[SPEAKER_03]: they were corn, because Wiki didn't say
anything about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a cool little story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, look up hemp work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet it probably links me to those
saying, here, we'll do it just for fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise known as the corn moth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you mean this?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're in America.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, an old timer told me that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not a Wiki for it, but it's all
weed stuff though.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all like nasty bugs, nasty bugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the same picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gross.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that was a freaky sound whoever's
phone did that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, was that not anybody's phone?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that was my phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand why it's going off.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was dead forever ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I feel like an idiot because it
was my phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Still talking to you, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Still talking to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all the way down, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to call you out about
leaving your phone on on table during a
[SPEAKER_03]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Completely unprofessional about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, we have talked about moths and worms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than the obvious problem that you
know I'm going to bring up, what are any
[SPEAKER_03]: other problems we can look at?
[SPEAKER_03]: What can we look for right now that we can
work with, right now we can kind of try to
[SPEAKER_03]: prevent?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I mean, it's still pretty early
in flowering, so spider mites are going to
[SPEAKER_07]: come up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't fucking say that word.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't hear them either.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you don't have a lot of air
circulation and it gets moist and creates
[SPEAKER_07]: the conditions for powdery mold,
plan for the worst.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So get the... Damn, I can't remember any
brand names tonight.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actinovate, that stuff rocks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that for powdery mildew?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actinovate.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse shouts that out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm testing a product called Witch's Brew.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, as soon as I find a situation to use
it in, not to be a tick, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's called Witch's Brew and supposedly it
just like totally annihilates powdery
[SPEAKER_07]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's totally organic and made in up in
Denver somewhere, or maybe Boulder,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, up north somewhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's cheap too.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of you guys are... Sorry,
I don't mean to cut you off.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you're cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: You look like you might need a hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of you guys are not in places where
you're able to walk into a hydro shop and
[SPEAKER_03]: be like, yo, I need freaking a whole big
bottle of spinosad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hit the volume button on the wrong way
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking with something.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't be like, I need a big bottle of
Monterey spray.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was actually... Go ahead,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Say what you're going to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just looking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you were going to say something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Side note real quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get a Monterey Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where exactly where I was headed.
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are in Tennessee, Georgia,
Florida that might... I don't condone your
[SPEAKER_03]: growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't support that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't fucking do that illegal against the
law.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's up to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a grown man.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you happen to be doing that,
because I can't condone it, I can't
[SPEAKER_03]: support it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Vote for the right to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll go to jail if I say, hey,
you in Kentucky grow fucking weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you insist on doing it,
you can get your products at Lowe's and
[SPEAKER_03]: Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're really careful about what you
do, look for that Omri certified shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a few products.
[SPEAKER_03]: That Monterey spray that we were talking
about, it just says Monterey Insect Spray.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says contain spinosad right on the
bottle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spinosad kills a lot of insects that
you'll find in the garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neem oil is also out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neem oil is there for veg.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should use neem oil and veg often.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's your friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's affordable.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can dilute it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're really not going to hurt
anything unless you use it in flour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even spray the ground around it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw a product, I can't remember the
name, but it contains white oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little tiny bottle.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nine bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got some white oil in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not used it yet, but I'm sure that
that would knock out your flying insects
[SPEAKER_03]: and mites really quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to research the name,
but look for it guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you need some stuff, you can actually
get your products at a Home Depot or
[SPEAKER_03]: Lowe's or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just be careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be discreet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't talk about your weed when you're at
any store, even the hydro shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only place you can talk about your
grow is in your grow or at your table with
[SPEAKER_03]: your crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about problems in a garden
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about bugs and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: One more thing is fucking homies and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be careful who you tell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's your friend today,
but in like a week when you guys have the
[SPEAKER_03]: stupidest fight over the dumbest song on
the radio that reminded you with that
[SPEAKER_03]: girl, oh, you were with her too?
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you're not friends anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got a grow officer, or we're going to
steal his grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just shut up about your grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody knows everybody in Colorado
grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so much of it here that it's not
as threatening.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not as crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone's growing their own crops here,
but you guys that are in those other
[SPEAKER_03]: places, just be careful with your grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: I might have grown a plant or two before
medical, and there was no such thing as
[SPEAKER_07]: talking to anyone about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that vibe.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you go to the hydro shop before
everybody had a medical card, it was dead
[SPEAKER_03]: silence.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could hear the cashier going,
as she rung up your shit in the hydro
[SPEAKER_03]: store, and she'd mumbled numbers because
she didn't want Jesse to hear how much I
[SPEAKER_03]: just fucking spent at the hydro shop.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even write it on paper.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or the classic, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to say when you run into
friends at the hydro shop, if you and I
[SPEAKER_03]: used to run into each other, hey bro,
can I get a cut of that white widow?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, I'll trade you for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The shop owner will tell you to shut up in
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: That never happened to me, at least back
then.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's where we leave it at.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Jesse's got a horror story he's
going to share with me after the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming from out east, anything that I ever
had outside and was like, yo, check this
[SPEAKER_04]: out, it was gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to tell you right now,
it's always your friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm here to tell you right now,
nine times out of 10, if something's
[SPEAKER_04]: stolen from me, it's somebody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's somebody you know, you know what I'm
saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's somebody you bragged about,
so you just keep it quiet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't bring girls to your spot if you're
growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know what to look at anyways,
so that's weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well then, they just talk randomly,
and if they don't have any business being
[SPEAKER_03]: there, don't bring girls.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're just trying to be cool,
don't bring girls to your grow to be cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a failure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen women bring down girl rooms.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait until the pot's harvested.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you ladies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the loyal ladies that are loyal to
their man, but some of you girls don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know when to stop talking about the grow
room that you saw, and that's not your
[SPEAKER_03]: fault.
[SPEAKER_03]: I may or may not.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that guy's fault for taking you to
the grow room without knowing you well
[SPEAKER_03]: enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: I may or may not have had a plant snapped
in half a couple times.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so this leads us to something
that we all dread.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than the police, in Colorado,
we don't worry a lot about the police
[SPEAKER_03]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all obey the law.
[SPEAKER_03]: We either have a medical marijuana card or
we are an adult.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Colorado, any adult over 21 can grow
six plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you're allowed to grow six plants
at any house.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know that if Jesse and I lived in
the same house, I don't know if we could
[SPEAKER_03]: grow 12 outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how that works, but as a
medical marijuana provider, a lot of us
[SPEAKER_03]: have increased counts.
[SPEAKER_03]: You look like you might have something to
add to that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard it does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't want to be accused of giving
anyone legal advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do your homework.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in that spectrum, you know what I'm
saying, of where I'm allowed to have six
[SPEAKER_04]: plants, but I'm allowed to have three
flowering and three not flowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the law in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have six plants, three in flower,
three not in flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know the freaking logistics or
whatever the bottom end of the fine print.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if Adam and I and Jesse live
together, can we do 18 plants in the
[SPEAKER_03]: backyard?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: They seem to kind of be up on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They kind of seem to cock block a lot of
those moves.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're smart in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're catching on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, we digress.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse's walking so he's tiptoeing in his
Jordans through the kitchen trying to get
[SPEAKER_03]: a bottle of water.
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually heard a rumor that Pueblo
County is going to instate a 18 plant
[SPEAKER_07]: limit per household total.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that could happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like shit that Pueblo does,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're allowed to have six plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: God, do you just fucking change my whole
thought process?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have to go political.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I got a set in with the town hall
meeting the other day.
[SPEAKER_07]: With Sal Pace.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was campaigning for himself,
but someone brought up marijuana and he
[SPEAKER_07]: was real quick to bring up the fact that
they're planning on instating that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've already called him twice and I
left a message at the end of the town hall
[SPEAKER_07]: meeting.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of you guys that grow those little
tiny hydro plants are like six inches
[SPEAKER_03]: tall.
[SPEAKER_03]: You wouldn't be able to get shit off of 18
plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: I need clarification.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want clarification.
[SPEAKER_07]: Was he just talking recreational and stuff
like that?
[SPEAKER_07]: We're caregivers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got patients that rely on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll bring that up on further episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys will get into this and figure out
what's going on so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the start.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've talked about bringing the wrong
people to your grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've talked about trying to impress
chicks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the biggest fucking problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thieves, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are going to steal your outdoor
weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you grow for three years in a row,
one of those years, you're not going to
[SPEAKER_03]: get a harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be fucking stolen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take a break.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the old school rule.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do two times, take a break, find a new
spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ma'am.
[SPEAKER_03]: That really makes sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come back two years later, a year later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because make sure they're going to know
that crop is there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll go and look and they'll be like,
oh, it's not here to give up.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thieves are going to come to your
garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even want to talk too much about
this story.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just something that needs to be
mentioned recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: In our community, a 13-year-old boy was
shot in the back because he was attempting
[SPEAKER_03]: to steal somebody's outdoor marijuana
grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That dude was arrested.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's in fucking jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to go to court.
[SPEAKER_03]: He shot that person in the back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to point out this was a pellet
gun.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yes, it was a pellet gun.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a high caliber pellet gun.
[SPEAKER_07]: The pellet was not an actual firearm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the pellet is lodged in this kid's
organs and he had to be taken to Denver
[SPEAKER_03]: Children's Hospital to be rescued.
[SPEAKER_03]: He almost died.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's in critical condition.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not on either one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on one of these guy's sides.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not on the shooter's side.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not on the kid's side.
[SPEAKER_03]: The kid was a thief.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was in the yard.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was actually, the newspaper said he was
out of the yard and he shot him in the
[SPEAKER_03]: back, but we're just going to act like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was right next to the pot plants in
this story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking three in the morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was part of a gang as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to point out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's multiple, then he got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's the one that got it then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's put this story, let's put
everybody that's listening to this that
[SPEAKER_03]: has an outdoor crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to put this story in their heads
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got your pot plants outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like seven days before you cut them
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got a hard on.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just fucking drooling.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're rubbing your hands together like a
porno is about to start.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're fucking drooling like food is
cooking.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're about to go on the ride of your
life.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got your outdoor crop about to come
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's three in the morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get woken up to the dogs going nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get woken up to the fucking lights
coming on.
[SPEAKER_03]: You look on your security cameras that
hopefully you have.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to talk in a couple of seconds
about things to do to prevent some
[SPEAKER_03]: thieves.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I want to set this story here.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Those alarms are going off.
[SPEAKER_03]: The asshole's up on your security camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see him cutting down your plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's about to, it's a fucking 19 year old
kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's wearing a black hoodie.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't tell who he is.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's cutting your shit down, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's about to run out of your yard.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're in Colorado, like a 90% chance
there's a gun in your house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably you've got a baseball bat.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a camper, you got a machete.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about what you're going to do
because it could happen to you and you
[SPEAKER_03]: could walk out there and put your self in
a more dangerous situation than what
[SPEAKER_03]: you're ready for.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could walk out there and be like this
guy in our town that shot somebody and has
[SPEAKER_03]: to deal with a kid that could die right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that that kid's life was
worth anything in my house.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want something, I'll let you have
it and I won't kill you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like something fucking stupid
to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you need it that bad, it's not
worth killing you for.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll make more money.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll grow more next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Leave my mother plants and my seeds where
they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be just fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you have it like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas somebody like me who is depending
on those three plants, not only for me but
[SPEAKER_04]: for my old lady.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be rough for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would be spending money every week.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I'm trying to put that story in
these growers' heads now, these new folks'
[SPEAKER_03]: heads that haven't had to deal with this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me break it down from the suspect's
perspective.
[SPEAKER_07]: He got woken up at 2.30 in the morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: He grabbed a BB gun and he shot someone in
his yard.
[SPEAKER_07]: Protecting his plants in an effort to
protect his plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the cop showed up because he shot
someone and the cop saw his plants and he
[SPEAKER_07]: shot someone and the cops realized that he
valued his plants more than he valued
[SPEAKER_07]: human life.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now he's sitting in a jail cell because
these people otherwise didn't intend to
[SPEAKER_07]: harm him.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm highly conflicted on this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even if he gets away with it, his face has
been on the paper.
[SPEAKER_07]: His plants are still there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone in town knows they're there.
[SPEAKER_07]: The cops won't touch them because they're
not going to maintain that evidence.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he's going to have to spend lawyer
fees.
[SPEAKER_07]: He probably lost his job.
[SPEAKER_07]: His dad's been on the news.
[SPEAKER_07]: And even if he gets away with it all,
he still lost his plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it worth it?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a little boy has, I mean, so just
don't do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even thinking that, oh, I'll just get him
with the pellet gun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, you just coming out the
door with the pellet gun, they were
[SPEAKER_04]: running.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get yourself shot doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: What if he's got a real gun?
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I said.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can walk out and put yourself in worse
danger than what you were prepared for to
[SPEAKER_03]: deal with for those plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you love your dogs, don't turn them
out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it sucks, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's happened to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad you brought that up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully, let them go nuts.
[SPEAKER_07]: Turn the lights on.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can get a good look at the
situation, try to scare them off.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, maybe you got an elevated,
you know, maybe you can walk out on a back
[SPEAKER_07]: balcony or something like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, just scaring them off,
you know, throwing a rock at them.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see, you know, get the fuck out of
my yard.
[SPEAKER_03]: If someone's in your yard, throw a fucking
rock at them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if you know your dog's got the
situation, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can still literally hit somebody in
the head with a damn hand-sized rock and
[SPEAKER_04]: probably do some real good sized damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's my point is think about,
be prepared what you're going to do
[SPEAKER_03]: because I don't want you to have to,
the only way to be prepared for that
[SPEAKER_03]: situation is to think about it today while
I'm telling you about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that when someone's in your yard
stealing your shit, you don't panic and
[SPEAKER_03]: shit your pants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully, if you prepare for it and think
about it, you've got a plan of action.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how to get out there quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how to get rid of a thief.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want anybody to try to be a hero
for a pot plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to hear about anybody else
shooting more people for weed plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't need that kind of publicity.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not gangster to go to jail for,
you know, anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a weed grower.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't put that in the industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just, yeah, we don't need that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Colorado, we shouldn't be growing
enough to make it worth robbing us,
[SPEAKER_02]: which it sounds weird.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And don't, we're not defending thieves.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we're saying it's at the high road.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are the lowest.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we worked so hard for what we
have and in one night and a couple hours,
[SPEAKER_07]: they take it all away from you and,
you know, they leave it scattered down in
[SPEAKER_07]: your alley.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have to clean it up at eight o
'clock in the morning and your neighbors,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, finally realize what those,
you know, it's just, it's not worth it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had one plant taken from me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've grown one plant outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess how many I got taken from me?
[SPEAKER_03]: One fucking plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I lived in a snazzy neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_03]: That plant was in a nice backyard tucked
away.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the gardeners are the ones that
fucking took that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have never grown in my own yard before
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the year I tried it, it got taken.
[SPEAKER_07]: So three plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, damn.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess we've scared the shit out of
everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just be prepared guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not, I don't know what you're going to
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want you to shoot people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want you to fight people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want you to protect your crop
peacefully.
[SPEAKER_03]: Use your voice, scare the shit out of
them.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you look outside and it's your cousin
Earl, beat his fucking ass.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, for sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I was going to make the example.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're stealing Adam's plants and he
catches you, Adam's fucked if he walks out
[SPEAKER_03]: and tries to stop you.
[SPEAKER_03]: If Adam's stealing your plants and you
catch him, Adam is fucked if you try to
[SPEAKER_03]: catch him.
[SPEAKER_03]: The array of outcomes could be very broad
if there's a thief in your yard.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then again, me knowing that I'm going
to steal his plants, I'm probably not
[SPEAKER_04]: coming with just my skinny arms either.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're going to his house.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, he's got more than his big
ass arms in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where this all just keeps
going.
[SPEAKER_03]: It escalates.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very quickly.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it is not worth it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a plant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jail is the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should put some outside next month or
next year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try again next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grow indoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't shoot thieves.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my advice, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jail sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to go to jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to talk about, if we don't want to
lose our plants and shoot people,
[SPEAKER_03]: how can we prevent this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Dogs, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Big dogs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Keeping dogs in your backyard.
[SPEAKER_07]: Keeping them through at night.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're going to use them as security,
don't leave them.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are working dogs.
[SPEAKER_07]: They need to stay outside, have a good dog
house.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the summer in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: They should be outside protecting your
shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like a mixture of big dogs and little
dogs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those little yapper dogs.
[SPEAKER_07]: They wake up the big dogs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it's on.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: The big pit bulls will come do business.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got one.
[SPEAKER_07]: He doesn't sleep during the night,
during the summer.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's just gotten, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Trained.
[SPEAKER_07]: He knows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He knows that those crops are important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, if your dog bites somebody,
you're going to have to fucking deal with
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to take your dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to put your dog in
quarantine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure it doesn't have rabies.
[SPEAKER_03]: If your dog really eats the shit out of
somebody, hopefully it doesn't come to
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully, I want to use two dogs as
examples.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I got into a yard and Siroc and Nana
rushed me and barked at me, I would be
[SPEAKER_03]: gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a very good runner, but I would
run a record lap with those two dogs
[SPEAKER_03]: behind me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully that's all you got to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lights and cameras are your best friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lights and cameras are anybody's best
friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you live in a sketchy hood,
put some lights and cameras up on your
[SPEAKER_03]: house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flood lights and cameras.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once people see those cameras,
they know and they're like, I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: even...
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion sensors.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mount them high enough so that an animal
isn't going to set them off.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a couple little tricks you can do
with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: If that animal is big enough to set off a
motion detector over here, we got to
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking shoot it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got deer right across the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: Those deer may come have a snack on your
plants one day.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might want to keep an eye out for
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That could very much happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm putting the dog out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Believe me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know what's good?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if they want my weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd be eating good that week.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got one plant that smells like Skittles.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other three or the other two are just
like, eh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, it's early still.
[SPEAKER_03]: They shouldn't have much of a lot of aroma
yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So have you guys ever hung bells on your
plants, just like the Christmas
[SPEAKER_03]: decorations?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that effective?
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be.
[SPEAKER_07]: Deers are cowards.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't take much to scare them off.
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially, I mean, put yourselves in
their shoes.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're in someone's backyard.
[SPEAKER_07]: They do not know in the middle of the
night it is, and they're doing something
[SPEAKER_07]: they're breaking two or three rules and
laws and all kinds of shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to take much to spook them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's likely somebody you know,
so they don't want you to see their face
[SPEAKER_03]: or their clothes or their body language.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't tell anybody about those either.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tuck them up in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: When mine got taken, they were heavily,
heavily bambooed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had made a big old freaking bush out of
one little thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: The bamboos actually played, it was hard
for them to pull the plants out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I still had a couple branches left to each
one.
[SPEAKER_07]: So those bamboos serve a couple purposes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse brought up, oh go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might be leading to what I was going
to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: If they ever tripped and fell on some,
that really sucks.
[SPEAKER_07]: They weren't good for the VC.
[SPEAKER_03]: A great point Jesse brought up earlier,
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be friends with your neighbors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be a friendly, polite, courteous neighbor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep your yard clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep your backyard clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep your music down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep your grow discreet and make friends
with your neighbors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you think they're legit,
you can almost let them know you're
[SPEAKER_03]: growing and not have to hide that shit and
maybe share with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smoke out your neighbor and then they'll
know that that dang crop in the backyard,
[SPEAKER_03]: they got to keep an eye on it too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then maybe they won't steal it from you
because some neighbors will jack your
[SPEAKER_03]: shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then maybe if someone does come in the
yard, they'll help you out also.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll keep an eye on that shit because
they know that they've been keeping an eye
[SPEAKER_03]: on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you'll throw them an ounce or two
when it gets done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they'll come over and help you trim.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our neighbors on the farm are like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's foreign neighbors.
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be that way.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a little different.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys aren't living in the city.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a whole new ball game now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I made a little spike shape on my paper
here to remind me to talk about something.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of you guys are going to set some
kind of weird booby traps or some kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: things for the thieves to get hurt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't condone that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just like shooting somebody.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like letting your dogs out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to get fucking trouble for
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get manslaughter.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's also some places called man
trapping.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it really, really pisses cops off when
they see it because they think,
[SPEAKER_07]: oh, I could have stepped in that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially if you're in an illegal state.
[SPEAKER_04]: What if they arrest you at the front door
and they lead you to the car and they just
[SPEAKER_04]: go walking around back and it's dark?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just step on whatever you put down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you just assaulted a police
officer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not doing anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're handcuffed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Completely.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're doing things like this,
you've probably got a substantial crop and
[SPEAKER_07]: you're probably doing a lot of things
wrong and you're not really doing anyone
[SPEAKER_07]: but yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody showed me a Google map.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might've talked about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got this, a Google map where there's a
community in NorCal where you can tell the
[SPEAKER_03]: same dude set up like seven lots of
housing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, Jesse owns one lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Adam owns another.
[SPEAKER_03]: I own another.
[SPEAKER_03]: But since we're all allowed to have them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just subdivided all this land and set
up gigantic crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looks like you built all of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like one guy set up all these
crops for all these families.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those guys have a lot on the line,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: What if somebody goes in there and tries
to take 10 of those plants?
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got a lot to fucking lose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are five, 10 pound plants each.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would hope at that point of scale,
you can pay two dudes to sit around with
[SPEAKER_03]: flashlights.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone's awake at all hours of the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even want to set up the scene for
a shitty movie, but that's a lot of money
[SPEAKER_03]: on that mountain, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a short window when it's done and
not harvested, but could be cut when the
[SPEAKER_03]: growers are trying to let it get that
final few days.
[SPEAKER_03]: And man, just a few, the three of us
could...
[SPEAKER_03]: And it always seems to go in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you imagine the amount of work?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, all of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: How stressed out you are.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry to cut you off.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you're good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm horrible about cutting people off.
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you imagine just like all the... The
tension in your head.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: You show up that morning like,
oh shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that half an acre of fucking plants
just missing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So another thing that can help you from
getting ripped off, I wrote this real big
[SPEAKER_03]: we talked about it, be discreet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quit showing everybody, quit talking about
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so much fun to post Instagram
pictures and shit though, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a way to take pride in your work
though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Save all those pictures until the stuff is
done.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then maybe say, look, this is the
buildup.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to post to Instagram under
your real fucking name either.
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not even going to call out a couple of
people that do it, but I know where you
[SPEAKER_03]: live and I know where your backyard's
located and I see those gigantic plants on
[SPEAKER_03]: your Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a nice guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not all of your friends on your friends
list are.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think... I have mine on a select
few.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's taunting people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't show geographical landmarks in your
pictures.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: The color of your house, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The mountain in the background.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys got anything to add?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to finish this part up if
these guys don't have anything to add.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Adam and I are going to come
back.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go, we're recording on a
fucking Thursday right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Saturday, Adam and another friend and I
are going to go see Joe Rogan at the
[SPEAKER_03]: Comedy Works in Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh crap, Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we're going to do that,
but that is what Adam just said with the
[SPEAKER_03]: funny look on his face.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're definitely going to be... Joe Rogan
is recording his next Comedy Central
[SPEAKER_03]: special at Comedy Works Saturday night and
I was lucky enough to score some tickets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you, by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't thank you enough.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to see some irie genetic shirts in
the crowd when I watch the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what I was trying to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what I got told?
[SPEAKER_03]: I said they're 20 bucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm looking for that 20 bucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: As soon as I find that, then we'll get the
irie genetic shirts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Adam and I will be back in a couple of
minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to take a couple of dabs and
wrap up this portion of the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys got anything fun to say for
the end of this part, go ahead and shout
[SPEAKER_03]: it out right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to shout out anybody cool,
if you want to get... I did not get to
[SPEAKER_04]: shout out two people that listen back
East, my homie Stumps and QP James.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know they both listen, so... Who's
Dickfoot?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that one of your friends?
[SPEAKER_04]: Dickfoot?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know a Dickfoot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out Dickfoot, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a hellacious Twitter handle right
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course that Apothecanna that you
recommended said...
[SPEAKER_04]: Really helping her out, so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any shout outs over there, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're not that shout out guy,
but... Shout out to Organix.
[SPEAKER_02]: Organix as fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did not include Ross Cola and Queen
Cola in our shout outs on the last episode
[SPEAKER_03]: on 25.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm saying too because I
forgot.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be doing a lot of those.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want that guy to come explain some shit
to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ross Cola, if you listen to the show,
bro, we'd love to have you on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's a way you can get in touch
with me.
[SPEAKER_07]: He works for the company.
[SPEAKER_04]: You would probably make that happen,
whatever time he could do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm available 36 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Sean, if you're listening, bro,
come on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd love to have you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd love to hear you talk about Organix
as fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that's how you roll.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could learn from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: The listeners could definitely learn from
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd appreciate it, John.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the listeners, you guys hear me
inviting somebody really cool on.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we get them on, you'll be proud.
[SPEAKER_07]: He really knows what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's actually ran a...
[SPEAKER_07]: pretty cool little urban farm kind of deal
before.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got a real cool story.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a cool dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love to have him on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can bring the lady if you want,
if that's still happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I haven't seen you in a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hope I'm not touching on a sore subject
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to her either way.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was always fun to dab with.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, guys, it looks like it's time
to wrap up the dab portion of the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to give one quick shout out to
Dreadful J.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, mama?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for all your support.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grow those seeds with all your love.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back in just a couple of seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen to the music, shake your booty,
get down.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, guys, thanks for joining us for
another Grow episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to give Jesse a huge thanks for
coming out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you guys learned a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Adam, did you learn anything,
bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: I sure did, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You look like you're dabbed out over
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm fucking high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of fucking high, we had a super
great time last night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Adam, myself, and a little friend of ours
got to go see Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Joe Rogan recorded his next standup comedy
special for Comedy Central at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you think of that show,
bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never seen a professional comic,
so to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Besides when we went up to Denver,
but it was great, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I woke up in my cheeks and my ribs were
still sore from laughing so hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: My cheeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tony Hinchcliffe opened up for Joe Rogan
at ComedyWorks last night.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did 15 solid minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every second of his set was ripping.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a funny dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never heard of him before,
but he was definitely an interesting
[SPEAKER_03]: comic.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a little dark.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a little twisted.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're grinning and you're like,
yeah, that's right up our alley.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, Joe Rogan is a
legend.
[SPEAKER_03]: He crushed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He came out a little bit nervous,
I felt like, but he used it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He harnessed that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exactly what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: He grabbed that energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then somebody tried to heckle Joe
Rogan about 10 minutes into his set.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when he calmed.
[SPEAKER_03]: He totally broke free of the bubble of,
I'm recording a show, and he kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: chewed that lady a tiny bit of a chewing
of a new asshole.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just made her feel really stupid for a
second, like a comedian should do,
[SPEAKER_03]: and went back about his business.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a hell of a good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So shout out to Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be a great comedy special.
[SPEAKER_03]: ComedyWorks is a great setting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that a great setting?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We ate dinner at a place called the
Something Mushroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember the name, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: The Mellow Mushroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Mellow Mushroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that place was dank.
[SPEAKER_03]: That pizza was delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our server was pretty chill.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was one of the best pizzas I've ever
had, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not really a big pizza fan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you ate all the way to the end of
the crust and everything, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ate all of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: We killed that large pizza between the
three of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should have been enough pizza for four
people, but three high people had nothing
[SPEAKER_03]: to do with the dabs before the show,
the pregame.
[SPEAKER_03]: But hey, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're listening, a guy named Phil
approached me after the comedy show.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he asked me if I was the guy that owns
the seed company, because I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a tall white guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm wearing it wearing an irie
genetics t-shirt in the middle of downtown
[SPEAKER_03]: Denver.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, do you own that seed company?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, that's me, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Phil, if you're listening to the
podcast, if you found the show,
[SPEAKER_03]: congratulations and thanks for your
support, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was really cool meeting somebody that
just knew me from my seed company and my
[SPEAKER_03]: Instagram and Facebook presence.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So shout out to Phil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bro, do you have anybody you need to give
a shout out to in this episode?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, man, that's that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The guys I hit up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like we kind of rambled on the Joe
Rogan part for a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to our friend, Angela.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got to join us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a good time with Angela.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming to pizza and being a
really cool passenger.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we're going to wrap up the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys ever get to go see a show at
ComedyWorks, go check it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doug Benson will be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, I'm giving Doug Benson a plug.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doug Benson will be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys are pot smokers and you live
in Colorado, go see Doug Benson at
[SPEAKER_03]: ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the date is September 15th.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Monday.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we can arrange a little smoke
session.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me know if you want to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tweet me about it at I Grow Culture on
Twitter or email me I Grow Culture at
[SPEAKER_03]: Hotmail dot com.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, of course, find me on Facebook under I
Grow Culture and we will we can smoke out
[SPEAKER_03]: at the Doug Benson show after the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't smoke in ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_03]: They will kick you the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a note here that says watch your
mouth.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying not to watch or I'm trying not
to cuss so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that's one of my downfalls of being
a great podcaster.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll quit saying the F word a lot because
it's really not good class.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not good taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to try to quit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, on the other hand, you can talk like a
fucking pirate if you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not the host of a show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Arg.
[SPEAKER_03]: Arg.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to all of our pirate friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, guys, we're going to wrap it
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that the show is over, please go to
iTunes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Search for I Grow Culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find the review section.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give us a five star rating.
[SPEAKER_03]: After that, type in a comment and let me
know what you think of the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're listening to us on Stitcher,
please leave a comment there and give us a
[SPEAKER_03]: good review.
[SPEAKER_03]: All those reviews help the show move up in
the rankings, which in turn gets us more
[SPEAKER_03]: listeners.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to spread my message to everyone
who needs help or wants grow information.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have about a thousand listeners on the
past couple of few episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: A thousand people are hearing us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think 1100 listeners on episode 24.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the time I looked, the stats are a few
days behind because it takes a minute for
[SPEAKER_03]: the analytics to get there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there were 1100 listeners on episode
24.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the night we're recording 26.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it takes them two weeks and we get
1100.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the first week, we usually get about
800 listens when the first weekend episode
[SPEAKER_03]: is posted.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to give a huge thank you to all
1100 of you that are listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I want you guys to do me one favor.
[SPEAKER_03]: 1100 of you are listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody tell two of your friends about
the I Grow Culture podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just say, man, you know everybody grows,
smokes, loves weed, has something to do
[SPEAKER_03]: with weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if it's your mom and she's afraid of
weed, she can listen to us be a good
person.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're good people.
[SPEAKER_03]: We preach a good message.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the last part with Jesse, we said,
don't shoot people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're good people.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can break myths.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can educate people.
[SPEAKER_03]: If somebody's lonely and wants someone to
listen to, we've got great radio voices.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely educate people anytime you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, you can spread the word.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all 1100 of you, a thousand of you,
1500 by the time this episode posts,
[SPEAKER_03]: all of you guys tell two people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now if one of them listens to the
show, then we got 3000 listeners.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when iTunes and Stitcher really
start paying attention once you break that
[SPEAKER_03]: 2500 marker.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's all the ratings is really
doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it tells people that the show is
good, but more than anything else,
[SPEAKER_03]: it helps your relationship with iTunes or
Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when it moves us up in the ranking,
it shows people that we exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's like, it's just our brand
has more integrity.
[SPEAKER_03]: If more people are listening, people say,
oh, people are listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: It must be worth listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, when you're seeing a
killer band, nobody wants to dance until
[SPEAKER_03]: that first idiot dances.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just dance guys.
Yep.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: If anything that I've learned from
Colorado, just get out there and dance
[SPEAKER_04]: because there ain't people far behind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody wants to be the first dancer,
but those fifth and tenth dancers,
[SPEAKER_03]: those guys are all going to love you for
breaking the ice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's just, I'm not begging.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to, you know, let's just get
the show moved up there and that way more
[SPEAKER_03]: people see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: More people can learn how to grow high
grade cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Less people will be afraid of cannabis and
more people will be properly educated
[SPEAKER_03]: about cannabis and the things that go with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to- You preach a good message,
brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to big up the weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I feel like I'm an ambassador to the
plant now, to the whole industry and to
[SPEAKER_03]: the movement.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of speak, I'm the voice,
you know, there's a few of us that have
[SPEAKER_03]: podcasts and we're starting to be
recognized and I want to be- You're
[SPEAKER_03]: helping.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very positive for the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to be a bad vibe for the
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want people to think I'm a stupid
pothead.
[SPEAKER_03]: People do because I take fucking graham
dabs and I have dreadlocks, but that's
[SPEAKER_03]: just that- You prove them wrong every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really appreciated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys, I thank you guys all for listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm ranting and rambling again.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't forget the show is available on
iTunes, Stitcher, Swell.am and also every
[SPEAKER_03]: episode, all the way from episode one is
on iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody told me today, a friend of mine
that I just met in person today,
[SPEAKER_03]: another listener.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, Dustin?
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dustin was saying he listens to episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was listening to episodes one and two
and he's starting to go from the very
[SPEAKER_03]: beginning and he will catch up while he
gardens.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: In quite a while, you'll hear this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This shout out on number 26.
[SPEAKER_03]: 26, 27?
[SPEAKER_03]: 26.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're on 26.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do we do at the end?
[SPEAKER_03]: We give a big old shout out to my ninja,
Spence.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: Love you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm supposed to come hang out tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got tied up doing a podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: We went a little later than expected.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a big shout out to my ninja,
Spence in the Garden of Whedon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Huge thanks again to all the listeners.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks again for listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Adam, thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: So take a fat dab and give your mama a hug
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yo, it's Bobby Hussle representing for the
real big bud sound, Joseph Star.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the boy can't play with lighting a
broken guitar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, yo, Nicker T, you know we stay
smoking hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Hussle.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to episode number 27 of the
iGrowCulture podcast.

[SPEAKER_03]: bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here, people.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's there.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not even sure he's there,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hang on, I need a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I want to give a huge shout out
to Spence and the entire Garden of Eden
[SPEAKER_03]: crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm dabbing some live resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: What strain is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so high.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just took a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't even remember what it's called.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeti OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Yeti OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's written on there, but it's upside
down over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Yeti OG live resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's dank.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so high.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't remember the name or it's so
dank.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't remember the name of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all dabbed out right now and
everything sounds like I'm in a tunnel.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's epic.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just said the word epic.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am going to cough my brains out and then
we're going to scroll to some news.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, check this out.
[SPEAKER_03]: This news I found entertaining.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is coming from The Cannabis and it is
by Ricardo Baca from The Cannabis Staff.
[SPEAKER_03]: The topic says, pot shop owner,
80% of our customers come from out of
[SPEAKER_03]: state.
[SPEAKER_03]: Adam's over there shaking his head.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're an out of stater, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am an out of stater.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your out of state ID qualifies you as out
of stater.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm no longer an out of stater.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a resident.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been here longer than six months.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't realize that when they check
your- No, totally not.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel that because I'm a red card patient
and the place that has my card or the
[SPEAKER_04]: place that I like to go to anyways,
my preferred place is now recreational and
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a line.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a line to get in to get your meds?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same place.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can only take the same one,
two people back at one time and it's the
[SPEAKER_03]: same building, same- How long does that
line take you now?
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't been out there since they've
really done it besides one or two times.
[SPEAKER_04]: One time I've walked right in there
because there was nobody on there,
[SPEAKER_04]: but the other times there's been five or
six people ahead of me and people walk in
[SPEAKER_03]: behind me and they're like, oh no.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they just turn around and walk out.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a long time to wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to have a shop downtown.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not hurting for the business.
[SPEAKER_03]: People would wait in line for an hour
because the whole front of the place would
[SPEAKER_03]: be full.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I'm going to get into this
article a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says Ryan Griego owns a recreational
pot shop in Southern Colorado and he's
[SPEAKER_03]: putting out a bold, informed estimate
saying that a decidedly clear majority of
[SPEAKER_03]: his customers are from outside of
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to take a big breath here
because I can't even read after that dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the dispensary this guy is from is
actually, they posted a really cool shot
[SPEAKER_03]: of the Canna sewer in this article online
here, a really cool angle of the sign and
[SPEAKER_03]: the building styled shook in place with a
great Colorado background.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a dope shot?
[SPEAKER_03]: A dope shot, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even mean that pun.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I'm back on my game.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_03]: 80% of my customers are coming from other
states, predominantly Texas, New Mexico,
[SPEAKER_03]: Kansas, and Arizona said Griego owner of
Canna sewer and Pueblo West, which opened
[SPEAKER_03]: its doors in May for recreational
marijuana sales.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew there would be out of state
customers coming in, but I thought it
[SPEAKER_03]: would be more of a 30 70 split with 30% of
my customers from out of state.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's more severe than that on the flip
flop.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think severe was the right word.
[SPEAKER_03]: Out of state tourists account for 44% of
all retail sales in the Denver area and
[SPEAKER_03]: about 90% in mountain resorts such as
Aspen or Telluride, according to a recent
[SPEAKER_03]: study produced by the Colorado Marijuana
Enforcement Division.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys, we've talked about the Marijuana
Enforcement Division or the MED.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're the guys, the division in charge
of regulating the dispensaries and the
[SPEAKER_03]: grows and all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are in charge of the marijuana and
they regulate all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: They make the rules and they are also are
also a branch of the IRS.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty legit.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're a huge place.
[SPEAKER_03]: They make a lot of rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: They fucking put their foot down and it
matters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys tweet me every time I say the F word,
every time I say fuck, just tweet me and
[SPEAKER_03]: tell me to stop doing it, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to stop doing that on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to cut that word out of my
vocabulary.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not even a cool word to use for
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, but for a shop in Pueblo,
hardly considered in the same tourism
[SPEAKER_03]: league as Aspen or Telluride to make 80%
of its sales to out of state visitors is
[SPEAKER_03]: something of an anomaly even given
Pueblo's proximity, less than a hundred
[SPEAKER_03]: miles to the New Mexico state line.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not joking at all about the
differences between Aspen, Telluride
[SPEAKER_03]: compared to Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pueblo is, it's a cool place if you live
here and you know where you're going,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's a steel town.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a steel mill town.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a blue collar working man's town.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Aspen and Telluride are places where
you go to spend some time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have, we have a reservoir here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a river walk here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got some really cool trails and
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a castle about 30 minutes from
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Pueblo is definitely nice to come
and see, but there's nothing here to like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pueblo has this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has everything that a normal town has
and it's pretty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to say that 80% of our sales are going
to out of state visitors is kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: shocking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we have a lot of recreational weed
shops here and the shop that you're
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about is 100% recreational.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you think that the numbers are the
same across the board at the shops,
[SPEAKER_03]: at the rec shops, that it's 70 30?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it depends on your product.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's something I was going to get at
because the reason that the Colorado
[SPEAKER_03]: market is not shopping in a recreational
shop, we are either, and I haven't read
[SPEAKER_03]: this article in advance very well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I skimmed it because I found it
interesting for the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that a Colorado resident,
like you did, you became a resident.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got your medical marijuana
recommendation from a doctor.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got your red card.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you can shop at a medical shop and not
pay the 25% tax that's added onto the rec
[SPEAKER_03]: weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And probably you get better herb there,
I think at the med shops, but also most of
[SPEAKER_03]: the Colorado residents have been here and
we have a guy or a caregiver or just
[SPEAKER_03]: you've got the hook up already.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you start growing your own.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you're growing your own.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used, I literally used the rec shops
until I got my red card.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then once I got my red card,
then I used, it all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, I went into the rec shop with
somebody who just came here recently and I
[SPEAKER_04]: was looking for a certain product.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, I went in there because for
one, she hadn't ever done it before.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's an experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, everybody should go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stuff is amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a bottle of Apothecana extra
strength pain cream, Arnica peppermint
[SPEAKER_03]: juniper cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: This stuff, I have said on this show that
I'm skeptical of topicals and lotions and
[SPEAKER_03]: such.
[SPEAKER_03]: 24 bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was actually kicked down by the
Grammy Gatsby to me because I mentioned
[SPEAKER_03]: some shoulder pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a guest over the other night who
looked like hell when they weren't,
[SPEAKER_03]: when they were sitting at the table,
didn't look like they felt good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, what's up?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they said, neck hurts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And put some of this on my hands and
rubbed her neck for about 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my hands were high.
[SPEAKER_03]: My hands felt balloony.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate to quote Pink Floyd, but my hands
felt just like two balloons after.
[SPEAKER_03]: Extra strength.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can only imagine what that girl's neck
felt like after I rubbed that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet she was chilling.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or she just slathered it all over her legs
and then like, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: And she was talking about it's just one
that one hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, one that one hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: The person you shared it with.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Adam shared some Colorado cannabis that I
grew with a lightweight and that kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: wrecked their world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get a little back into this
article.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got high and got distracted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to the person that got a massage
with the freaking cannabis article,
[SPEAKER_03]: peppermint, juniper, cannabis lotion from
apothecana.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Huge shout out to Grammy Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys don't even know he's behind the
scenes working shit and you don't even
[SPEAKER_03]: know it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This article continues to say,
so how did Griego land at these figures,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially given the state of Colorado's
restrictions on tracking recreational
[SPEAKER_03]: customers information?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we keep seeing these statistics and
that's a question I raised twice now.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the second time somebody has
raised it for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're, you've already explained it
where they're not tracking your name so
[SPEAKER_04]: much as they're just tracking your
purchase.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, he comments on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he says, we have a media group that we
hired on and they monitor all of our
[SPEAKER_03]: social media and Google analytics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've paid close attention to the
progression of people searching on PCs and
[SPEAKER_03]: mobile devices.
[SPEAKER_03]: Griego said a lot of these numbers come
from inside the store.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone has to show ID and we check IDs
twice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once in reception and again in the
dispensing area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus our bud tenders are always making
friendly conversation, asking people where
[SPEAKER_03]: they're from.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: 80% is Griego's educated guests,
but while he knows he sees traffic
[SPEAKER_03]: locally, as well as from nearby,
uh, weedless Colorado towns, Colorado
[SPEAKER_03]: Springs, Walsenburg, Trinidad and La
Junta.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said he says definitively that he sees
more Texans than anybody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, that's a big state.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, our bro Kevin works at a shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not here tonight, but he works at a
dispensary and he says it's a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: Texans.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, not surprisingly, the out of state
customers are also spending more than the
[SPEAKER_03]: Coloradans.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, uh, I want to know what you guys
are paying for herb.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might've, we did this on my Facebook
page on the Irene genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know what you guys are paying
herb in your location.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tweet me at I grow culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me know, give me a good, don't tell me
exactly where you are, but let me know
[SPEAKER_03]: what state you're in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe what part of that state and let me
know what good high grade herb or whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: herb is available.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me know what it costs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I'll tell you in Colorado,
uh, I don't go to the shops, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know what an ounce Kevin knows what
it's, uh, actually we had a friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think she said it was four 60 that yeah,
recreational.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: About the high end of price as a
caregiver, my patients, you can find them
[SPEAKER_04]: for three 50 if you shopped around and it
wasn't really like, I want this quality
[SPEAKER_04]: and this, you know, you can still find it
cheaper depending on where you want to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, recreational that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to know what you guys are
paying, uh, on the street.
[SPEAKER_03]: Three right now in Colorado ounces,
depending on what you want, you can find
[SPEAKER_03]: an ounce for $150.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the dank.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the chronic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's maybe buy it for medical or 50,
but for the fire, it's about 200 blocks to
[SPEAKER_03]: 25 for a good tank ounce right now in
Colorado depends on, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you're, if you're just random dude,
if you've got the hookups that you'd
[SPEAKER_03]: rather go 50 bucks, believe me,
just that extra 50 and get that,
[SPEAKER_03]: that dank, that top shelf Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you got to go to the dispensaries and
get it, it's going to run you close to
[SPEAKER_03]: 500.
[SPEAKER_03]: $200 an ounce for that same 225,
$200 ounce.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, and I guess it's the Colorado people
are getting that stuff that the caregivers
[SPEAKER_03]: are growing or their buddies with the
caregiver grow or having some extra on or
[SPEAKER_03]: something.
[SPEAKER_03]: All that private Kush is a little bit
better than the shop lead.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's, it's harder for someone to
get on with a caregiver, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially if you don't have a medical
debilitating condition where, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, I'm not, I'm not medical because I'm
in a wheelchair.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, or I have cancer.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just knowing somebody that you trust
and want to assign as your caregiver.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's something we kind of skipped
over guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were talking about caregiver and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you get a, and now actually the word
is now provider in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're back in the day, it was
caregiver, but that was, sounds confusing.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you get your medical marijuana
recommendation from a doctor, there is no
[SPEAKER_03]: license.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a recommendation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a prescription.
[SPEAKER_03]: They recommend that you use medical
cannabis and they sign papers and you send
[SPEAKER_03]: that paper into the Colorado state
registry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they send you back a card that is a
registry card that says you are registered
[SPEAKER_03]: with state of Colorado to use medical
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you fill out your paperwork,
you were allowed to sign, designate a
[SPEAKER_03]: person that is called your provider,
which used to be your caregiver.
[SPEAKER_03]: This person, uh, the paperwork says they
have to be responsible for something other
[SPEAKER_03]: than just, um, procuring your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you should drive them to their medical
marijuana doctor's appointment.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should probably make them a kale
smoothie and work on their fucking person.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, fuck again, somebody tweet me and
tell me to stop doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a note in front of me still watch
your mouth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so you make them a, you go sit,
you spend time with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You make them a shake.
[SPEAKER_03]: You try to deal with their overall
wellbeing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're a caregiver, I think sitting
like you and I do, we hang out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not your caregiver, but when you're
having a bad day, when something's driving
[SPEAKER_04]: you nuts, I got my red card the same day
you renewed and you were there with a
[SPEAKER_03]: couple of my patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hang out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can tell that one of the guys is an
older cat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, he's a 60 year old guy and him and I,
he's my bro because like you come and sit
[SPEAKER_03]: on the table to sit at the table and
you're having a bad day and we talk and
[SPEAKER_03]: you feel better about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people that have AIDS, cancer,
major shit, they don't have those people.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just need someone to talk to you
because a lot of people are afraid of
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you're sick, people abandon you or
you just need extra, you need extra
[SPEAKER_03]: support.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if those people are there,
you can always use, I'm a young,
[SPEAKER_03]: energetic, youthful dude with a good
attitude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just spit right across the table at you.
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize for that one, but I didn't say
fuck about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think being a caregiver, that's part
of it going in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I write down spiritual counseling on
my, when they say, what else do you
[SPEAKER_03]: provide?
[SPEAKER_03]: I make smoothies and shakes for these
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I drive them to their appointments and I
provide spiritual counseling, just being
[SPEAKER_03]: your friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but so the caregiver is a person that
is responsible for providing your
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the, the actual Colorado law does say
that they are allowed to charge you money
[SPEAKER_03]: to cover the cost of your labor and your
lights and your expenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're not supposed to profit off of
caregiver care, get your caregivership,
[SPEAKER_03]: your providership.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, yeah, you can, so you can be a
caregiver in the state of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: All you have to do is decide that you want
to be a caregiver and learn how to grow
[SPEAKER_03]: and then find somebody that trusts you
enough, uh, and then work out something
[SPEAKER_03]: with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the dispensaries I don't think are the
centers don't give you a good deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just give you a little bit of a
discount.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, my guys, the third people that I'm
responsible for right now, there are four
[SPEAKER_03]: people, uh, and I know pretty much exactly
how much I can predict when they need
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be sitting around one night and go,
oh, it's about time for patient A to give
[SPEAKER_03]: me a call tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll put them a little package
together because I know what he needs and
[SPEAKER_03]: when he needs it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only that, but that way they kind of
have more of a specific and exactly what
[SPEAKER_04]: they need.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, high CBD, high THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grow that Tora Borica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the night nurse was bred for a
specific person, his two favorite strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our grateful dog and Tora Bora,
and I bred them together basically to make
[SPEAKER_03]: the perfect medicine for one of my
patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went that far for this guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus I know it's going to be a killer
strain, but I mean that he was,
[SPEAKER_03]: he inspired that strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's, you're not probably not going
to go wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even if you do, you know, it's a test.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's all an experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sitting there on the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to give that thing a little
smell, I've smelled it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the night nurse.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely frosty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, DNA genetics lets me use their Tora
Bora.
[SPEAKER_03]: They gave me permission.
[SPEAKER_03]: To breed with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got their award-winning cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, they let me use that to breed to the
grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it came out pretty snanky.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smells well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I'm going to run a bunch of testers
and maybe one day we'll put that to
[SPEAKER_03]: market.
[SPEAKER_04]: I define that at Naturesgreenremedies.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm more of the indica smoker.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas you're more of the sativa guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's weird about me, I like indica
flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, if I'm going to smoke a joint,
I want it to make me sit down and chill
[SPEAKER_03]: out and like, well, I just want a joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems more like, uh, sitting in a
hammock with my feet up with the little
[SPEAKER_03]: dreadlock girl cuddled up next to me and
some grateful dead on the radio and a nice
[SPEAKER_03]: breeze that's smoking a joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, dads are like taking shots.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't drink alcohol, but it reminds me
of when I used to drink Jägermeister or
[SPEAKER_03]: tequila.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the, it's more energetic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes my head spin a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't relax well after dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes me want to do shit unless I take
a half gram dab and want to sit down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We won't do that tonight on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will do a large, I'm going to,
it's almost time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the large dab thing is almost coming
to an end.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't feel as good about it as I used
to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting older, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, your lungs have so many inhales and
exhales, and I'm assuming by doing a half
[SPEAKER_03]: gram dab, I'm probably using a multiple
inhale and exhales, uh, for each dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd like to live a little bit longer
than I wanted to when I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't realize one day I was going to
fall over and die.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, we may do a grand finale.
[SPEAKER_03]: We may do like a gram dab or a two gram
dab or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Episode 100 episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's, that's a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, 50 or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to do it so that that way we
can retire the super large dab thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can put the dab challenges to a rest
and say, Hey, we're all alive and we can
[SPEAKER_03]: do the, the life challenge after that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're way off topic on this news thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, weed's expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be 200, 150 an ounce,
but these shops are selling it for 500 an
[SPEAKER_03]: ounce close enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you think weed is expensive where you
live?
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though it's legal here, it's not the
cheapest for recreational use.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but it's available.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's better than massively available
between the hours of eight and eight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a random question.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're from a state where cannabis was,
uh, hard to get.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've told me stories about waiting on
your dude for hours and hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that it was hard to get.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that everybody is too busy.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's other drugs that are more
important than your $10 dime bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, yeah, it's Florida.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys could imagine what kind of it
wasn't that hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was, it was a, but when I moved
back, so would you rather have,
[SPEAKER_03]: whoa, the internet just, it's refreshing
multiple times and freaking me out,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it went right back to where it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the music didn't cut out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you rather have, uh, so street weed
is cheaper, a little bit cheaper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I'm going to say 30 bucks an eighth on
the street.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, how much is an eighth of weed at the
dispensary where you would shop?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, for recreational, uh, that you can go
get your med weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, 30 at my shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every fourth of the 20th month.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how much is it rec recreational?
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: 60 bucks an eighth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 55 to 60, just depending on which store
would you rather have the convenience of
[SPEAKER_03]: going to the store and just paying the
extra money?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or would you rather sit there and wait for
some high ass dude to show up with a sack?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably a gram or a, uh,
just a joint, you know, from the pre-roll
[SPEAKER_04]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get high and it was eight
bucks or 10 bucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I could go out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It costs you a little bit of gas because
it's here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's outside of town, but some places have
it, you know, closer, closer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if I lived out there,
it'd be a different story.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but you could go buy a joint,
you know, I mean, it's as simple as that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that to me, I'm not going to go out
there and do it just because I,
[SPEAKER_04]: you move here, you get kind of picky.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're everybody in Colorado is a damn
weed snob now are all connoisseurs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was already a weed snob before I moved
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I only smoke Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: People would give me weed and I'd be like,
did you flush this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you even have a hashtag?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you even flush bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flush your weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk about that in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flush your weed, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of the easiest.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost free and it's one of the
easiest things you can do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just flush your weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll help out so much and cure and cure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's a whole, that's, I can talk
for hours about curing weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I will one day, but those are the
two things back East that people are like,
[SPEAKER_04]: what?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what a lot of people are failing
on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see a lot of Facebook posts about,
does anybody in Colorado know how to cure
[SPEAKER_03]: weed?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll share it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's different here.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's dry here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you need to build a humid room and
control your humidity.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just ranting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get back to the article.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I said, I had a lot of news and at
this rate, we're not going to get a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: news and news story.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a podcast, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it's going the way it should.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, these out of state consumers,
because remember we're talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: people from out of state.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how far it's been.
[SPEAKER_03]: These out of state consumers are spending
much more than locals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Griego said they're spending about twice
as much as locals, about 120 to $140.
[SPEAKER_03]: Edibles are the most popular with these
people out of state consumers can buy up
[SPEAKER_03]: to seven grams of cannabis total.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you see them by one to two grams of bud
and the rest of their allotment made up of
[SPEAKER_03]: edible products.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I am not up to date with that rule.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have to look that up in the
future here and talk about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is your edible?
[SPEAKER_03]: What, how much medical?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, they, they don't really distinguish
between the two.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm seeing your edibles for, this is for
recreational purposes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's out of staters.
[SPEAKER_03]: How much does my edible count as?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it's, I thought you and Kevin already
went over this where it was going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: weighed by the metric gram or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, I don't remember that
we're going to have to Google that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll find that out for you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Remind me to check that out and we'll put
that on a future episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I just saw fish this weekend after
your, while you're listening to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm forgetful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to need some, some pep talks in
the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: Remind me.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get back to the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, since it's illegal to cross state
boundaries with legally purchased Colorado
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana, does Griego and his staff
inform these consumers says customer,
[SPEAKER_03]: sorry about that very serious state law.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's where I have the problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: This person that I got to try that cream
was very vocal inside the store and asking
[SPEAKER_04]: where she could take hearsay product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Since it was high in CBD, just product
into your, in general.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he, after informing him, after
informing her three times, he kind of got
[SPEAKER_04]: like, Hey, can we stop saying anything
about taking it where you're not supposed
[SPEAKER_04]: to?
[SPEAKER_04]: We've already said it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So guys, when you come to Colorado,
what Adam's kind of eluding to is have
[SPEAKER_03]: some class, be careful what you say in the
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the answer is no.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're thinking, can I put this in my
car and go back to Texas?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I put this in my suitcase and fly back
to California?
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe, maybe you're not allowed to take
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's amnesty boxes in the airport.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even there is ways to pack it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're a medical marijuana patient
in California and you're flying,
[SPEAKER_03]: figure that one out for yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to encourage that,
but you're not supposed to, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_03]: leave all the medical states out of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the, no, you're not supposed to leave
Colorado with Colorado marijuana products.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're really not supposed to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I shouldn't encourage it in any way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if you're going to California,
if you're going to fucking Washington,
[SPEAKER_04]: there is forms and laws and procedures.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I've seen people, you know,
for cups bring right, it's substantial
[SPEAKER_04]: amounts just in their, in their backpacks,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is forms and procedures.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go through that if you really want to do
it, but you're not going to be like,
[SPEAKER_04]: can I bring my quarter home to Kentucky?
No.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you shop at dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy says, when people come in,
we're all about safety and state
[SPEAKER_03]: compliance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we make sure that the out of state
consumers are aware that they're,
[SPEAKER_03]: it says that, are aware that they're
purchasing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is written weird, but it says there
is for in-state consumption only.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also remind them that they can't do
it in public.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do the shops remind you of that stuff when
you're there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you have an out of state ID.
[SPEAKER_04]: A few of them have, not all of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just really depends on how busy,
you know, if they're having a slow day,
[SPEAKER_04]: they'll chat chat you up a little bit,
but if there's 10 people in the waiting
[SPEAKER_04]: room, they're not, they're, they're not
informing you of nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're what you, what you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: How much?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can buy this much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to buy this much?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it really is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the recreational shops,
the pre-rolls are actually just shake and
[SPEAKER_03]: bullshit and you don't want it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know if bullshit counts on the
cuss jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just said bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that count in the cuss jar?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that fair?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the F word.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, check out the can of sewer in this
picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have, I'm not, I don't endorse any
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I'm not paid.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sponsored by any dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't shop at most dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this picture, the picture of the can
of sewer here has a picture of their,
[SPEAKER_03]: got a window cut out and you can see into
their grow room.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, if you are from another state and you
want to see a pretty stylish looking grow
[SPEAKER_03]: room, check that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know anything about their product.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks cool in this picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, like I said, I don't know what
their product is like.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go in there and they sell you,
Hey, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_03]: So,
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody looks like I may be right about
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can say that on my show.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're allowed to have an opinion,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Out of five stars, how many?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never been there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't want to give any rating.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've just heard stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard a lot of stories as well from
about a lot of the shops here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a med patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: 80% of our customers are coming from out
of state.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's a good article there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you guys would be interested.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's click over back to the recording and
see how many hours we've gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're at 30 minutes here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to squeeze in some more stuff,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I sent an email to Jody Emery asking if
I'm allowed to play parts of a Mark Emery
[SPEAKER_03]: video on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I am, I plan to play a little bit
of Mark's speech that he gave recently
[SPEAKER_03]: after he was released from federal prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I look forward to doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need a drink.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_03]: One second.
[SPEAKER_03]: Adam, say something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I watched this and actually linked it to
him.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a powerful motivating speech.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is on the ball.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if he does get the permission to do
it, I won't ruin it for you, but everybody
[SPEAKER_04]: should watch it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it does inspire you to get up off
your feet- Do you want to take a risk and
[SPEAKER_03]: just play some of it?
[SPEAKER_04]: We can, or we can just talk kind of what
it's about.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really want to talk what it's
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like being innovative.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's- The audio, I don't think we'll be
in trouble for.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as we don't play video or
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's click over here and pause the music.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I think I'm going to play a
little bit of this video.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't prepared to do it, but we're
talking about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it seems like the thing to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you kind of play towards the end of it,
it would kind of relay the message more of
[SPEAKER_04]: it, unless you want to play the whole
video later on.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about I'll play a couple of intro
seconds when he takes the mic.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was introduced at one point and he
brought his friend back on stage to-
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good part.
[SPEAKER_03]: He gets introduced.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark Emery is introduced by somebody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark Emery comes on stage and gives thanks
to another friend and hands the mic to
[SPEAKER_03]: him.
[SPEAKER_03]: That guy talks for about eight minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Mark Emery comes back on stage
and starts his little, not little,
[SPEAKER_03]: his big speech.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll start with, it's about 10 minutes
and 25 seconds into the video.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll start there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to give a shout out to the
YouTube page that I'm playing it from.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to be polite here.
[SPEAKER_03]: These guys are- I asked for permission.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't gotten the email back saying yes
or no yet, but they're busy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like they'd let me do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's Jodie Emery.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why wouldn't she want Mark's preach the
word?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's coming from PotTV on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on Cannabis Culture's website.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to all those guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So please I subscribe to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I beg for your forgiveness if I wasn't
supposed to do this, but I'm sure you'd
[SPEAKER_03]: want this message out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll play a few seconds of it
and then we'll find out if we can play a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we can play a bunch, we'll go ahead
and play a couple of minutes of it for
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys, I'm going to take a drink.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll start off this Mark Emery video.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was kind of a weird transition here
that randomly happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Mark Emery right after he,
I think he's like 48 hours out of prison
[SPEAKER_03]: when he did this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like 48, something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, so here it goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to click play and I will have to
adjust the sound while it goes on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll figure it out on the fly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun to be me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I even said that while I was in prison
because, you know, doing something,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's almost use the word noble,
doing something on principle late,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, giving a good chunk of your life
in sacrifice, I guess for principle,
[SPEAKER_00]: even in prison was highly regarded.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in the four and a half years I
was in prison, I really never heard an
[SPEAKER_00]: unkind word spoken to me by any inmate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was in a meeting in security prison
for almost all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of these people are serving life
imprisonment without parole.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've come down from the penitentiary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're covered in tattoos.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're bad ass dudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them, or at least they think they
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're serving horribly long
sentences by and large for drugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly methamphetamine crack cocaine,
but certainly there were many,
[SPEAKER_00]: many people there for marijuana serving
10, 15, and even in one case, 25 years for
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was able to be very productive in
jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I blogged.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read a book every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had 25 magazine subscriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the New York Times every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned how to play the bass guitar and
was in an outstanding rock and roll band
[SPEAKER_00]: of incredibly talented musicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of them were very patient in
teaching me at no charge for anything,
[SPEAKER_00]: music and music principles and how to be a
bass guitarist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I must tell you that it was a very
redemptive and meaningful experience being
[SPEAKER_00]: in prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope I always carry the message
forward that I saw there that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it is a very wrong society that
punishes people for drugs and puts them in
[SPEAKER_00]: jail for decades and takes them away from
their family and their children and
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially ruins their life because of a
lifestyle choice they made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we manufacture crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the drug laws, we actually- All
right, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark Emery can talk for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to kind of fade out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Adam's telling me that I should play this
stuff at the end of the video because it's
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot more moving and compelling.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to save that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to tease it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to make sure that I can get
permission.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was about a minute and a half there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope I don't get in any kind of trouble.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they take down this episode,
I apologize.
[SPEAKER_03]: All it was was some news and a Mark Emery
rant anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'll just cut that out and we'll fix
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go watch the video.
[SPEAKER_04]: The message after he gets through this,
what I did in jail stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I mean, that's moving, trust me.
[SPEAKER_04]: But his message towards the end is
definitely what you need to hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's what we need to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So take the video, take 30 minutes and
watch it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, if they let me- Whoa, that was loud.
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they let me play that, I'll play the
last few minutes at the end of this show
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to wait for the email.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to be respectful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I don't get the email by the time I
post the episode, then I won't do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in Denver, part of this article,
I'm going to kind of paraphrase it because
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a lot of stuff and the episode's
getting long already.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a couple more things I want to read
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is from the Cannabis also.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was actually published August 12th.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's by Alida Laback from the Cannabis
staff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't say that right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure, but I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one is, so governor Hickenlooper,
John Hickenlooper placed these giant cages
[SPEAKER_03]: around places in Denver.
[SPEAKER_03]: He put one in front of a skate park.
[SPEAKER_03]: He put one in front of a library in
Denver, the Denver public library.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're big cages that look like your
hamster cage, and they call it a lab rat
[SPEAKER_03]: cage.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lab rat cage that says,
don't be a lab rat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the inside, it's got a little thing
that tells you about cannabis and the
[SPEAKER_03]: problems that cannabis can cause you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's saying, don't be a lab rat to
cannabis to encourage kids to not smoke
[SPEAKER_03]: weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you put a big 12 foot tall lab
rat looking cage with a giant cage,
[SPEAKER_03]: it looks like those water bottles that
hang upside down that your hamster licks
[SPEAKER_03]: to get water.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's got a little green thing on
the outside that talks about cannabis on
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little note.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to come around on the side of
the computer, bro, and take a look,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's definitely worth looking at.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks just like a people cage for
hamsters or a hamster cage for peoples.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a people cage.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a people cage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the article says, well,
that didn't take long.
[SPEAKER_03]: The state of Colorado debuted its don't be
a lab rat youth campaign on Monday,
[SPEAKER_03]: August 11th by dropping human size
laboratory cages around the Denver area,
[SPEAKER_03]: including outside the Denver public
library and the downtown skate park.
[SPEAKER_03]: Vandalized signs at the skate park
installation were reported Monday evening
[SPEAKER_03]: by CBS 4.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cages feature posters that cite
controversial marijuana research studies
[SPEAKER_03]: and ask open-ended questions about youth
pot use.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, that was a hard sentence.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some cleverly crossed out a reference to
negative effects of marijuana and changed
[SPEAKER_03]: it to positive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although another message left on the
poster says critically smoking weed saved
[SPEAKER_03]: my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: The campaign, which targets teens with
messages that marijuana research is
[SPEAKER_03]: ongoing, particularly in studies of
studies of the developed developing brain
[SPEAKER_03]: is trying a different tact from the just
say no anti-drug campaigns of yore.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a few variations of the posters
that adorn the giant cages.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a new message is sure to replace the
vandalized signs.
[SPEAKER_03]: The vandalism was taken in stride by Dr.
Larry Wolk, who leads the state health
[SPEAKER_03]: department.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they are defacing it or they're doing
something with regard to graffiti or
[SPEAKER_03]: gathering in the cages, at least they're
taking notice and let the debate occur.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're probably just breaking that shit
while they're smoking a joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: To be perfectly honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was also the man who talked up
inside the cage at the skate park,
[SPEAKER_03]: according to the TV station report.
[SPEAKER_04]: So somebody was.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I think it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just marijuana activists.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's Denver, you know,
it's not like there's not enough of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, obviously people got off their
ass and signed, you know, enough papers
[SPEAKER_04]: that it's legal here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the $2 million project,
which includes a stylized website is
[SPEAKER_03]: funded by a grand by a grant paid by legal
sediments with settlements with various
[SPEAKER_03]: pharmaceutical companies, according to the
governor's office.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another component of the don't be a lab
rat lab rat campaign are the TV ads as
[SPEAKER_03]: seen below.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going to watch these stupid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where does big pharma get off by telling
you not to be a lab rat?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they need, they need your money.
I get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want you on Zoloft instead of weed,
but dude.
Yup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, uh, these, most of our listeners
probably haven't seen these gigantic lab
[SPEAKER_03]: rat cages.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's quite entertaining.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've posted their three or four stories
on the cannabis about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were down there the other day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have liked to go, you know,
that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should have gone and checked it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, if you want to jump around on this
side again, and take a look, there's
[SPEAKER_03]: actually people inside of this one as they
were building it or I'll move the email
[SPEAKER_03]: out of the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a, that's the people cage they're
working with right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's essentially a lion cage from the zoo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a lion.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like a lion cage.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like a large cat, small
enclosure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that 10 by 10 by 10 by 10 by 10?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then I don't even think it's at,
it's probably 12 by 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably longer than it is wider,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and there's a lot of scrutiny about
how kind of ridiculous it is to,
[SPEAKER_03]: from a lot of people by the looks of these
websites.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me click and see how long we're
going.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to keep moving on with that
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are about 40 minutes in, so we can keep
going.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a couple, we can make this a
perfect hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet if we do this, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll try to save a couple of minutes for
the, uh, the Mark Emory part.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we get a chance to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is something random.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm reading this because this supports the
legalization, the nationwide legalization
[SPEAKER_03]: and decriminalization of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: The headline will say it all for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: New Hampshire declares state of emergency
over spice.
[SPEAKER_03]: No shit, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how to cure that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let us just smoke the weed we want to
smoke instead of having to smoke fake
[SPEAKER_04]: spice.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of that is probation and,
and jobs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probation and prohibition and job testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I, I, I had personal experience
with this where people were like,
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, it's better than sex, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta, I've never, and I was like,
all right, whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And dude, I will never again.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was in the toilet for six hours,
like hacking my lungs up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Felt like a piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't ever smoke spice.
[SPEAKER_03]: The guys that listen to my show won't
smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Adam will try anything twice.
[SPEAKER_03]: He only did spice once.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to read some of the,
it doesn't even seem like we need this
[SPEAKER_03]: gets the point across, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't fucking legalize.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, I just said, fuck somebody tweet
me and tell me to quit doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's offensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a terrible word.
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta quit doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of obvious legalized cannabis
and we won't have to smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: They won't have to smoke spice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Employers and probation, some probation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't drink alcohol, but employers
don't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go out at five o'clock or six o
'clock, or if you go down to panic hour at
[SPEAKER_03]: six 15 and drink 22 beers, your employer
doesn't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you smoke a fat joint, man,
you might get fired from your job,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is terrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll read part of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Governor Maggie Hassan has declared a
state of emergency to allow public health
[SPEAKER_03]: officials to investigate and quarantine
synthetic drugs linked to recent overdoses
[SPEAKER_03]: in Manchester and Concord.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is New Hampshire, by the way,
authorities say at least 41 people in the
[SPEAKER_03]: Manchester area have experienced serious
medical reactions to synthetic
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids known as spice that are
chemically engineered substances similar
[SPEAKER_03]: to the actual active ingredient in
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's scrutinize this sentence just for
fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Synthetic cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that that's what that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's poser pot known as spice that are
chemically engineered substances.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's close I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Active ingredient in marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: Marijuana doesn't have ingredients.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a compound I think is what you'd want
to call it there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So come on guys, you're the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bra cannabis properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you even cannabis, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: Concord police have reported at least
three cases since Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hassan's declaration gives the State
Department of Health and Human Services
[SPEAKER_03]: the power to investigate quarantine and
require the destruction of the products.
[SPEAKER_03]: She says the department will work with the
police to quarantine the bubblegum flavor
[SPEAKER_03]: of a product named smacked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Such products are labeled as herbal
incense, but are known to be smoked or
[SPEAKER_03]: brewed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who wants to take a product called
smacked?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I might take a dab of a
strain called smacked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but not of spice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, people have been doing this for
years, but they put them in boilers and
[SPEAKER_04]: use them in rooms, you know, like large
rooms to give everybody that kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: feeling.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Frankincense and myrrh has been used for
years, but they never grabbed it and put
[SPEAKER_04]: it in the bong.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, yeah, let's get baked.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they had herb for that because it
wasn't against the law then, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it wasn't all around the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still looked at as something crazy
and they, people are going to try to get
[SPEAKER_04]: it one way or the other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's some decently uplifting news.
[SPEAKER_03]: Utah medical marijuana program,
11 cards issued, several for child
[SPEAKER_03]: patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is by Michelle L.
[SPEAKER_03]: Price of the Associated Press in Salt Lake
City.
[SPEAKER_03]: Utah issued nearly a dozen registration
cards in the first month of its limited
[SPEAKER_03]: medical marijuana program that allows
those with severe epilepsy to possess
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis extract oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was August 9th, so this is kind of
old news, but I just wanted to put out
[SPEAKER_03]: some news and catch up.
[SPEAKER_03]: As of Friday evening, the state has issued
11 cards since the program started July
[SPEAKER_03]: 8th, said Janice Houston, the state
registrar and director of the Utah
[SPEAKER_03]: Department of Health Records Office.
[SPEAKER_03]: About half of those 11 cards were issued
for child patients, Houston.
[SPEAKER_03]: Houston said an application for another
card is pending.
[SPEAKER_03]: Health Department officials on Friday also
announced the $400 annual fee for the
[SPEAKER_03]: cards had been cut in half.
[SPEAKER_03]: The program startup fee were less than
expected and the registration cards will
[SPEAKER_03]: now cost $200, Houston said.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, there are 11 cards and one more
being applied for in the state of Utah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was at a party the other night and there
were probably 11 medical marijuana cards
[SPEAKER_03]: in the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a huge relief, said Jennifer May with
hope for children with epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been trying to find ways to help the
families come up with that money along
[SPEAKER_03]: with the money for the oil itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those who already paid the higher fee will
be refunded, health officials said.
[SPEAKER_03]: Utah's law doesn't allow the distribution
of medical marijuana, but it permits those
[SPEAKER_03]: meeting certain requirements to possess
the extract after getting it from other
[SPEAKER_03]: states.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they can at least get what they need to
from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a step in the right direction,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_03]: The extract called cannabidiol is believed
to help with severe seizures, particularly
[SPEAKER_03]: those experienced by children with a
severe form of epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Georgia is also looking at that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Close guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice try.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not an extract called cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabidiol is a cannabinoid, but one of
the cannabinoids in the extract,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I see what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice try guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've fucked me up a couple of times in
this article.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the oil doesn't have the psychoactive
properties that gets users high and can be
[SPEAKER_03]: mixed with foods such as applesauce.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if they'd be able to bring back
the OG caps, because those OG caps from
[SPEAKER_03]: essential extracts available at Natural
Mystic Cannabis Caregivers, which is a
[SPEAKER_03]: medical shop.
Man.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're going to have to get a Colorado
residency and get a medical marijuana cart
[SPEAKER_03]: in Colorado to even acquire this type of
medicine to get it to Utah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe not in Dipper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe there's something a little more-
Yeah, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nowadays.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll keep going.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cost of cannabidiol varies depending
on the size of the patient and the level
[SPEAKER_03]: of the dose the patient is receiving.
[SPEAKER_03]: For a hundred pound person, a month's
supply, of a beginning dose is about 40
[SPEAKER_03]: bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: A maximum dose for the same patient could
cost up to $900 a month.
[SPEAKER_03]: What they are talking about seems to be
Phoenix tears, Rick Simpson oil,
[SPEAKER_03]: full plant cannabis extract, full extract
cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's orally eaten.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's black usually or greenish colored.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not talking about dads or
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's basically Rick Simpson oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys are familiar with that,
there's a movie called Run From the Cure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe is what it's called.
[SPEAKER_03]: Race for the Cure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Run From the Cure, the Rick Simpson
story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Search for the name Rick Simpson and then
put cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll find the movie I'm talking
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Learn about Rick Simpson oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people say Rick Simpson may have
stolen that recipe and gotten famous off
[SPEAKER_03]: of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's helping a lot of people do your
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out Rick Simpson.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just did a give thanks section on
accident.
[SPEAKER_03]: The main producer of the extract in
Colorado has a waiting list with thousands
[SPEAKER_03]: of names and doesn't expect to have more
supply until fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: And other producers of the product also
have a waiting list.
[SPEAKER_03]: May said, because Utah's registration
cards expire year after year, many
[SPEAKER_03]: families are expected to apply later this
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: About 100 families are expected to take
advantage of Utah's program, health
[SPEAKER_03]: department officials said.
[SPEAKER_03]: May, whose 12-year-old son can suffer
hundreds of seizures a day, said she and
[SPEAKER_03]: many other families are also waiting to
see if they can secure a spot in a pending
[SPEAKER_03]: drug trial by neurologists at Primary
Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once families receive a registration card,
they can face additional hurdles to
[SPEAKER_03]: actually get the extract from other
states, including enrolling in that
[SPEAKER_03]: state's medical marijuana program.
[SPEAKER_03]: All state marijuana programs, medical or
otherwise, are still illegal under federal
[SPEAKER_03]: law.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some doctors and advocacy groups have
warned there's no proof the extract is
[SPEAKER_03]: effective at treating epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But families say it's worth the time and
cost if it brings relief to those
[SPEAKER_03]: suffering from seizures.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think these people are gonna pay
$400 or now $200 to get the medical
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana card that they received to
acquire and then go spend money in another
[SPEAKER_03]: state?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're gonna travel to Colorado to get
this oil that costs up to $900 for a
[SPEAKER_03]: freaking dose, a month dose.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're gonna drive from Colorado to Utah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're gonna spend a couple of hundred
bucks in gas.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're gonna spend a day away.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're probably traveling with a child
with seizures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they gonna waste, and excuse this one,
are they gonna waste that fucking time if
[SPEAKER_03]: this medicine doesn't work?
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're just, no, there must be
something working, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's that documentary that I linked you
not that long ago that literally you watch
[SPEAKER_04]: these people uproot their life.
[SPEAKER_04]: They come out here and they try it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty sure I've seen that one,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then they go back to their home state and
their home state's giving them a point
[SPEAKER_04]: zero or zero point something CBD value.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they had to uproot their lives and
move to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's a million stories like it
all over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Throw a stone here and you can pretty much
find what they're calling the marijuana
[SPEAKER_04]: refugees.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's hard, man, and absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: This dude, the story you just read said
half the people we get are coming from out
[SPEAKER_04]: of state.
[SPEAKER_04]: So why would people not come here to help
their children that is in desperate need?
[SPEAKER_03]: People are packing up their entire lives
and moving to another state because we can
[SPEAKER_03]: offer them a medicine that is obviously
working.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not gonna say it's gonna work for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the union was the first time I ever
saw that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a guy that he's all shaky and I
don't mean to be rude about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's really shaky and they smoked and it
was gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: He goes right back to not shaky.
[SPEAKER_03]: So while we got time for one more quick
news article, Seattle pot tickets,
[SPEAKER_03]: one cop wrote 80% of citations.
[SPEAKER_04]: What were they calling that one guy out
there in California when it really boomed?
[SPEAKER_04]: There was, there was one dude out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know who I'm talking to that was just
standing outside of pot shops,
[SPEAKER_04]: like writing people's citations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't remember his name,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is from Seattle.
[SPEAKER_03]: A Seattle police officer has been
reassigned after a review found he wrote
[SPEAKER_03]: about 80% of marijuana tickets issued in
the city during the first half of 2014.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seattle police chief Kathleen O'Toole said
July 30 on the department website that the
[SPEAKER_03]: unidentified officer issued 66 of the 83
citations for public pot use in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_03]: She says that in some cases he added notes
to the tickets or address them to Seattle
[SPEAKER_03]: city attorney Pete Holmes.
[SPEAKER_03]: In other case, the officer reportedly said
he flipped a coin when deciding which
[SPEAKER_03]: person to cite.
[SPEAKER_03]: O'Toole says the officer also wrote on the
voter approved state initiative legalizing
[SPEAKER_03]: recreational marijuana was silly.
[SPEAKER_03]: The police chief said that the case has
been referred to the department's official
[SPEAKER_03]: of professional accountability.
[SPEAKER_03]: She says the officer won't be on patrol
duties during the investigation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, big middle finger to that cop.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I got to say about that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just hating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let some people smoke some weed,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't know their story.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they had something crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe weed killed their dad or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess if that had ever happened,
you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd never killed anybody, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that, but I'm just saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only way that you can be killed by
marijuana, the only way you can be killed
[SPEAKER_03]: by cannabis is if a bunch of it falls off.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it falls on top of you or if a cop
beats you up for having it in your pocket.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe her dad got crushed by thousands of
tons of weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine that stinky death.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's got a lighter would all be you're
thinking about just burn this on top of
[SPEAKER_03]: me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing, nothing horrible.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying like he smoked a joint and
died.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm saying that I'm just going
to wrap that part of this talk up.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, guys, we have gone,
uh, we're pretty close to an hour now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, I'm not sure if they are going to
let me play more of that Mark Emory video.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they do, it'll happen here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's, that's, if you'd have told
me, Mark, you're going to spend the next
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 years, you know, smoking joints and
bongs and selling seeds, and you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to go to jail for many, many years of your
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one day after 25 years of you being
arrested, have you gone to jail?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you been taken away?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you losing all your assets?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you been separated from your family
and your wife?
[SPEAKER_00]: After all that, you're going to have one
day, one day in 2015, and if you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: your people together, it all ends on that
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that day, the next day after that day,
the stores will start selling marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: People will walk the streets confident
about the marijuana in their pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to get arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be medical marijuana science
experiments and advancements every day
[SPEAKER_00]: after that, because it'll be legal to
study marijuana in universities.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be legal for doctors to recommend
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be legal for doctors, judges,
cops, politicians to smoke it and share it
[SPEAKER_00]: and understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be legal to go and buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be legal for ordinary people to grow
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be legal for people to have a
business that grows marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be legal for everybody to make
vaporizes and bongs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the books and magazines about
marijuana will all be legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one will ever try and ban them ever
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one will ever say a bad thing about pot
smokers as a culture, as a way of
[SPEAKER_00]: demonizing them and sending them to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, Mark, in 25 years, that one day,
everybody showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a happy, wonderful world ever
since, because everybody showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my message.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a big opportunity coming in 14
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be touring the country
relentlessly, telling everybody,
[SPEAKER_00]: even in other countries, you just need one
day where everybody we know who smokes pot
[SPEAKER_00]: shows up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be my message in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be my message in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be my message in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be my message in Vienna.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a message all across
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's certainly my message to all
Americans who go to vote in Oregon and
[SPEAKER_00]: Alaska and Florida and Washington District
of Columbia on the first Tuesday in
[SPEAKER_00]: November.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you show up, you'll never need to think
about this ever again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll just be allowed to enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be allowed to be part of a culture
that ought to be one of the most respected
[SPEAKER_00]: cultures in the history of mankind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'll tell you this, the cannabis
culture has given more to humanity and
[SPEAKER_00]: mankind, humankind in science and
entertainment and theater and arts,
[SPEAKER_00]: books and culture, and especially in
music, than any other culture of the last
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis culture is one of the
greatest cultures in the history of
[SPEAKER_00]: mankind, starting with William
Shakespeare, who smoked marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so many great poets and writers
and musicians and scientists and doctors
[SPEAKER_00]: and explorers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to this day, our movers and shakers,
spill jobs, or sorry, Bill Gates,
[SPEAKER_00]: Stephen Jobs, pot smokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Carl Sagan, pot smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every musician you've ever cared to really
enjoy a pot smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the people who write today's great
bestsellers and make today's great movies
[SPEAKER_00]: are pot smokers, including actors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a great culture, but we've been
denied our official right to be regarded
[SPEAKER_00]: as first-class citizens like everybody
else who makes contributions and who ought
[SPEAKER_00]: to be acknowledged as a culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if they'd have told me 25 years
ago, Mark, it's going to be a long road
[SPEAKER_00]: with a lot of difficulties, but one day in
2015, one day it all becomes real if you
[SPEAKER_00]: can get your people to show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to partying with you
tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, guys, that was Mark Emery.
[SPEAKER_03]: That video came from the PotTV YouTube
channel.

in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just try to get them closer to an
hour.
