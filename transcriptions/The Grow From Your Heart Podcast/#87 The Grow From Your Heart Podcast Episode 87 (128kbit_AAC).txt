[SPEAKER_00]: Alright guys, I wanna give a huge shout
out to my friend Fred Garvin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna turn this music down just a
little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna give a huge shout out to Fred
Garvin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I posted something to Facebook and Fred
politely commented saying, hey Jeff,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've been doing a great job,
but you've kinda strayed away from the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he asked for more grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fred, I can't agree with you more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have strayed away from the grow lessons
that I've tried to provide you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been so much great news.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that all of the news has been
great, but there's been so much important
[SPEAKER_00]: news that I felt like it's been my job to
bring that news to the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have gotten a little bit away from the
grow lessons and I got a lot into the
[SPEAKER_00]: news, but you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna get back into grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of this will be a little bit about
grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next episode is going to be
about pH, which is all about growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Fred, you're totally correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will fix that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get back to the grow lessons,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get that far, I know I just
said we're gonna get back into grow
[SPEAKER_00]: lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And get away from the news, but I've
already had this episode planned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're gonna have to bear with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, there's a very important news
article that I wanna read to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thumbing through my computer here
trying to find it now to tell you the
[SPEAKER_00]: truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're gonna get right to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This news article comes from The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found this very important since I have
recently taken over as the lead grower at
[SPEAKER_00]: the Spot Dispensary in Pueblo West,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I am running a large facility,
things like this really stand out to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get right to the article,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was written by Kristen Wyatt of the
Associated Press.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline is, unknown's abound in
pesticide use for growing pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the sub headline says, there is no
federal agency that will recognize this as
[SPEAKER_00]: a legitimate crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pest management information regarding this
crop evolves to internet chats and
[SPEAKER_00]: hearsay, says Whitney Cranshaw,
a Colorado state university entomologist
[SPEAKER_00]: and pesticide expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously this is going to be about
pesticides and bugs and cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the article goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys have ever grown any cannabis,
you'll know that the number one obstacle
[SPEAKER_00]: can be bugs for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once bugs show up, it is hard as hell to
get rid of bugs in a grow room if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not experienced and if you don't know what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, As legal marijuana moves from
basements and backwoods to warehouses and
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial fields, the mold and spider
mites that once ruined only a few plants
[SPEAKER_00]: at a time can now quickly create a
multimillion dollar crisis for growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some returning to industrial strength
chemicals, raising concerns about safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say multimillion dollar crisis for
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not kidding you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The facility that I am working in,
that I am helping them finish build,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have four flowering rooms and one of
those rooms has 26 Gavita lights hanging
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our projections are almost anybody's goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing with a Gavita,
your goal is two pounds per light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's 52 projected pounds of cannabis
coming out of that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't really tell you what the going
rate is for a pound of cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado right now at a retail center or
being sold from retail to retail center,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that is quite an investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were to fuck up 52 pounds of weed,
that would really cost us quite a bit of
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would not make the money we planned on
making.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a bummer in the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can't pay the bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're short money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you don't have product on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would cause a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously you can see how one 52 pound
harvest could really cause a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got all the wasted time
and the wasted plants because the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: cost money.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the wasted nutrients, all the wasted
electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could really add up quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to continue the article here
where I was, it says, herbicides and
[SPEAKER_00]: insecticides are regulated by the federal
government, which still regards almost all
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana as an illicit crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no roadmap to help pot farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemists and horticulturalists can't offer
much assistance either.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sometimes disagree about how to
combat the problem, largely because the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is used in many different ways,
smoked, eaten, and sometimes rubbed into
[SPEAKER_00]: the skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an industry that's been illegal
for so many years that there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing, said Frank Conrad,
lab director of Colorado Green Lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: a pot testing lab in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: In states that regulate marijuana,
officials are just starting to draft rules
[SPEAKER_00]: governing safe levels of chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, there have been no reports on any
human illness, trace two chemicals used on
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana, but worries do persist.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city of Denver this spring quarantined
tens of thousands of marijuana plants at
[SPEAKER_00]: 11 growing facilities after health
inspectors suspected use of unauthorized
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the plants were later released
after tests revealed the pot was safe,
[SPEAKER_00]: but two producers voluntarily destroyed
their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, there was about 600 pounds of
cannabis voluntarily destroyed because of
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: The article says eight businesses still
have at least some plants in quarantine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The article goes on to say, In Oregon,
a June investigation by the Oregonian
[SPEAKER_00]: newspaper found pesticides in excess of
legal limits on products ranging from
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana buds to concentrated marijuana
oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other pesticides detected on the marijuana
are not regulated by Oregon's marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: rules, meaning that products containing
those chemicals still can be sold there.
[SPEAKER_00]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Environmental Protection Agency,
which decides which pesticides can be used
[SPEAKER_00]: on which crops, just said last month that
Colorado and Washington authorities that
[SPEAKER_00]: they could apply to have some cannabis
related chemicals approved through what's
[SPEAKER_00]: called a special local need registration,
but that process could take years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks like we're on our way,
but it could take years, it says here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, Colorado and Oregon
require retail marijuana to undergo
[SPEAKER_00]: testing for pesticides and other
contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as the Oregon investigation showed,
the testing regimes are imperfect and
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado hasn't yet implemented
requirements for retail pot to undergo
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide testing because of regulatory
delays.
[SPEAKER_00]: There aren't any labs here that will test
for it yet, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington state is still working on its
pesticide rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nation's largest marijuana producer,
California, has no regulations at all for
[SPEAKER_00]: growing commercial pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, up until this industry got
hugely popular on a recreational and legal
[SPEAKER_00]: level, the guidelines and the people who
were responsible for quality control were
[SPEAKER_00]: the growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were the ones responsible for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an art.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was something that we were proud of.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would not let out a product that had
been sprayed with some bullshit or a
[SPEAKER_00]: product that had powdery mildew on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were the ones who were responsible for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And took that responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that it's so commercially popular
and everybody's buying and growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: selling cannabis, the art and the love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I hope you guys heard that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was some amazing thunder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's finally raining.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've needed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was my responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that it's so popular, everyone's
worried about the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've gotten away from the art and the
pride, and they're just doing whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: they can do to get plants on the ground,
pounds out the door and money in the cash
[SPEAKER_00]: register and customers out the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not really what it's about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since people have lost the heart,
they're not growing from their heart like
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to teach them to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to come up with some sort of
testing and we have to create rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says it's a lot more difficult than
it sounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington Liquor Board Washington Liquor
Control Board spokesman Brian Smith said
[SPEAKER_00]: about testing for pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, unscrupulous pot growers can
use banned chemicals with little chance of
[SPEAKER_00]: being caught.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were taken by surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: This whole pesticide taken by surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: This whole pesticide issue, said Ashley
Kilroy, Denver's director of marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was talking to a room of about 200 pot
industry workers who invited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet it doesn't it's missing a word
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Invited lunch after the invited to a lunch
maybe earlier this month to learn about
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide quarantines and rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, they skipped a word in this article
and it totally threw me off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just says invited lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the growers heard wasn't encouraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no federal agency that will
recognize this as a legitimate crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: said Whitney Crenshaw, a Colorado State
University entomologist and pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regulators just bury their heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, pest management
information regarding this crop devolves
[SPEAKER_00]: to Internet chats and hearsay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys don't want to go start
reading about how to battle bugs or
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew on a large scale on the
Internet because there's so much bullshit
[SPEAKER_00]: that you'll have to feed through that if
you don't have a good base knowledge,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll just confuse you and mess you up
even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So marijuana growers are indeed guessing
when they treat their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, one of the chemicals cited in
Denver quarantines, a fungicide called
[SPEAKER_00]: Eagle 20 is commonly used on grapes and
hops, but can become dangerous when heated
[SPEAKER_00]: and is banned for use on tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: No research exists on whether the
fungicide is safe for use on pot that will
[SPEAKER_00]: be eaten.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, something I've read recently about
exactly Eagle 20 is Eagle 20 gets inside
[SPEAKER_00]: of OK, it goes in the plant is what it
does and it stops the plant from producing
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew and it can last for 60 to
90 days in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a little crazy if you understand
the plant biology there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also what I've read is if it gets on
your skin, it absorbs into your skin and
[SPEAKER_00]: it changes your RNA and you won't notice
it because you might not live long enough
[SPEAKER_00]: to even notice the changes that occurred
in your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: But your grandchildren will be affected by
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your grandchildren will have birth
defects, attention deficit disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't guarantee they will.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is what this type of chemical
does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't fuck you up, but it messes you
up in the insides to where your kids kids
[SPEAKER_00]: are messed up, which is that's got to be
some serious dangerous shit that I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to mess with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want sprayed on my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want sprayed on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll keep going here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several pot growers interviewed by the
Associated Press agreed that research is
[SPEAKER_00]: needed on pesticides for pot, but they
pointed out that pesticides are widely
[SPEAKER_00]: used on food crops and that weed consumers
have never before had as much information
[SPEAKER_00]: about the marijuana they buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like broccoli or spinach or
peaches or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is susceptible to certain pests,
said Gabriel Fairforth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I said that right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fairworth, anyway, who is cultivation
manager of Denver's herbal remedies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for butchering your name
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fairworth does not use any banned
chemicals on his plants and was not
[SPEAKER_00]: affected by the quarantines, but he
questioned some of the banned chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have all these chemicals that are
safe on products you eat, but you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: use them on marijuana, I don't know that I
agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The founder of the nation's oldest
marijuana legalization advocacy group,
[SPEAKER_00]: Keith Straup of the normal organization,
National Organization for the Reform of
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana Laws, pointed out that
regulators today are at least starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at marijuana safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the 1980s, the federal government used
an herbicide called Paraquat to kill
[SPEAKER_00]: illicit marijuana crops, even though the
poison had been banned from national
[SPEAKER_00]: forests because of environmental concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normal complained to the White House that
some of the weed survived and was turning
[SPEAKER_00]: up on the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: The response was, it's illegal and we
don't have any obligation not to poison
[SPEAKER_00]: it, Straup recalled.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one was taking us seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is kind of sick that they poisoned
this weed, the weed made it to the street,
[SPEAKER_00]: and when they said, hey, this weed's out
there, they went, not our problem,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro, it's illegal, don't fuck with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tough love from the government right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recent actions by states with legal weed
have been encouraging, if slow,
[SPEAKER_00]: he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea that it's been on the black
market and people are fine, so therefore
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't need testing is absurd,
Straup said.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one would want to be using a product
that has molds or pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wants to smoke a product that has
mold or pesticides in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you even want to put that into your
body?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you want to put that in your pipe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you, as a grower, why would you
want to put that out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would you act like you're proud?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would you even sell that to somebody?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just weirdness to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that article came from, I'm scrolling
back up to remember her name, it is
[SPEAKER_00]: Kristen Wyatt from the Associated Press.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I got to clear my throat here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me take a quick drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I needed a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so as a grower, I find it kind
of wrong that people would even spray some
[SPEAKER_00]: of this shit on their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't use anything that is not
completely organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, I avoid using sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since I work at a grow and I go to a
lot of grows, I know that I'm putting
[SPEAKER_00]: myself at risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need some sort of safety net.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do use products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to use too much neem oil because
neem oil will definitely affect the flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: of my extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are certain things that I'll use,
certain things that I won't use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've definitely been talking about
what we will and won't use at the shop
[SPEAKER_00]: because there are things that we
definitely do not want to put in our crop
[SPEAKER_00]: at the shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think if you guys are going to grow
weed or cannabis or pot or whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to call it, think about who's going
to consume the products that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our goal is to make people feel better and
not give them cancer or lung disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't spray some shit on your plants
that's going to give somebody cancer or
lung disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't spray anything on your plants that
you wouldn't spray on your produce and
[SPEAKER_00]: then eat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that should be our new guideline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also you guys think about what would
happen if we gave some contaminated
[SPEAKER_00]: products to a person with a compromised
immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a caregiver and one of my favorite
patients, I'm a medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: caregiver, which means I am responsible
for growing a few people's medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got a patient, his name is Doug
and Doug's an older dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's over 50 years old and he's not in
good health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I've known him, he's had three or
four major health problems in just the few
[SPEAKER_00]: years that I've known him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow medical cannabis for Doug to make
Doug feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow medical cannabis for Doug to help
Doug live longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to improve Doug's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm mixing up nutrients and reading
the back of a nutrient bottle,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of thinking about Doug's lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking about Doug's heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking about Doug's kidneys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking about Doug's high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking about Doug because I don't
want to kill Doug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make Doug feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I see powdery mildew in a crop,
I cut the crop down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I clean the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start over and figure out why I got
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have to spray some shit on there,
I think about Doug before I apply
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read, I research, I try to be good to
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to be good to Doug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to be good to anybody else that's
going to smoke this stuff or eat this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff or make hash out of this stuff
because it's going into a sick person's
[SPEAKER_00]: body and we don't want to kill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make them feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people, I wrote this down,
a lot of people are going to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: excuse that they didn't know they were
using some dangerous pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, as a grower,
that is your responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're supposed to read every bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go to the grow store,
you should have already read about that
[SPEAKER_00]: product before you bought it today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read every bottle and then go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know what that one ingredient
is, if you don't know what spinosad is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you heard me recommend spinosad to get rid
of white flies on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know what spinosad is,
before you spray it, go read what that
[SPEAKER_00]: shit is and understand what you're
spraying on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your responsibility as a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have read every bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have researched everything so
that you know what you're putting into
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself and so that you know what you are
giving to sick people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this counts even if it's a commercial
or a recreational grow because you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know where that product is going to end
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have no idea who's going to be smoking
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to make more people more
sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's work on healing people, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be more responsible with your grows,
please.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Kristen Wyatt from the
Associated Press.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, much respect to The Cannabis for
always keeping the good news coming my
[SPEAKER_00]: direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, it is 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some killer thunder rolling
through my neighborhood right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has finally cooled off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been stupid hot here the past few
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm putting myself together a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys are getting a dab
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the count of five, let's do a dab here
together, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry about the silence while I'm dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys are dabbing with me so it
wasn't super silent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got an email recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, this was a Facebook message.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a message from somebody who follows
me on Facebook and also supports my
[SPEAKER_00]: Periscope because I saw you on Periscope
and you reminded me about this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you're not on the Periscope
app, if you're not checking out Periscope,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should definitely do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get it on Apple devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get it on Android devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Periscope app is fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You download it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go follow me.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I come on live, it'll whistle at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can open up the screen and you can
watch me rant or ramble or take dabs or
[SPEAKER_00]: walk through a grow room or whatever I
happen to be doing that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Periscope is a live broadcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the video stays up for 24 hours
unless I said something stupid and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: go delete the whole video.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the time I leave it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys check it out on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm coughing from that dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a drink and then I'm
going to get onto the point to this next
[SPEAKER_00]: topic here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Root Beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next topic is carbon filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was saying, my friend sent me an
email asking about carbon filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me start off by saying that the
information that you sent me, you had an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of which carbon filter you wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have chosen the right filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the info that you gave me,
you were talking about getting the 39 inch
[SPEAKER_00]: tall with either an eight or a six inch
duct on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would work perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thunder is so sexy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to turn off the compression so that
you guys can hear the thunder in the
[SPEAKER_00]: background, but I can't get it on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not loud enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about a little bit about
selecting a carbon filter, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I should explain to you what
a carbon filter is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're not familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: A carbon filter is what we use to take the
air, to take the smell out of the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the air is leaving your grow room,
it's going to stink like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have flowering plants and you have
a blower or an inline fan blowing air out
[SPEAKER_00]: of your grow room, because you have to get
that humidity out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get that old air out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get some fresh air in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're blowing that old air out,
it is going to smell like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to stink like a skunk or fruit
or berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to stink if you're doing it
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the carbon filter goes on your inline
fan and then it goes out of your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It blows the air out of the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the air that passes through the carbon
filter will be cleaned.
[SPEAKER_00]: The carbon filter is a cylinder with
activated charcoal in it and it connects
[SPEAKER_00]: to your inline fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it blows air through the carbon
filter first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can do inline fan or ducting,
however you choose, but then you go out of
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow area.
[SPEAKER_00]: The air that goes through the carbon
filter has all of the contaminants
[SPEAKER_00]: removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those contaminants include the odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's basically the stone version.
[SPEAKER_00]: of what a carbon filter is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cylinder with activated charcoal
that connects to your inline fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the air goes through it,
it removes the contaminated air and odors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we'll talk a little bit about how
to select your carbon filter, because this
[SPEAKER_00]: is the part that our friend needed help
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal of your carbon filter and your
blower in your room is to exchange the air
[SPEAKER_00]: in your grow room every one to three
minutes for best odor control.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, what that means is you want to
take all of the air out of your room and
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't want to empty it and then refill
it, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to be sucking air out of the
room and refilling every one to three
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to get the air completely
exchanged every two to three minutes or 20
[SPEAKER_00]: to 30 times an hour-ish for best odor
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to do that, you need to find the cubic
volume of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do that, you measure length times
width times height.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will equal the cubic volume of
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you know the cubic volume of your
room, then you need to get an inline fan
[SPEAKER_00]: that will pull that volume of air 20 to 30
times per hour through your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll find a carbon filter that
matches that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's easy because the, all right,
what you need to do, you'll find the cubic
[SPEAKER_00]: volume of the room, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make up a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: This room is 12 by 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's got a 12 by 12 footprint with an
eight foot ceiling, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, I did the math, that comes out to
1000.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1152 cubic feet, or that's the cubic
volume of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want a blower, ideally,
that would pull, that would have a CFM
[SPEAKER_00]: rating of 1152 or close to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go look at the Vortex fan,
they actually sell one that is an 1140
[SPEAKER_00]: CFM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would use that on either a six or an
eight inch duct is what I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you would want to find a carbon
filter that is rated for the same amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of CFMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come in ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to need a carbon filter
that is able to scrub about 1152 cubic
[SPEAKER_00]: feet of volume in your room would be
ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go half of that, which is about
576, but you don't want to go much lower
[SPEAKER_00]: than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you went to a third of that,
you're looking in the 380s and you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be pulling enough humidity out
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, you may get the smell out that
way, but you're not going to be cooling
[SPEAKER_00]: the room and you're definitely not going
to remove enough humidity and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would recommend going 575 to like
1152, maybe 1200 at the max, but that's
[SPEAKER_00]: how you need to select your blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: A blower that is going to pull the
appropriate amount of air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the carbon filter will follow the
blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you get the right size flange on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come in anywhere from a four all the
way up to I think a 16, is as big as I've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have seen an 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if I've ever seen that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen that big of one in use,
but so once you find your carbon filter
[SPEAKER_00]: that matches your blower, I would
recommend that you hang the carbon filter
[SPEAKER_00]: as high as you can in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang it up as high as you can because heat
rises.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to keep your air conditioner down
low and you want to keep your heat that's
[SPEAKER_00]: up top.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to suck that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you guys change out the carbon
filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember they don't last more than a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are rechargeable,
but from what I have found, it's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: much cheaper to just go buy a new one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hard part is finding an economical,
or not economical, an environmentally
[SPEAKER_00]: friendly way to get rid of your old carbon
filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys have any suggestions on that,
you can send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to share that information on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get somebody to dispose of their carbon
filter more properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple lined up in my garage
that I don't know what to do with.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I hope that made
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my very quick lesson on how to
select a carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang it high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you're going to hang a big
carbon filter from the roof, from the
[SPEAKER_00]: ceiling, I mean, make sure you do it
smartly, wisely.
[SPEAKER_00]: God, my grammar is terrible today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you use a stud and not like a
guy like myself or Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you find a beam in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just do everything smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't destroy the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't hurt yourself, especially hanging a
40 pound, 50 pound carbon filter above
[SPEAKER_00]: your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit could fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want it to break you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want it to break your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would miss you if you quit listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely hate it if you hurt yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Safety first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since I'm talking about that,
here's a piece of advice that I don't talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about often enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody was like, hey bro, if you could
put like one or two essential pieces of
[SPEAKER_00]: gear in a grow room that I may have
overlooked, what would they be?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I told him?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said a fire extinguisher on the outside
of the room, right outside the door and a
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke alarm inside of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't share that information enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I definitely recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a smoke alarm in there and then put
your fire extinguisher outside of the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room if it's a residential grow,
because you don't want to have to run in
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow room to find the fire
extinguisher in the worst case scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it right outside so you can kick
open the door and just start spraying if
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that never has to happen for you
guys, but I hope you do have a fire
[SPEAKER_00]: extinguisher in the case that you do need
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope you had a smoke alarm to give
you some heads up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be that guy that burned down your
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I feel like I've been
going for about 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go click over to the GarageBand and
see how long we've been going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just about, almost 27 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if I start doing the closing
now, we should wrap up right on time for a
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 minute episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been listening to these 30 minute
episodes a whole lot more than you did
[SPEAKER_00]: those 45 and hour long shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a lot of you pot smokers have
ADD, or maybe you just have a short lunch
[SPEAKER_00]: break or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I appreciate you guys listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see that you listened to the whole
episode and I can see who cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't see who, but I can see that a lot
of the listeners cut out at certain times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've learned that about 36 minutes is
your attention span.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to keep them about 36 minutes,
40 at the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I appreciate everybody for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm going to start closing up
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out our sponsors,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget about Hygro Indoor Growing

[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're at the Pueblo shop,
if they don't have what you want,
[SPEAKER_00]: they could possibly get it from Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, they'll get it from the vendor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get it from the distributor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be fresh.
