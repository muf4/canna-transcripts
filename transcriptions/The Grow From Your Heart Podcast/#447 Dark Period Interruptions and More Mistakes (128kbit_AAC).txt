[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 447 of the Grow
From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by my friends at Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds in your garden,
I highly recommend Seeds Here Now,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can find them at www.seedsherenow
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start this podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Lemon G
Batter from our friends at Apothecary
[SPEAKER_00]: Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency label says this product
contains 68.5% THC and 79.1% total
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love the Lemon G.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm cracking it open to get a nice smell
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very lemon dominant, but it is a
disgusting lemon flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is an armpit and a garlicky sort of
a thing going on with this Lemon G.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy the flavor and the aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: The texture and consistency of this batter
were beautiful, but my favorite part is
[SPEAKER_00]: the high from the Lemon G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something about the Lemon G puts me in a
really good mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes my brain go really fast,
kind of makes me feel like I time travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a really great concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my friends at
Apothecary Farms for the delicious and
[SPEAKER_00]: tremendous Lemon G Batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to read a
couple of emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to follow up on some grow
room mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let's do some shout
outs to a couple of our friends from

[SPEAKER_00]: And now I think it is time to start
reading some emails from our listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have been following the show,
you know, I've done a couple of episodes
[SPEAKER_00]: about mistakes that people make in the
grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I admitted a bunch of mistakes I have
made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I talked about common mistakes that
I've seen in commercial environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since that episode, I've received several
emails from listeners who wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: confess to some of their grow room sins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a few emails in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into the first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Ross to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it has been.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you been?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to hear from you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message says, I started listening to
the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four years ago for knowledge and stayed
because I enjoy your enthusiasm towards
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do try to be enthusiastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to have a good vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to stay positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad that you're learning
something while you're listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says this mistake happened recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work in a commercial grow facility where
we started seeing some information that
[SPEAKER_00]: was not adding up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were seeing things like foxtailing on
our buds, but we assumed that our
[SPEAKER_00]: environment was fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problems continued and closer to
harvest, the plants just seemed to burn
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought we had inspected everything
until we realized that we had a light
[SPEAKER_00]: timer that was failing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for two weeks, our grow room was on a
24 hour on schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: In hindsight, that really explains most of
the issues in our garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest thing that I learned was
thinking that this problem was something
[SPEAKER_00]: severe and that I needed an expert to be
called in and help me solve the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we should have done is start in
the beginning and check the very basics
[SPEAKER_00]: first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that was an expensive lesson,
but that is a lesson that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure that nobody in that facility
will ever make this mistake ever again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may have been costly, but you have
learned from it and you won't do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're able to share it with me
and I'm sharing it with a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're seeing weird things in your
flower room, if the plants are not acting
[SPEAKER_00]: the way you think they should,
if they're not flowering properly,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're getting weird foxtailing,
you may have a light issue, your timer may
[SPEAKER_00]: be failing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite often, those timers with the tabs,
which you push up or pull down to select
[SPEAKER_00]: the on and off times, they get stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: They quit spinning either humidity or
whatever in the air or something sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you touch nutrients and touch those,
or maybe you splash on the timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get stuck and they don't spin
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're supposed to turn with the hour,
but then they stop turning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your timer doesn't click on and click
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will result in your lights being off
or on for way too long probably,
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe even a cloner being off or on way
too long, or any sort of equipment not
[SPEAKER_00]: cycling properly, which can lead to major
issues depending on how long this problem
[SPEAKER_00]: goes unnoticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the first things I would suggest
is quality timers in all parts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't buy those cheap little peg timers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a quality grow room timer,
something industrial if you can afford it,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on your setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a good timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing is to remember the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like this listener said, he thought
he needed an expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: He thought he was going to call in
consultants and spend a bunch of money
[SPEAKER_00]: when really all he needed to do was get a
monitor or go in the room and see what's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually happening in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's nothing more reliable than
walking in there yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You open the door and you say,
oh, there's no lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really easy to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not always at our grow facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of things going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's life keeps every person extremely
busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're living enough life for three
people in most one person lives,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what would help you out is something
like a grow room monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many different monitors
available, something like a pulse monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like a PL grow monitor,
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a smart B unit, anything like that
would help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you can pay attention to the
lights, the temperature, the humidity and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything happening in that grow when
you're not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start to see problems,
you can say, when did we see this problem
[SPEAKER_00]: develop?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pull up your charts and you can
look and you can say, oh, look,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really hot at night right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can start realizing maybe the
lights are on, maybe it's too warm because
[SPEAKER_00]: something's not cycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you can use those notes to math up
with the notes you're taking on your
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: By using deductive reasoning and logic,
you'll be able to tell what's causing the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good monitor would help you out in this
situation, but go back to the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that all of the basic shit is
working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the lights cycling off and on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the air conditioner cycling?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you overwatering?
[SPEAKER_00]: How's the humidity?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is the VPD?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we just need to go back to the
basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to be the biggest lesson in
this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep going because there is
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I think for grow resumes,
we should include our mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a great idea for a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are not humbled and are not
skilled enough, so they still need to play
[SPEAKER_00]: the Wizard of Oz, so they are not going to
tell us any mistakes they have made.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on to say, experience is the name
we give for our mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how I have become a really
experienced and fairly good grower is I
[SPEAKER_00]: have made a lot of mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was new, I would make it a mission
or a goal to take one plant out of every
[SPEAKER_00]: grow and try to destroy it and learn
something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody would say, hey, have you ever
done this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd say, nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of my friends would go and do that
to their entire crop and they may kill it
[SPEAKER_00]: with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may literally kill it with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do it to one plant and compare
that to the plant next to it and see if it
[SPEAKER_00]: worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I've got some sort of comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I have some sort of control,
something to compare my new technique to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I know if it's usable,
if it's worthwhile, or if it's just a
[SPEAKER_00]: habit or a trick that I picked up along
the way that I need to eliminate.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wraps up the message by saying,
I just wanted to share my story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for all you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep doing what you are doing and maybe I
will see you at a fish show at Dick's this
[SPEAKER_00]: summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I look forward to seeing you at
Dick's.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really easy to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 6'5".
[SPEAKER_00]: I got dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's a lot of dreadlocked white
guys at a fish show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of stand out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't go down in the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be closer to the back of the venue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got some dancing space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to spread my arms and spin around
like a hippie.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will be me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wraps it up with, you are a good
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you and cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they sign their name, which I am not
sure if they want set on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to withhold that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a big thank you and a big shout out to
them for the great email and also a big
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out for being humble enough to admit
that you have made a mistake in your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another email in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says name can be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my buddy, Big John.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the excitement of growing for the first
time, I chose my seeds without thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: how tall they will grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I vegged the shit out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I monster cropped them and I bent them for
too full months.
[SPEAKER_00]: My girls were huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I flipped to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I bet you had a jungle in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, wow, what a jungle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you had a jungle in there literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, wow, what a jungle and quite
overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you vegged for two months and you do a
lot of popping and twisting and super
[SPEAKER_00]: cropping, you are going to get quite a
dense canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have a nice lush area filled with
plants, but it will be quite overwhelming
[SPEAKER_00]: and that can become quite a pain in the
ass to work with if you were a new grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So choosing seeds, I've talked about that
in a previous episode, choosing your seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: can be a very important process.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't realize that you've just
purchased a haze that is going to grow 12
[SPEAKER_00]: feet tall and take 16 weeks, that can
really mess up your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So choose wisely when it comes to
selecting your genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here is a shameless plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite often people ask me what strain I
would recommend for a new grower if they
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to grow iry genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to grow regular iry genetic
seeds, I would recommend sun kiss and
[SPEAKER_00]: prana for new growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are very easy plants to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't get too tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't take really long to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're easy to maintain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you'll have great success with
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sun kiss and prana are what I would
start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were into feminized seeds,
I would suggest orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orangegasm will work wonderfully for
growers of all experience levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is simple to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It finishes fairly early and it makes
amazing flowers and concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got sun kiss, you've got prana
and you've got orangegasm are the things I
[SPEAKER_00]: would recommend for new growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now our friend Big John wraps up this
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, also I grow in deep water
culture, which means that these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: were growing even more quickly than I had
assumed they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants were taking off.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy had a jungle in this grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only visualize how crowded that
place was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you didn't get powdery mildew
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that was a successful crop,
but I am glad that you learned from your
[SPEAKER_00]: lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wraps up the message by saying,
yours truly, Big John.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hey, Big John, thank you for the great
email and thank you for admitting that you
[SPEAKER_00]: made a mistake while when choosing your
seeds for your first grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I've got another email in my
hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from a friend who calls
themselves Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the message, Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up Rasta Jeff, just giving you a
little insight on mistakes I have made in
[SPEAKER_00]: my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these were compounded by other
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel a lot of these problems could have
been avoided with the proper equipment,
[SPEAKER_00]: but sometimes you don't have a choice and
you just run what you brung.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a separate AC unit for the
grow and I had to open and close the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower room door every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I left the damn door open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he says more than once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, luckily I think I learned after the
first time, but it sounds like our buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt here is a little stubborn.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had to learn a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, I didn't have a dehumidifier
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to make a homemade light blocking
vent at the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before this, my nighttime humidity was
higher than the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: During this cycle, I had one Afghani
dominant girl and she did not like much
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I overwatered her while some of my others
got the right amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on to say, not having a monocrop
in the first set of grows for a beginner
[SPEAKER_00]: can be a major mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that can be a huge mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got multiple different strains
or different phenotypes in one room,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to learn all of those phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got different girlfriends to learn
how to take care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: One wants more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: One wants less water.
[SPEAKER_00]: One plant may want higher temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: One wants lower humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those plants want different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are running, one strain,
one cultivar in your room, it is much
[SPEAKER_00]: easier to learn that plant and dial in the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make that one plant happier much
more easily than you can multiple plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on to say, not
monocropping with absolutely no idea how
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants are going to behave led to
light burn on some and not enough light on
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So exactly what I'm talking about,
some of his plants grew really tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got really close and hit the lights,
which actually caused shade on some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he would have been better off running a
bunch of the same strain instead of a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, once I started to get
everything dialed in a little bit better,
[SPEAKER_00]: it seemed that my genetics may have not
been up to the task of providing the dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've concluded this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sprouted a bag seed and even though the
yield was low, it was incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If everything is running at 50%,
the absolute best you can do is 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you have the best seeds ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your grow space, your grow room,
your grow setup is only as strong as its
[SPEAKER_00]: weakest link.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got the best lights on the
planet, you've got the best airflow,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you've got shitty seeds or shitty
soil, you're going to come out with a
[SPEAKER_00]: shitty product in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need everything to be 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this guy said, if you're running
something at 50%, the best we can do is
[SPEAKER_00]: 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need quality equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need the proper equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course you need quality genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message goes on to say, but probably
the most boneheaded mistake I've ever seen
[SPEAKER_00]: was from another person.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were drinking a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I don't want to know how this ends up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not encourage any drinking or alcohol
consumption in the grow environment in any
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, if you show up drunk to the
commercial grow, I send you home.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a little talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cause a lot of mistakes being a
little bit drunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can fuck up when you're stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to be judgmental,
but some terrible ideas, some terrible
[SPEAKER_00]: things come up when you're drinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear about what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were drinking a little and I messed
with him and said to take the blowtorch to
[SPEAKER_00]: the spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's highly effective, but I'm sure that
that went fucking wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said their hatred for spider mites plus
the alcohol and my comment led to a very
[SPEAKER_00]: bad idea on IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say that the plants defoliated
themselves within the next few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, you went in there with fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were lucky that those, well,
they defoliated themselves and they
[SPEAKER_00]: probably died.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't say you're lucky about
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants had problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants defoliated themselves and
there were still spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you basically killed the wrong part and
kept the bad part.
[SPEAKER_00]: He keeps saying I actually tried to stop
him, but hey, alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was cringing the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you've got me cringing now,
just reading about it, just hearing about
[SPEAKER_00]: it, and it had nothing to do with my
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can only imagine what that smelled
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only imagine what those plants felt
like getting fire put to them way too
[SPEAKER_00]: early.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're supposed to finish flowering those
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're supposed to dry and cure them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're supposed to put fire to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys did that all backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you for the great message,
Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, quit drinking in the grow room and
behave yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the dab torch down and let's get a
proper integrated pest management program
[SPEAKER_00]: in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is all of the emails I have got for
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody for sending in
their grow room mistake emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for admitting your grow room
sins.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody out there would like to send me
an email, if you would like to tell me
[SPEAKER_00]: about more of your grow room mistakes,
if you've got a grow question,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you've just got something you'd like to
say, you can send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is growfromyourheart at
hotmail.com, and I would love to hear from
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been thinking about this for the past
few days, and I was sure there were more
[SPEAKER_00]: mistakes that I have made that I forgot to
mention on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I thought of was I killed a
bunch of seedlings one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I germinated a few packs of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I labeled them all carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I went to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came home from work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was exhausted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ate dinner, took a shower, went to bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: About four in the morning, I woke up and
went, aw, you killed all those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were dry by the time I went to go
look at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was over.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another classic, expensive example
of ways that I have fucked up in the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room, another major mistake that I have
made.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to shift gears, and I'm going
to talk about another message I received
[SPEAKER_00]: from a listener.
[SPEAKER_00]: I received a message from a listener
asking about interrupting dark cycles in a
[SPEAKER_00]: photoperiod plant which is in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They asked if one interruption would cause
possible problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were asking if just a couple of brief
interruptions would cause problems and how
[SPEAKER_00]: critical it is to have that plant in total
darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk briefly about how important
it is to have our flowering plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: complete uninterrupted darkness during
their night cycle in the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we are working with photoperiod
cannabis plants, what triggers those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to start making their flowering
process is an uninterrupted 12-hour dark
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some plants may need a little shorter
dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants may even need a little longer
dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of what we have bred has been
bred to want a 12-hour dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to be different outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about that in a very
future, a very near upcoming episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: But indoors, we try to focus on a 12-hour
dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens in that dark period is the
plant realizes, hey, there is no sun
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So different hormones start moving around
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant goes to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different things happen while that plant
is sleeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that plant realizes we only get 12
hours of light, we get 12 hours of full
[SPEAKER_00]: darkness, it is time for us to flower
because winter is coming and it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be too cold for me to continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need to create flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant's main goal is to create flowers
that receive pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main goal for this plant is to receive
pollen and create seeds so that it can
[SPEAKER_00]: live next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try our best to prevent that by not
allowing any males into the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't get seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get big seedless, delicious buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that the plants know to do that
process is that 12-12 cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we do interrupt that cycle,
we do run the risk of causing problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel when you've been asleep
for half of your night cycle and somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: wakes you up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody is ever in a good mood if you get
woken up halfway through your sleep cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are used to getting 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're sleeping for 12 hours,
you need to go to the doctor, but you're
[SPEAKER_00]: probably getting somewhere between six and
eight hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody interrupts that, you're a
cranky bitch all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your cannabis plants feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the cannabis plants can't throw a fit
all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis plants can't have an attitude
with you all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those cannabis plants can't go to
Starbucks and get a fucking triple shot of
[SPEAKER_00]: something that will try to fix their
morning and get their day back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your cannabis plants have very few
different ways to express their
[SPEAKER_00]: frustration with you for interrupting
their dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number one thing you're going to see
from interrupted dark cycles is
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphroditic plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't see herm flowers pop up,
you still may see seeds in your finished
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds are because you interrupted
that light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will cause hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will cause stress in your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the main part of the question was how
many of those light interruptions will it
[SPEAKER_00]: take to cause a problem with the garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is that that is very strain
specific, probably very cultivar specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the rest of the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the genetics and the
breeding of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a hermaphroditic trait in that
plant or is that plant a solid female?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of what we are sharing as clones are
solid females.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of the clones that we are used to
running do have the potential to express
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphroditic traits if given the right
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the perfect environment to express
hermaphroditism is an interrupted light
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is very plant specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very phenotype specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very cultivar specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a professional grower who runs large
scale commercial environments,
[SPEAKER_00]: I follow the rule that any light
interruption is too much interruption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of your garden as a no parking zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you drive downtown, you see a sign
that says no parking.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put your car there, a cop will give
you a ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you come back to your car and you
say, I was only there a second,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cop is going to say, does that say one
second parking zone or does that say a no
[SPEAKER_00]: parking zone?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is no fucking parking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't park there just to run in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't park there just because.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is no parking.
[SPEAKER_00]: None.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't park here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Move your fucking car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think that the grow room is the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a no parking zone when it comes to
light interruptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: None.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no excuse for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no need for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't allow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I do understand that things happen and
you may need to run in there one night.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may hear something fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may hear the air conditioner start
whistling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something may go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you insist on going in your grow room
during the dark cycle, I suggest entering
[SPEAKER_00]: that room with a green LED headlamp as
your light source.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can function with that green light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see what is going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can identify a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can move around the room without
tripping and bumping into shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that green light will not affect the
photo period of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants will not know that there is
even a light happening in that grow room
[SPEAKER_00]: if you use a green LED light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are a couple of things to think
about while you're entering the room
[SPEAKER_00]: during the dark period and you are using
your green LED light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number one mistake I have seen people
make in a commercial environment once they
[SPEAKER_00]: have entered a grow room in the dark
period, they've got their LED headlamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is going fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then some asshole wants to know what time
it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they pull out their phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That phone is a light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That phone, that light is light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That counts as a light interruption.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be very minimal, but it counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are now interrupting the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're in that grow room,
you've got your LED headlamp on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't pull out your phone to see what time
it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't pull out your phone to check a text
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can wait until you get out of the
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now another thing to think about when you
are entering that dark room, make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that when you open the door, you don't get
light from another room shining right into
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to make the outer room dark if
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I do understand that we don't live in
a perfect world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not be able to make the outside
environment perfectly dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to pull that door open,
run in there as quickly as possible and
[SPEAKER_00]: pull that door shut.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are running stable genetics,
this should not cause a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are many words in that sentence
that are very critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first word was stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your genetics must be stable or this will
cause a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also said if and should.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are running stable genetics,
it should not cause a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how stable your genetics are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who bred them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how close to a hermaphrodite
those plants are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what other stressors they may
be receiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could contribute.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may just be the final straw.
[SPEAKER_00]: That simple light leak may just be the
weight that broke that camel's back and it
[SPEAKER_00]: decided, fuck it, I'm a herm now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would recommend zero light
interruptions unless it is an absolute
[SPEAKER_00]: emergency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat it like a no parking zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a parking here for a couple of
minutes zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a, I just parked here to run
inside zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a zero parking zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wraps up my rant on not interrupting
the dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done a full episode called Total
Darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to listen to an entire
episode based on total darkness in your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room, I encourage you to check out
that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: That episode is number 291 and it is
titled Total Darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the future, I do have an episode
planned talking about flowering our plants
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors that will come out very soon
because it is just about time for the
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor flowering season.
