[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up, Podcast World?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 427 of the Grow
From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: No long fancy intro, no ads.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to talk about what I'm
smoking, no Patreon shout outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get right down to business
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am frequently a guest on a show called
Embracing Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Embracing Organics is, of course,
an organic-based cannabis growing podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: that is found on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: We record the show on Thursdays at 7 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain Time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to join us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am on the show quite frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to talk about growing and I like to
talk about breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even when I'm not there, it is still a
great podcast and the boys have a great
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the most recent episode, I brought up a
great topic that I wanted to cut from
[SPEAKER_00]: their show with their permission and
replay here on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel like it requires a lot of
setup because I do a pretty good
[SPEAKER_00]: explanation in the rant that I was
delivering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will also be back at the end of that
recording to deliver some fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: information that I've discovered since
that original recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, ladies and gentlemen, with no further
ado, let's time travel back to last
[SPEAKER_00]: Thursday and revisit my rant about Philos
Bioscience on the Embracing Organics
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody got anything cool they want to
talk about this week?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any cool topics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I didn't want to jump right in,
but since there's dead air silence,
[SPEAKER_00]: the thing that has been popular in the
cannabis community that I haven't touched
[SPEAKER_00]: on yet seems to be the Philos Galaxy news
that has come to light lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I sound distracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting a dab together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need this dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get your dab together.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to play a little devil's
advocate here, but personally,
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't looked into anything about this
Philo stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as I know from what I've seen on
Instagram and blah, blah, blah,
[SPEAKER_03]: blah, blah, people are claiming that
they're stealing genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're claiming that they're taking their
stuff and heading for the high hills with
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm seeing a lot of like, oh, Philos is
doing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Philos is doing that, but I haven't really
dug anything up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't gotten any of my own research.
[SPEAKER_03]: You seem to know a little bit about what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead and inform me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a lot to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the reaction is misinformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis industry loves a nice witch
hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love to hang someone out to dry as soon
as we hear somebody say something that
[SPEAKER_00]: ruffles our feathers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried not to get involved in that
feather ruffling and tried to wait and see
[SPEAKER_00]: how it unfolded.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big misconception that I see,
people seem to think that Philos has our
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think that we sent them clones or
small babies or something that they have
[SPEAKER_00]: made a tissue culture or a clone of.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not have our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have got our genetic data is
basically what they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you send material to Philos,
you don't send them a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take a small card that unfolds,
you rub part of the plant material in
[SPEAKER_00]: there to get the juices out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You fold it back up and you send it to
them just the same way that you spit into
[SPEAKER_00]: a little package for 23andMe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the same process.
[SPEAKER_00]: 23andMe maybe they could, but 23andMe
doesn't have my arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have to send them part of my arm
for them to get my DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't send them a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You send them just juices basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't regenerate our plants from the
small amount of data we gave them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they do have is the genetic marker of
all of our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they know what makes up each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they do have is an advantage now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have already seen basically what
happens if you breed almost all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: popular cultivars that are out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've seen it bred to all of the other
cultivars and they've got a really good
[SPEAKER_00]: predictive chart and a map and a kind of a
cheat code in breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically to my understanding what
they have done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their intention to my understanding is not
to take our plants and reproduce them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to use the info that we have
provided to breed better plants for the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: In their opinion, better plants for the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how that is going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't speak for their intention there,
but from what they have released,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't have our stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't steal our stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to use our data because we
all sent them our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sign an agreement saying that they can
use your data.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can use it for science.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can reproduce it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a long list of things you allow
them to do when you send them your
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: We gave them permission to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when you send a scientist or a
laboratory any sort of material,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not storing it and doing you a
favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is part of their job.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what science is for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get into a science industry to
just collect data.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to do something with that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, they're looking to breed with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to use our research.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what is kind of frustrating the
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've spent years doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody in the chat earlier said that
they have done what a small family of
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders would have done in several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got all of that data to
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the entire cannabis community has
done over years, they've got all of that
[SPEAKER_00]: data to themselves and they charged us to
get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They charge you $250 to $300 per
submission to enter a strain into their
[SPEAKER_00]: galaxy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They charged us money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put our strains into their galaxy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, they're using that data to their
advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what is kind of pissing off a lot
of growers and breeders and the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a breeder, I'm not worried.
[SPEAKER_00]: If and when they do get to breeding and
creating their own strains, they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to hire breeders who are people just like
us who have experience with plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to pay those people to do
projects that are charted out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have instructions to
follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how breeding happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are going to be Budweiser or Walmart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know the smaller one to
compare it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always going to be mom and pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people go to Walmart.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people buy Budweiser,
but so many people want that mom and pop
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not worried about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's integrity in good
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what they're doing in a way,
it helps the movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are going to develop plants that will
be, they say, more resistant to bugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: more resistant to pathogens, more
resistant to mildew and molds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They claim that they'll be able to dial in
specific strains to have very specific
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene profiles to where if you want
cheesecake, you can breed a strain that
[SPEAKER_00]: tastes like cheesecake or you can breed
one that tastes like... How much of their
[SPEAKER_04]: database is a public knowledge that
another breeder could use their data and
[SPEAKER_04]: do the same thing and choose the parents
that they want?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because isn't it kind of like a public
thing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do they have their own?
[SPEAKER_04]: They recommend that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you explore their galaxy, there are
spaces where they recommend breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: specific strains together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, nobody has done this yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since these strains are so far apart
in our galaxy, we recommend breeding them
[SPEAKER_00]: because it would make unique phenotypes is
something that they actually send that to
[SPEAKER_00]: you when you file strains with their
galaxy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll make those recommendations for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they actually suggested something that
I had already done.
[SPEAKER_00]: They recommended, I crossed, first they
said Girl Scout cookies to Grateful Dog
[SPEAKER_00]: and I had already done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also suggested I crossed the Space
Queen to my Grateful Dog and I had already
[SPEAKER_00]: done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were, they were predicting things
that I was going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were predicting my moves that I had
been planning through science.
[SPEAKER_00]: They saw it before I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's almost scary in a way,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: As a breeder, you know, a lot of the
information they have is lineage breed or
[SPEAKER_01]: lineage information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Besides a lot of unknown cultivars,
you know, where you don't know the
[SPEAKER_01]: lineage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the data was out there,
you know, before you as a breeder,
[SPEAKER_01]: before you take on any project,
you do your research and do what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: crossing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't just go, Oh, this looks pretty
and this looks pretty and slap them
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, hopefully there's a long process
behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the information was out there and is
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you find your lineages,
you see how those have been grown out and
[SPEAKER_01]: what the results are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you make your best educated decision
based off of the data that you draw.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've just drawn a ton of data and
brought it into one spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: A ton of data.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's the thing, like everybody
forgets how many active compounds a
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis plant itself has.
[SPEAKER_05]: And every seed is a little different than
the other seed that you germinate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they may be similar, but they're still
different compounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're a little bit higher in each one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for them to really take that and say,
Hey, this is what we're going to create.
[SPEAKER_05]: They still don't know exactly what all
compounds they're going to find.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have an idea, but they don't know for
sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the fact that Jeff compared them to
like Budweiser or like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like a Miller or something, you know,
I mean, like a really big, just broad
[SPEAKER_03]: industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, me personally, I'm not a
drinker, but I would much rather go to a
[SPEAKER_03]: small brewery.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would much rather support a small home
brewer versus like a big corporation like
[SPEAKER_03]: Miller.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, dude, there's tons of people out
there that want that stuff that are
[SPEAKER_03]: perfectly happy and fine with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what's going on Fumidor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, the Embracing Organics podcast
is recorded live on Google Hangouts,
[SPEAKER_00]: which gives the opportunity for guests to
come and go at different points of the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I have to leave the show early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I show up for the show late.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point in the show, we were joined
by another friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: We politely greeted him.
[SPEAKER_00]: We said hello to him for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We let him talk about where he was.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was at a new cannabis club.
[SPEAKER_00]: We let him hype that up for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He politely said goodbye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we continued on with our talk about
Philos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dirtman Dan seemed to remember exactly
where he was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just let him pick up right where
he left off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, here is Dirtman Dan.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, like I was saying earlier,
I like the fact that like Jeff was
[SPEAKER_03]: comparing these guys to like a big
corporation like a Walmart or a Miller or
[SPEAKER_03]: something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yes, there there is their place for
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But me being the person I am, I like
supporting the small mama pop shops,
[SPEAKER_03]: even though there is that giant
corporation right down the street.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to wind up spending more at
the mama pop shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know at the end of the day,
I'm probably getting a better quality
[SPEAKER_03]: product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that makes me happier.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think some some of the issues,
too, is people weren't getting credit for
[SPEAKER_05]: some of these genetics that people sold
over the years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people wanted to know what really was
going on and who really had what to begin
[SPEAKER_05]: with.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this kind of helps sort through some
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can see we can trace it back
through DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can say, well, that came from this,
came from this, came from this or nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have more opportunity to find out what
OG really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to find out what OG Kush
really is, where it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll find out if all these different
different named OGs, the SFV, the original
[SPEAKER_00]: OG, all the different ones, we'll find out
if they're the same cut or if they came
[SPEAKER_00]: from the same seed stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be able to narrow that down and end
that rumor, which will be really cool for
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because everybody swears they have a
cut of the OG or, you know, I got OG this,
[SPEAKER_03]: I got OG that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, it don't matter where you're at.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody's got the OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is it that original OG?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there are so many OGs back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the SFV and then there's the Tahoe
and they're probably very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so many different ones from
supposedly the one group, like so many
[SPEAKER_05]: different variances and pheno expressions
that came out of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'd be really interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plants being handed down and down from
generation to generation just also gets
[SPEAKER_04]: lost too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody will, somebody will, you know,
forget what it is and then make up a name
[SPEAKER_03]: and, oh, we've been growing that for
forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter what the name is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even the mislabeling.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, people fucking mislabeled some
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think people forgot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that in your neighborhood,
there's a guy over there selling OG Kush
[SPEAKER_00]: and everyone's buying OG Kush,
but I need mine to be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to call it Jeff's OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now mine's a little bit more expensive
and you want to buy Jeff's OG because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: that new hot shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just got to rename it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how a lot of that happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I know many times I was handed
cuts and I was told that these are kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: exclusive and don't really say what they
are.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're going to show them on your
channel, change the name of them,
[SPEAKER_05]: something like, we don't want people to
know what this is and where it came from.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was saying before the show,
I see a lot of this stuff as the
[SPEAKER_02]: inevitable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I am hoping for federal
legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I want to be able to grow these
plants like they're tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I want everyone to be able to
have access to it that needs or wants
[SPEAKER_02]: access to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as they're, you know, an adult.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, responsible with their lives,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but, um, my whole point is like,
this is only the inevitable of,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, when legalization comes in,
because you're going to have companies
[SPEAKER_02]: like Bayer, you know, big, like Phylos is
tiny.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have big fucking boys
coming in and throwing down, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: intellectual property rights, all over
shit, trying to, you know, patent these,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, strains and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're going to have some real.
[SPEAKER_02]: Real money to throw at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then people are really going to be
shitting their pants like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are freaking out over nothing right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, over some, some data because that's
all Phylos has data.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it's going to be too hard to
patent this plant itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's too many variables to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, besides hurt, maybe you're trying to
be illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to put some sort of tracer
in there and they're going to let their
[SPEAKER_02]: shit grow and their pollen is going to
fucking fly or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're going to come in your
field, find, you know, seed and your
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking crop from what their genetic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, you know, that's what Monsanto
already does.
[SPEAKER_05]: Farmers lost their farms because of all
this shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's some horrible shit that happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point in the show, we kind of
drifted off into a different conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are about six people in the live
feed at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does get a little bit hectic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I chose to cut out at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hear the full unedited version of
that podcast on the embracing organics
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That original episode aired on May the
second, which was a Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that should be really easy to find on
the YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do encourage you to go listen to that
full episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also encourage you to subscribe to the
embracing organics podcast, YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then next week, you can join us for the
next live Thursday podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to talk about here with the
Phylos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Galaxy controversy as stabby and MedFit
touched on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are things to think about like
intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of breeders, a lot of creators of
very popular strains sent their
[SPEAKER_00]: information to Phylos.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have now got our data.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have got our intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are going to use our intellectual
property to further their breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of different ways to think
about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can think about this as your art being
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can think about it as your business
being used.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of different ways to think
about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of different approaches to
come at this subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to come at it from all angles
and keep a clear head and an open mind so
[SPEAKER_00]: that I can relay the information properly
without being biased.
[SPEAKER_00]: A recent rumor or allegation that has been
flying through the cannabis community and
[SPEAKER_00]: social media is that Phylos Bioscience may
possibly be linked up with a company in
[SPEAKER_00]: Israel who is actively working to patent
specific cannabis strains or variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is something that would be really
shitty and shady of them to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We gave them our plant data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they are using that data to create
their own patents.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is again an allegation and a rumor
that I will look more into and I will
[SPEAKER_00]: report more information to you as it does
come to light.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of information coming out
very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The owner and spokesperson of Phylos
Bioscience has been scheduled to appear
[SPEAKER_00]: and speak on numerous podcasts this past
week, but as expected, he has backed out
[SPEAKER_00]: at the last moment for every interview he
has scheduled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I do find more information,
I will update you with that information
[SPEAKER_00]: and I will keep you guys in the loop as to
what is happening with Phylos Bioscience.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I'm wrapping up this recording,
I just received a message from our friend
[SPEAKER_00]: Medically Fit who is joining us on the
Embracing Organics podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has sent me a video that has a lot of
detailed information from the spokesperson
[SPEAKER_00]: and owner of Phylos Bioscience.
[SPEAKER_00]: This video can be found on the Soil King's
YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go to YouTube, search for The Soil
King.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got 18,000 subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give him a subscribe and the video you are
looking for is Phylos Bioscience Industry
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaders with Mowgli.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the video you want to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mowgli speaks for almost an hour about the
things he said in that controversial
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube video, that controversial
Instagram clip that everybody saw that
[SPEAKER_00]: sparked all of this controversy for his
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend you check out Phylos
Bioscience Industry Leaders with Mowgli on
[SPEAKER_00]: The Soil King's YouTube channel and,
of course, give him a subscribe since he's
[SPEAKER_00]: got such a great video up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I think that is all
I have got to cover for the Phylos
[SPEAKER_00]: Bioscience controversy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do learn more, I will do my best to
present that to you on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the conversation between Mowgli
and our friend Soil King will answer most
[SPEAKER_00]: of the remaining questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I want to give a huge shout
out to all of my friends over there at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Embracing Organics podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Dirtman Dan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Tanasi Gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to MedFit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Bear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, of course, as always, a big old shout
out to my buddy Stabby McStaberson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's somebody I missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people cycle in and out of that
chat room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, a big shout out to Pedro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, of course, a big shout out to Dizzy.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, if I keep going, I'm just going to
