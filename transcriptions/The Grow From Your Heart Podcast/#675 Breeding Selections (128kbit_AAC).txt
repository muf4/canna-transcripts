[SPEAKER_00]: This is of course the part of the show
where I do invite you to join us on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Discord server is approaching 1,500
members by the time this podcast episode
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might have 1,500 members on the Discord
server.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big salute, shout out, thank you for all
of the support on Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good time over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm having a great time hanging out with
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to jump in the chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just posted some questions and actually
a secret strain release idea asking for
[SPEAKER_00]: strain names.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of stuff happens over there on the
Discord so please do join us on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a link of course in the show
notes and in the video description.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been a long time since I've talked
about what strain I'm smoking on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to mention what strain I'm smoking
because it feels like I've got bricks on
[SPEAKER_00]: my head or excuse me maybe like I've got
some kind of belt around my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel slow motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a big fat dab of some blue fruit
live rosin from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody pays me to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody gives me the concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to the local dispensary and I
bought it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought it home, set up the equipment,
thought I should take a dab before I
[SPEAKER_00]: record and that stuff put me in slow
motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you catch me going a little bit slow
looking, feeling a little bit confused,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from the blue fruit and I am enjoying
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at Green
Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, they do not pay me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't sponsor the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just enjoyed the dab that I just took so
much that I thought you might notice and I
[SPEAKER_00]: should mention how good it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's keep things moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next order of business I want to talk
about is I want to send a big thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to all of the people that I ran
into at the Colorado Cool Vibes Reggae
[SPEAKER_00]: Festival at the Levitt Pavilion in Denver,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a reggae festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the first year of the reggae
festival and with the outcome that I saw,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guarantee we will have that festival
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope a lot of the same bands return.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me talk about some of the bands that
we got to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to see, when I showed up,
Mighty Mystic was playing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a reggae fan, you probably know
Mighty Mystic.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the Mighty Mystic, I think we got to
see Jamiri Morgan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to my buddy Jamiri Morgan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamiri is the son of Gramps Morgan,
who of course is a member of Morgan
[SPEAKER_00]: Heritage, who is one of probably my top
three, top five reggae bands of all time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might maybe have gotten to hang out with
Jamiri Morgan and Morgan Heritage a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not going to talk too much about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could tell by the smile on my face how
much fun I had there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to see Mighty Mystic, Jamiri
Morgan.
[SPEAKER_00]: After Jamiri Morgan, a band called Through
the Roots came on stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the band that sings Sorry for My
Bloodshot Eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen to reggae, if you listen to
reggae radio, any reggae channel,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've heard that song.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to see those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we got to see the beautiful,
lovely, and amazing Natalie Rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about going to a reggae show a
few nights ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to a another reggae show since
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't missed a show on the tour yet,
and it's just kind of a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only been two shows on the tour so
far, you guys, but I haven't missed a show
[SPEAKER_00]: on the tour, but it's been a good time
hanging out with all the reggae artists on
[SPEAKER_00]: Saturday at the reggae festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of got to hang out with everybody
and got spoiled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a lot of the cannabis community was
present at that festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the reggae community was present
at that festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people came and gave me hugs,
high fives, fist bumps, love and respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to everybody who gave me any
sort of love, respect, high five,
[SPEAKER_00]: fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you took a minute to compliment my
dreadlocks or my shoes, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just beaming with good vibes and big
energy because a reggae show is like my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite place to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was specially invited by one of my
favorite performers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to hang out with some of my favorite
reggae artists and see some of my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the older Rastas that I look up to
were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Colorado locals that have been putting
on reggae shows for years and have been in
[SPEAKER_00]: reggae bands here for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to hang out with them, hang out with
some popular reggae bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could tell, still vibing from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big up to everybody who showed me some
love at the reggae festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are not here to talk about a
reggae fest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are here to talk about growing
ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's focus a little bit on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for letting me rant about reggae
music for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I caught myself chattering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm high.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get back on track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have some great Patreon questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're going to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we are going to talk about and
I'm going to edit that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to talk about some patriots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, patreon.com forward slash grow
from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go with this one first.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like what name do they want me to
use?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to say this came from our
friend Warwick and it goes a lot like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, what's up Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some seeds from a source who has
some sort of wizard of Oz and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: call it killer green bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was looking at crossing that with
some of your genetics, which would you
[SPEAKER_00]: suggest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers from Warwick.
[SPEAKER_00]: P.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Warwick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great compliment for loving the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even better compliment wanting to breed
with my genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got some seeds that I don't know
what those seeds are.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wizard of Oz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where they came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have done some research,
but honestly that wouldn't help me out too
[SPEAKER_00]: much with my advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would give you the same exact advice
probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you want to use a mail from my
plants or a mail from that pack of seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like have you decided which side is going
to be which?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like which side?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who you're going to use the mail from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who you're going to use the female from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you done any commitment or deciding
or any dedication to which side is which?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you thought about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got some seeds who has some
wizard of Oz.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to grow the wizard of
Oz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to have to grow some of
my seeds and we'll talk about which ones
[SPEAKER_00]: later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow that wizard of Oz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find a good boy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find a good female?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there something you like in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: What stands out about that plant that
makes you want to breed with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: It all boils down to where I'm headed with
this is what is your goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're breeding cannabis plants,
one of your main objectives, one of your
[SPEAKER_00]: main things to think about is what is the
goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your purpose here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you breeding these plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that you want to breed with
my stuff because you like something about
[SPEAKER_00]: my brand makes you want to breed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that, but what makes you want
to breed with these particular plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's got to be a goal in mind when
you're breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be, I want to make some hot fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great idea, but what traits make
hot fire in your opinion?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is a good pie?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's a good cake in your opinion?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you are being a chef now,
you're the one mixing shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you trying to bake?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to make pizza,
then we don't need to order.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're making pizza, we need to order
cheese and pizza sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're making cakes, we need to order
totally different shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need any cheese and pizza sauce
in our cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say grow, start off, grow some of
these, what are they called?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wizard of Oz, kill a green bud seeds and
see what you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find a stellar male?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find a stellar female?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a plant in there that talks to
you that just says, I am a standout
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that as a breeder, as a passionate
cannabis grower, as somebody that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: around these plants and seen them express
themselves so many different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see plants and I go that right there is
something you should breed with and that
[SPEAKER_00]: intuition will kick in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So learn about Mendel charts, learn about
alial charts, learn all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then build some intuition on which plants
to breed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then grow these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a male or female that gets your
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them, have a clone of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep a mother plant of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow it several times, build a
relationship with that plant so you
[SPEAKER_00]: understand how it reacts in response to
different feedings, different conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: different stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn it very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then think about what your goal is.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that plant have that it would
mix well with?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that plant missing that you want
to maybe correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: What could you improve upon with that
plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: What turps are going to mix well with that
plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: What structure will combine well with that
plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what is your goal is something I keep
saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the flavors,
the aromas, the structure, the potency,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anything about the plant that
you're starting with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you've got to grow it,
test it, find the keeper that you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll breed with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what is your goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to make something really tall
and skinny that takes 77 to 85 days to
[SPEAKER_00]: flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you want the opposite?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want something short and squatty
that finishes in 55 to 63 days?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want something that will rip your
brain apart the first time you smoke it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You take two rips off of it and it feels
like your head just exploded and beams of
[SPEAKER_00]: light came out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're fucking panicking and paranoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you want to take two fat rips and
just melt into the couch and be part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the couch?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about your goal, so it's really
hard for me to tell you what to breed with
[SPEAKER_00]: because I don't know your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're trying to make
pizzas, I don't know if you're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: make apple pie, so I'm not sure what
ingredients to send for you from the
[SPEAKER_00]: store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I can really kind of guide you
through is turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want strawberry turps?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want orange turps?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want funky blueberry skittly kind
of turps?
[SPEAKER_00]: What other turps should I write down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you just want pure gas and funky stank?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can steer you in directions with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I've got strains that are kind
of obviously labeled for that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want strawberries, strawberry
starburst would be the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want orangey orange turps,
sun kiss would be the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get it, orangegasm would be the
way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you get orangegasm, you're locked
into either using the orangegasm as the
[SPEAKER_00]: female side of the cross because it's a
feminized seed or you've got to find a
[SPEAKER_00]: good orangegasm, reverse it, use that as
your pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that puts you on a track for your
breeding that does kind of make some
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions there for you when you use a
feminized cross on one side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Side rant, it is totally fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do it all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can breed to a feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a seed, it was feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works just like any other plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could breed to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can mother plant that bad bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works just like the other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have some weird rumors,
myths, misconceptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's whack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not real.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works just like other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only difference was it was female for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so if you're looking for certain
flavors, certain turps, I can help you
[SPEAKER_00]: with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, there's orange, there's
strawberry, there's blueberry funkiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got garlic stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got like skunky, gassy, dirty feet
kind of shit that I can recommend you
[SPEAKER_00]: breed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the double dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want the garlicky stuff,
use the dark hollow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of my stuff is very, the names kind
of give you a good hint of what the
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors are going to be like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry, there's blueberry butchers,
going to taste like blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are lemon jeffries going to taste
like lemons.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon sunrise tastes like lemons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give you pretty strong hints with my
turp profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you looking for super high THC?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of my stuff will give you
super high THC but I'd probably recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: using like an Arise or a Sonic Boom male
to get that really high THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or anything with the Jack the Ripper
crosses would contribute to super high
[SPEAKER_00]: THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But along with that will come a longer
flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are things you have to negotiate
with when it comes to breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you will find outliers in the
phenotypes and then find an outlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find one that came from Sativa dominant
heavy genetics that were bred together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find one that flowers in a short time and
breed to that one again and breed to that
[SPEAKER_00]: one and keep finding short flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get that Sativa dominant short
flowering thing which is kind of what I
[SPEAKER_00]: think they did with Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I'm on a ramble there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you looking for more of a Sativa or
Indica outcome in your cross?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want more Sativa stuff,
I would say go with like the Jack the
[SPEAKER_00]: Ripper crosses or straight up Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want more Indica stuff,
I would say use a Morning Dew,
[SPEAKER_00]: a Dark Hollow, or maybe a Double Dose as a
female or maybe even a male in one of your
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really all about your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said earlier, do you want a longer or
shorter flowering project?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want them to finish in 55-63 or do
you want those 80-day flower plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go longer, I would say use
something the Jack the Ripper stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said that before, that Jack the
Ripper stuff goes for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Morning Dew, the Prana, the Sun Kiss,
those finish a little bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want some quicker, finishing stuff,
that's what I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, it's hard for me to recommend
what to breed to your Wizard of Oz because
[SPEAKER_00]: first off, I don't know what the Wizard of
Oz is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it looks like,
smells like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if I had a good written
description of it, if it said here that it
[SPEAKER_00]: smells like pine trees and grows like
this, how do I know that that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype you're going to get?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you selected a phenotype that smells
like bubblegum and gets real tall and
[SPEAKER_00]: skinny and I don't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to decide what to tell you to
cross it with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to get different
phenotypes from my crosses as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things will get, if you cross
something that's real strawberry and
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's real gassy, some
phenotypes are going to lean real
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some phenotypes are going to lean real gas
and guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some be strawberry gas, perfect up the
middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get others that are
totally random shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get bubblegum and turpentine out of
some of them, but that's just outliers
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's how genetics and nature
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing stopping you from breeding
with multiple female plants at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get one dude and as long as that
one dude makes enough pollen, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate as many females that are in the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I allegedly have a greenhouse going right
now with King Solomon sitting right in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's actually, he served his purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did his job.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made a fucking mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's pregnant.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would Tracy Morgan do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: He got everyone pregnant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they pregnant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't do a good Tracy Morgan on the
spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't prepared, but you know what I'm
saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone got pregnant tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Tracy Morgan.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got everybody pregnant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not Tracy Morgan, King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got everybody pregnant in that
greenhouse and he got one too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he pollinated 12 other,
he pollinated 12 female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are 12 outdoor plants got
pollinated by one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I go indoors, I usually do one male
per one or two lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a light of female plants and
one male plant per light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe sometimes two, depending on how big
the overall plants are, how big the dude
[SPEAKER_00]: is, but I'll put several females to King
Solomon most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or several females to Jack the Ripper or
several females to a reversed golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you can make multiple things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that way you run those multiples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you put, let's for example,
say we put your, let's just take the
[SPEAKER_00]: Wizard of Oz male and we'll pollinate
Strawberry Starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll pollinate Sunkiss and then we'll
also pollinate Jack the Ripper and we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: grow seeds from all of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've grown the Strawberry Starburst,
the Sunkiss and the Jack the Ripper times
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to where we know what they do when
you grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know how they respond and react to
different environments, feedings,
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, abuses, stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what they're resistant to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what they're really susceptible
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how long they take to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know those plants very well,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a relationship with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we cross them with your male Wizard
of Oz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you grow the seeds that come from
those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get to see what the male is
doing to each different cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we see that normally the Strawberry
Starburst was tall and had skinny leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: and long lanky buds and smells like
strawberries and the Sunkiss is kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not as tall, but it's got that
rounder structure and the wide plant
[SPEAKER_00]: structure and smells like oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we grow out the progeny that came
from those crosses and we see that they
[SPEAKER_00]: both have a spicy apple flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that your Wizard of Oz is
contributing a spicy apple turp to
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of one of his traits,
what we know he does.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you test out a male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only real way to test out a boy
is to pollinate a bunch of things,
[SPEAKER_00]: grow them and then find commonalities
amongst those different crosses to find
[SPEAKER_00]: out what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I know so well what my King
Solomon plant does to other plants when I
[SPEAKER_00]: cross it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very predictable for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight out of ten times by now,
I can say if we hit that plant with King
[SPEAKER_00]: Solomon, it's going to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can predict it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll write it down on paper and I'll say,
bro, we're gonna get this out of it and
[SPEAKER_00]: then we'll do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoever I'll pollinate the plants,
I'll give seeds to people and I'll say,
[SPEAKER_00]: expect this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch out for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll message me back.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be like, bro, I thought you said
it's a test or you never grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you know what it was gonna do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be like, well, I know both the
parents so well that I know that
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry Starburst grows tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: She gets skinny around week six.
[SPEAKER_00]: She starts yellowing up real bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to give her extra nutrients,
but don't because you'll burn her.
[SPEAKER_00]: She just kind of yellows out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what she does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I know that this other plant over
here around week nine, it really starts
[SPEAKER_00]: beefing up so that I know that the
offspring around week seven, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: probably gonna get yellow and beef up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the kind of math that my brain
understands how to do with these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're my kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that that one is gonna be an honry
bitch one night and that one's gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: really a pain in the ass in the mornings,
but Saturday morning, they're gonna get
[SPEAKER_00]: along.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how the plants are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell them what the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They talk to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tell me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I feel like I've been rambling
for a very long time about this one,
[SPEAKER_00]: but honestly, breeding is all about your
purpose and your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breed with intent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breed with purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Challenge yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter which plants you use,
just get a piece of paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And write down, I'm going to cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just being hypothetical.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use any plants in your garden that
you choose to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got my permission, my blessing,
my honor to breed with my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of you guys out there, gals out there,
anybody that wants to play with my seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and do some pollen chucking, please do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you make a seed company out of it,
give me some credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say, learn some shit from Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I encourage you to breed with my
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing is that you've got a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I told you I took some fat
daps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I finally remember what the fuck I was
saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had to ramble it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have cut some of the rambling out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the magic of editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I better say it before I fucking
forget what I was saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, here's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're going to do some breeding and
you've got the blessings to breed with my
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, your plants, whatever plants you
want to choose, nobody should say you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't breed with their seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you buy them, they're yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But write down, I'm going to breed my
Wizard of Oz to Strawberry Starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to breed Wizard of Oz to Cindy
99.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to breed Wizard of Oz to
something from Colin and something from
[SPEAKER_00]: Miss Jill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just breed it to a bunch of different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But write down your expected outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's called your hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down your predictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I'm going to put this Wizard of Oz
to Strawberry Starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping I get high potency Strawberry
Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then think of what like may kind of
not be the super coolest trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's going to have like a negative
trait to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what's the downside to all these
bonus traits?
[SPEAKER_00]: See where that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just see what you can predict.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every time you breed again,
keep writing down your predictions and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll start seeing what you can do and
what you can predict and what you can rely
[SPEAKER_00]: on and what the plants do repeatedly over
and over when you breed with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll learn this dude is great
to breed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: This girl plant is good to breed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you'll start playing with different
male plants and you'll start seeing what
[SPEAKER_00]: different boy and girl combinations do to
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll realize this male and this
female work real well together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I breed this male and this female
together, it doesn't work worth a shit for
[SPEAKER_00]: some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find combos that are magical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some that are mediocre and some that
you wish you never made because you end up
[SPEAKER_00]: throwing away big baggies filled with
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You feed them to the birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You flush them down the toilet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give those to your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've rambled on for extra time but
I needed to on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your name in this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: I already fucking lost your name in this
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Warwick.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: My bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've got any follow up questions,
I would love to talk more about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me some more details and maybe we can
steer you on the right path.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get you down the right track.
[SPEAKER_00]: But man just follow your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow from your heart and breed with love
brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I really think you should and
need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breed these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow these plants out.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what speaks to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're like you're like the
matchmaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the guy on the dating game.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to set them up and hope they
get along.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are the new plant tender.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I do have one more message in front of
me that I'm going to read on this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message right here comes from my
friend Squirrel Master.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up Squirrel Master.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you are well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being a part of the iry
army.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to have you on team iry
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message from my buddy Squirrel Master
goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm sorry if I've asked this
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude I've done 600.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 675.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you already did hopefully everybody
forgot because I did so did you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully everybody's smoking as much as
we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any who.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any how.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Squirrel Master.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should get that tattoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tattooed on your forearms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your arms like this together and then
get this is Squirrel Master.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tattooed on your forearms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be fucking gnarly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up Squirrel Master.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I was wondering about light leaks
and interruptions in the vegetative phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will this affect a vegging plant to the
point where it causes herming or other
[SPEAKER_00]: things when the plants are flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light interruptions during veg won't be
major and catastrophic.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do it on purpose multiple times the
plant may start tripping out on you and
[SPEAKER_00]: may show you some frustration some
hormonal problems but you can basically
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulate that light pretty well a couple
of times in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you want to go from like maybe you
want to completely change the schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah do it one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll go what the fuck was that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they'll just keep growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do it like today and then again in
three days and again in a few days they
[SPEAKER_00]: may start getting weird shaped leaves
because they're just not sure what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll react just like you bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once or twice they'll be like what the
fuck was that and they'll get right back
[SPEAKER_00]: on track but if you do it a few times
they're gonna want to talk to the manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna be like what the fuck is
going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you keep waking me up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why am I sleeping?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then why are the lights back on and why is
it sunshiny at three in the morning what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do it a couple times mess with
them a little bit in veg they will be
[SPEAKER_00]: okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to get them back on a good day night
cycle a good rhythm before you put them
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower so that they know like oh I've
been on 18 six and they kind of have an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea and then when you switch to 12 12
they'll notice the big oh now it's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually 12 12 because if you have a
chaotic schedule chaos chaos then you go
[SPEAKER_00]: to 12 12 they're gonna be confused they'll
take a little bit longer I would expect
[SPEAKER_00]: for them to realize oh that's really 12 12
I really should go into bloom so I would
[SPEAKER_00]: give them minimal interruptions as close
to flower as possible but I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: that it will cause major problems major
concerns now in the flowering phase I
[SPEAKER_00]: would really try to avoid light leaks at
all costs I don't want light leaks light
[SPEAKER_00]: interruption schedule changes I really try
to keep that locked in once I'm in the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering phase that is where you will see
issues you possibly will lead to intersex
[SPEAKER_00]: expressions of your plants you'll start
seeing possible reef edge start seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: possible twisty coily leaves maybe slow
the real word is retarded growth don't
[SPEAKER_00]: flag me for that one that's the real word
the plant the growth of the plant will be
[SPEAKER_00]: retarded because the light schedule is
interrupted I won't look like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: blooming the way that it should you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: think you're in a flowering stage but
since you're getting the major part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: show I wanted to get through now it is
