Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode 738 of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I'm going to focus on a
grow question about flowering our plants
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I get to that part of the show,

[SPEAKER_01]: then let's wrap it all up with a big Grow
From Your Heart podcast thank you shout
[SPEAKER_01]: out to Thor's Trike Factory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks and big shout out to everybody
who continues to support the show on
[SPEAKER_01]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are not already supporting the show
and you would like to learn how to do so,
[SPEAKER_01]: all you have to do is visit www.patreon
.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I do include a link in the
show notes and in the video description to
[SPEAKER_01]: make it nice and easy for all of my
friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: to support the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of Patreon, I did have the honor,
the privilege, the pleasure, whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: other peace starting words you want to
throw in there to record a Patreon podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: with my buddy Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, it was an honor,
a privilege, a privileged Patreon podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just exaggerating now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did record a Patreon only podcast with
my buddy Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike came over recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sat here for two or three hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ate a bunch of edibles and we did a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did not cover any Grow Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: We made sure not to cover Grow Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to waste Grow Talk on the
Patreon only episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are watching this, check out the
Patreon episode where Mike and I eat some
[SPEAKER_01]: edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get lit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not already on the Patreon,
now is the time to join the Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike and I do eat a hundred milligrams of
edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: We smoked a lot of dabs, smoked a lot of
flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike got a little quiet toward the end of
the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was super lit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will be a Patreon only episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: My point is we did not do any Grow content
in that episode because I've promised the
[SPEAKER_01]: listeners that I will keep Grow Talk grow
content free.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want everybody to be able to grow the
best product we possibly can grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical patients need the best product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recreational consumers need the best
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to be able to grow the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to put that behind a paywall.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want the grow lessons, the education to
be free.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we did was we gave the patrons a
bonus episode of just hanging out,
[SPEAKER_01]: getting lit, kind of connecting with us,
chilling out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you will enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you watch that, please send me some
feedback because we want to do more of
[SPEAKER_01]: those episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, thank you to Mike for popping
in and doing the Patreon episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do encourage you, invite you,
implore you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the word I'm looking for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check out the Patreon and check out the
video that I recorded with Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be up at the beginning of the month
of May.
[SPEAKER_01]: The patrons for the month of May will get
that video.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to provide a Patreon
video once a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may contain Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may just be me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows what could happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me your ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's quit rambling about Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said that I've got a Grow question here
in front of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outdoor season is quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Likely coming upon us.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are setting up their plants
indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people at least are vegging their
plants indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to veg indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're doing it correctly, last year
you ran some seeds or got some clones or
[SPEAKER_01]: got a plant from somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you grew that and you made sure that
it is quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you grew from seed, hopefully you
eliminated the boys, you eliminated
[SPEAKER_01]: anything intersex, you eliminated anything
problematic, and you have found a gem of a
[SPEAKER_01]: keeper that you want to put outside this
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've done your research, done your
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a quality plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: To put outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now people are vegging those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people have been vegging since
January.
[SPEAKER_01]: They started their clone, their seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, they want to do it since January.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting big.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've now sexed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've made sure it's a female.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a clone of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know what they've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting bigger and bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to put it outside pretty
soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to see on social media,
a lot of people saying that they put their
[SPEAKER_01]: plants outside and immediately when they
put them outside, they went into flower
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're going to go into flower too
early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then those plants are going to go back
into veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to continue a little bit of
a veg cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then once they get settled into that veg
phase, mother nature out there is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: adjust to the actual flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they will want the plants to go into
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll go into flower and they're going
to be weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be upset.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to be the quality which
they could have been if we timed this
[SPEAKER_01]: better, if we understood what was going
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going to happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are going to take their
plants from their grow room where they're
[SPEAKER_01]: giving them 18 hours of light,
18 and six, maybe more, maybe 24 hours of
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're getting a direct light from an
LED or an HPS or maybe it's just a T5.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're getting a lot of direct light
out there and they're not getting any
[SPEAKER_01]: stressors and you're giving them a solid
light schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to take them outside
because you think by looking at the sun
[SPEAKER_01]: and the sky that we're getting more than
12 hours of light outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those plants should continue to veg
outdoors is what a lot of people think.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes that doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is because of a couple of
factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have an email that I want to read.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will set me up to get further into
this topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may skim through this because there is a
lot of this email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not all necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our friend is as long-winded as myself
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me try to edit this and we'll make
something out of this message.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, bro, I really appreciate the way
you do what you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are a positive light and you are
contagious.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody taught me a long time ago that
smiles are contagious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody also taught me that don't
complain because nobody gives a shit and
[SPEAKER_01]: it makes people just not want to be around
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So try to smile, try to have the good
vibes, especially when a camera is on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reason to come on a camera when
I'm in a bad mood, not having a good vibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have bad days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit does happen in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't share that with the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no need to put that shit out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just shed love and light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that you noticed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you like the way I do what I do
because I'm just doing it the way I know
[SPEAKER_01]: how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't change it if I tried.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says you are an extremely thorough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are extremely thorough in the way you
teach.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I'm pretty stoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I might have something for you
to riff on here and pretty much never gets
[SPEAKER_01]: covered by anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've read this email.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are very correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: This does not get covered by a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people don't understand this
concept, this phenomena here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a phenomenon, a phenomena?
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have did that research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should have learned the words,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I speak a lot of English.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should know the words.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody does talk about this a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate that you think I am a
thorough teacher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes people say that I will repeat
myself and beat a subject into the ground
[SPEAKER_01]: too many times.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because there are different types
of learners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people learn visually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people learn hands on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people learn by being told.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people have to have the combination
of all three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people need shit literally beaten
into them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try to approach a topic, multiple
different directions, give a few different
[SPEAKER_01]: ways to learn the same thing because there
are a lot of people watching the show and
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of people learning from,
they have different learning styles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make sure to get everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that stoners have ADD.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all, we didn't like school because we
had somebody just lecturing us about some
[SPEAKER_01]: shit we didn't care about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we all like to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're passionately curious about stuff we
care about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just didn't care about a lot of the shit
in school.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am rambling.
[SPEAKER_01]: This goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I want to say something about the
process by which cannabis plants
[SPEAKER_01]: transition themselves from a vegetative
stage to a flowering stage outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a very good conversation to be had
at this time of year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I think, and he has think in
capital letters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it is right to call this thing
that happens as a trait, just like the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering time is a trait that can vary
between sisters.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flower trigger event varies greatly as
well from plant to plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my experience anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically the equatorial sativa dominant
varietals can be put up to a month earlier
[SPEAKER_01]: than your indica heavy varietals with no
chance of early flower and a resulting
[SPEAKER_01]: revage, but not always.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a great topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you haven't followed along to what this
person is saying, they are addressing the
[SPEAKER_01]: fact that some plants, so there are traits
in our plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me back up and cover a couple of
things that he said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aroma is a trait of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potency is a trait of the plant,
a characteristic, an attribute of that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flowering time is a trait of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a thing that we haven't talked
about a lot in the podcast space,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is called the critical period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Critical period is also a trait within the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe, I think that you are correct
that what is known as the critical period
[SPEAKER_01]: is a trait for each plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what my friend is talking about is
when we put some plants outside,
[SPEAKER_01]: they will flower sooner than other plants
put outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put a heavy indica plant and a
heavy sativa plant outside, they will
[SPEAKER_01]: begin to flower at different times because
those plants are from different parts of
[SPEAKER_01]: the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in one part of the world, they had more
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the other part of the world,
it got dark sooner and those plants just
[SPEAKER_01]: adapted to that environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Evolution did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was just years and years of evolution
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it was breeding, maybe it was
evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we've got autoflower plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Autoflower has naturally happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think about in Alaska, there are
time periods for months and months and
[SPEAKER_01]: months where they don't get dark,
but these plants are growing and the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants finally said, hey, I'm just going
to fucking flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to give me any dark time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm tired of growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: A cannabis plant's main goal is to
reproduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main goal of our cannabis plant,
its goal, not our goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We prevent this from happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis plant's main goal is to
produce a seed, drop that seed into the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground to continue its generation next
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's life next year, the next filial
generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We interrupt that process by pulling all
the males out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't allow the pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't allow the seeds to happen,
but cannabis plant's main goal is to get
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: The female's main goal is to get
pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: The male's main goal is to shoot that
pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like people, one of our main goals is
to fucking procreate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That plant will do everything it can to
procreate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they say in Jurassic Park,
life will find a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Life does find a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had these plants in Alaska.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we, they, them, somebody, there were
plants in Alaska.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They never got dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: These plants went, hey, it's not going to
get dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had a meeting and they just
fucking decided to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And through years and years of evolution,
those plants just learned that it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to get dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to do it on our own.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we got auto flower plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is a trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of our cannabis plants have a similar
trait, which is known, I'm circling back,
[SPEAKER_01]: as the critical period.
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I talking about the critical
period?
[SPEAKER_01]: The critical period is the amount of
continuous dark hours that it would take
[SPEAKER_01]: to trigger our plant into a flowering
phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, most of us are going to say that's 12
hours, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, kinda, but the plants weren't
naturally doing 12 hours of darkness and
[SPEAKER_01]: they would flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're doing indoors because
that's what worked with the equipment that
[SPEAKER_01]: we had, the lights we were working with,
the plants that we happened to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our forefathers, my uncles, maybe my
uncle's uncles, probably my uncles,
[SPEAKER_01]: were the guys responsible for selecting
all of those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they realized we've got to force them
to flower by putting them in darkness.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they probably just reduced the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, well, let's give it four
hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It never flowered.
[SPEAKER_01]: They gave it six, it didn't flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually somebody realized when I give
it 12, it flowers every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, did we select plants that flower
under that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did we breed at that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is that a natural thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: So these plants, if we leave them
outdoors, this is where this is going.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we put these plants outdoors,
the plants are going to flower at
[SPEAKER_01]: different times.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would happen, you'll see it happen
naturally indoors, but it's not as drastic
[SPEAKER_01]: because we've bred these plants to all be
grown indoors under these indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've kind of bred the plants to work
with the rooms now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't make the rooms work for the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got so many varieties and so many
different things in the room that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding the plants to work for the rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need the plants to work in 74 to 84
degrees with like 30 to 70% humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's a huge range, but that's what
we're breeding them for, to work in those
[SPEAKER_01]: environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something that naturally happens with
the plants is outdoors and all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, indoors and outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see it indoors, not as drastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put a strong indica and a strong
sativa next to each other and put them on
[SPEAKER_01]: 12-12 lighting, they will flower at
different rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll notice the indica plant kicks into
flower a little bit sooner.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sativa plant takes a little bit
longer to kick into flower, but once it
[SPEAKER_01]: does, it really gets going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it takes 16 weeks to finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: That indica plant will be done eight or
nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is a critical, it's called the
critical period, the amount of darkness
[SPEAKER_01]: which it takes to trigger that plant into
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants will go into flower with 13
hours of darkness.
[SPEAKER_01]: DJ Short teaches us to do 11 on 13 off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants will go into flower with 14
hours of darkness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them will go with 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done all the breeding to where most
of the plants work with 12-12.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also they'll work with 11-13 either
direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's talk about outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outdoors we have some anomalies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've all noticed this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We look outside, we got our clock,
we got our timer, we got our watch,
[SPEAKER_01]: we see the sun come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was seven o'clock.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see the sun go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's eight 30.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're obviously getting more than 12 hours
of daylight outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting 14 or 15 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is safe to put our plants out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people move the plants out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They think it's warm enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in Colorado, wait a little
longer, it's going to hail on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get your plants beat to
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are going to go out early.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to say, I've got 14 hours of
daylight.
[SPEAKER_01]: After those plants are outside for a few
days, they are going to begin to flower
[SPEAKER_01]: and people are going to be very confused.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a few things that are happening
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, you just went from an 18-6
or a 24 hour light cycle straight outside
[SPEAKER_01]: to less lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants are confused.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to go into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of stressed them out, kind of shocked
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just how they want to survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going, something's wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: We better flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just want to procreate before the end
of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: They think the world might end.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just trying to get pregnant or
make something pregnant at that very last
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is why they start flowering
possibly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just went from that indoor light cycle
to the outdoor light cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so different.
[SPEAKER_01]: They freaked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's another thing that is happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are thinking we're getting 14 hours of
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, when the sun sets, as the sun
begins to set, you may see this with your
[SPEAKER_01]: eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may not see this with your eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may notice that the sky gets a little
bit orange, a little bit red as the sun
[SPEAKER_01]: sets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as the sun sets, it puts off a red
spectrum, which is known as far red.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that spectrum tells the plants it is
time to go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: That triggers something within the plant
called phytochrome red.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that phytochrome red is basically the
way that the far red and phytochrome work
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they touch, that is basically Nyquil
or Ambien for your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes, night, night, bitches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they go, oh, look, far red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's trigger phytochrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just puts the plants to sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that triggers them to go to sleep
earlier than when that darkness happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the indoor grow, unless you've got one
of those new lights with the far red
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting, which they just started adding a
couple of years ago, big up to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But until then, we did not have far red
lighting indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to turn off the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point, the plants were not
asleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes them an hour or two to actually
fall asleep completely and begin their
[SPEAKER_01]: dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: The night cycle process takes a little bit
to kick in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they couldn't kick that in until an
hour or two after we actually put them to
[SPEAKER_01]: sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was interrupted by a delivery.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am back on track now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not remember where I was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I was talking about phytochrome
red.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking about the different plants
going into flower at different rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not exactly sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to jump in right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are growing sativas.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are growing indicas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people are growing straight hybrids
at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of your sativas are going to take 16
weeks ish to fill to finish out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're real, that's what I mean by a
sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of your indica stuff is your eight or
nine, maybe maybe the 10 week or stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: with that big fat leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the indica stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to notice that some of those
plants will go into flower earlier
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoors and some will go into flower
later outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is called the critical period.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to get that critical period of
the right amount of darkness for each
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to be dependent on where
that plant came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did the parent plants come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which part of the world did that plant
start from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now with all the breeding, you've got
plants that are, they got parents from all
[SPEAKER_01]: over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just kind of depends on which
phenotype it leans toward.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have some notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make sure I get onto all my
notes here because I haven't looked at my
[SPEAKER_01]: notes at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just been talking off the top of my
head.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're talking about here is the
critical period.
[SPEAKER_01]: This could be very different between
different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a pack of seeds and you put
them outside one Mayflower, much earlier
[SPEAKER_01]: than the other, that is just different
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all about the genetic location and
origin of that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I was just talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did that plant come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a plant that came from
Alaska, it may auto flower on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants may flower as soon as you give
them a little bit of darkness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some may need a lot more darkness to
trigger into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just going to be genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just like a lot of other parts of
our plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the plants want more Kalamag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they want more nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they need more dark,
period.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we've got auto flower plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I touched on that at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're auto flower plants because up in
Alaska, it just wasn't getting dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Up there in certain parts of Russia,
it wasn't getting dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants were just like, hey,
we got to do something, dude, or we're
[SPEAKER_01]: just not going to be able to get to the
party.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted to party just like we all do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We chose 12-12 because that seems to be
what works for most plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I touched on a minute ago,
you can do 11-13 either direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: 11 on, 11 off, 13 on, 13 off.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you got a 24-hour light cycle
right there, you could do 11-13.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen 10-14 both directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about trying it with your plants
and what works best for your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, you've heard me talk about
switching my light cycle to 18-6 at the
[SPEAKER_01]: end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people think that when I talk
about experimenting with my plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about doing this in like a 25
by 25 room with fucking 25 lights in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not how I do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm doing experiments, I do in a
little teeny tiny space where I can't ruin
[SPEAKER_01]: a whole bunch of shit at one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get one light and a few plants and just
experiment with those.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to get better.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to learn anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to advance, improve.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we don't practice, try and fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to have some failures and some
successes to become better at anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's growing weed, if it's
skateboarding, if it's playing music,
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's karate, if it's ballet,
whatever you're doing, you've got to fail
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to learn everything the hard way.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have some failures,
you're not going to learn anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do a lot of experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But don't do it in your big space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do that all in a small space and a small
practice area.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't practice, if you don't try
new shit, you're not going to learn
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to fail occasionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done full podcast episodes about
mistakes that I've made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid to make some mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is more to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think that as lighting and equipment
evolves, I think that light cycles will
[SPEAKER_01]: evolve as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen other people playing with
different light cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since we're getting the proper light,
the proper spectrum, we've got far red
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got all kind of, we can cover just
about any color of lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can replicate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any color spectrum, we can make that with
expensive lighting or affordable lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think as the lighting evolves,
so will some of the schedules.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're able to give the plants all the
photons, all the energy that it needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that'll let it get more sleeping time
because it's getting the DLI, which I need
[SPEAKER_01]: to do a podcast about DLI, but there's
some equations to be done that I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: understand all the math, but I know what
it means if that makes any sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the technology, the plants will
be getting their DLI, which means we'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to give them maybe longer sleep
periods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows how it'll work out, but we're
going to learn a lot more with the
[SPEAKER_01]: evolution of technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did say that a lot of the gear we have,
a lot of the plants we have, a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: selections we have now are because of our
forefathers who did not have the best
[SPEAKER_01]: technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't have the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't have power meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't have led lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've come so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also they didn't have legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got legalization on our side.
[SPEAKER_01]: They couldn't even talk about growing
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're going to grow weed,
they didn't have the internet to do
[SPEAKER_01]: research.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't have a bro to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just had to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hope not to get busted and see how it
goes and try again.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were learning it all from scratch.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a little spoiled now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to say we're blessed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're cheating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day, you had to be secretive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't have the internet and it was
not legal at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we got the fucking internet and it's
legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are cheating.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think there will be a lot of
evolution in the technology, in the
[SPEAKER_01]: growing, in light cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that we've got more technology and
legalization and the internet on our side,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've covered up all of my notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked about far red.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked about fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked about cytochrome red.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said that's basically plant sleeping
pills.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about the opposite end of that
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the morning, the plant, the sun puts
off a bluish colored light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And guess what that one does?
[SPEAKER_01]: That works like an alarm clock.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, wake up bitches.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is time to get moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wakes up all your plants and they
get the day started.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the blue light that comes from the
sunrise.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get the blue and the sunrise,
the red and the sunset.
[SPEAKER_01]: That dictates a lot of the plant's
movement and actions through the rest of
[SPEAKER_01]: the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is all I've got for you for
my question about critical period.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I skipped a lot of this question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just used it kind of as a springboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did he say his name?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, his name is Taj.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my buddy Taj.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do appreciate the great message,
the great content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to hear all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also make sure you check out the website
at iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a link to the new and improved and
updated Discord server on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do invite you to join the new Discord
server.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were on the old Discord,
some things went haywire on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That server has been, it's no longer an
iregenetics server.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be running as a different server.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not involved in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Join my new real server.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a link in the show notes and in
the video description.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I think that is all I've got
for you for this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be back in a couple of days with
fresh new content.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a giant shout out to my
friend, James Bean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mom a hug for me.
See you next time.
