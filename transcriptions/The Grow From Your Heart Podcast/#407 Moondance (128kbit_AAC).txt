[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 407 of the Grow From
Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by our friends at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds in your garden,
I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can find them at www
.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has become a tradition that we start
the podcast off by talking about what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of GG4 batter
from our friends at Apothecary Farms,
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love the flavor and aroma of this
batter, and I really love the lung
[SPEAKER_00]: expansion from a nice batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm excited to be
back on the microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't recorded an episode in a couple
of weeks, so it feels wonderful to be in
[SPEAKER_00]: front of the computer and behind the
microphone, and it really feels great to
[SPEAKER_00]: be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everybody enjoyed those long grow
lessons I reposted, I hope we got your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden up in tip-top shape, and I really
hope you enjoyed the lesson with Mike and
[SPEAKER_00]: I to top it all off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a great time while I was away from
the microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to go see Bert Kreischer at the
Paramount Theater in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also got to go visit our friends,
Scotty Reel and Guru from the Dude Grows
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was honored to be invited as a guest
onto their podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time this episode comes out,
I'm sure you will be able to catch my
[SPEAKER_00]: episode of the Dude Grows show on YouTube,
on iTunes, or anywhere you find a
[SPEAKER_00]: respectable podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you give the Dude Grows show
a follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to all of
my friends at the Dude Grows show.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big shout out to Scotty, a big shout out
to Guru, a big shout out to JR Token,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also a huge shout out, of course,
to my friend the Dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks again for having me on the Dude
Grows show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a great time on the podcast,
I had a lot of fun, and I had a really
[SPEAKER_00]: good time hanging out with Scotty Reel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for the hospitality,
and I look forward to doing it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now since we're talking about the Dude
Grows show, let's talk about the Dude
[SPEAKER_00]: Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dude Grows Cup is coming April 13th at
Cultivated Synergy in Denver, Colorado.

[SPEAKER_00]: an email to growfromyourheartathotmail
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make sure to link you up with the
Dude, and we will get you all of the info
[SPEAKER_00]: you need about the Dude Grows Cup in
Denver in April.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to seeing everybody there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I do plan on reading a
couple of listener emails, but before we
[SPEAKER_00]: get there, I owe a couple of my friends a
shout out from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big shout out to Richard
Goles, a shout out to Richard Memel,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a giant Viking handshake to my friend
Grimble the Druid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you'd like to learn more about
becoming a Patreon contributor,
[SPEAKER_00]: all you need to do is go to patreon.com
slash growfromyourheart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: As promised, it is time to jump into some
listener emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love answering questions from the
listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a question for me,
you can send it to me at
[SPEAKER_00]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com,
and I will try to work your email into a
[SPEAKER_00]: future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first email on today's episode goes a
lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that is a great way to start an
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love hearing that I'm helping people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that you love the compilations,
and I love that you think I am the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm honestly not in competition with
anybody, but when you're told the best,
[SPEAKER_00]: it honestly makes all of the work and all
of the effort worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for starting out with a huge
compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, I have got one question slash
comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, what is the basis for the really
hard insistence on having absolutely no
[SPEAKER_00]: light during dark periods and flowering?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he quotes me by saying, if you can
see your hand in front of your face after
[SPEAKER_00]: five minutes in your grow tent when it's
dark, then that's too much light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do remember saying that, and I still
stand behind that statement, and I will
[SPEAKER_00]: explain why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, from an outdoor grow perspective,
this would never be the case because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the simple fact of moonlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: All outdoor plants deal with significant
moonlight for two or three weeks every
[SPEAKER_00]: month, and a cannabis plant is likely to
have at least two cycles of this during
[SPEAKER_00]: early and late fall, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor grows don't seem to suffer from
this light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the issue?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a natural strike against what's
possible in an outdoor grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just curious about this, and I'm very
interested in what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for the great and generous
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm learning a lot, and I trust what
you're teaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks for the trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is a great question,
and I have a really great answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell that my voice is kind of
burning out, so I'm going to press pause,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm going to get my voice fresh,
and I'm going to come back and give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: solid answer on this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take a dab while I take a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world, I am well
hydrated, and my voice feels fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about why our outdoor cannabis
plants don't have light interruption
[SPEAKER_00]: problems from the moon.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several things that contribute
to this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing is the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we are growing outdoors, we are
growing under the most powerful,
[SPEAKER_00]: most efficient grow light known to man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: This comes into play for a lot of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, as the sun sets, the sun puts
off a spectrum that is known as a far-red
[SPEAKER_00]: light spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this far-red light spectrum is picked
up by our plants by something called
[SPEAKER_00]: phytochrome red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phytochrome red is a protein that works as
kind of a, it has several functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, it is a receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phytochrome red can see that far-red
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It knows that it is what receives far-red
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes, hey, it is my turn to fire up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a phytochrome red little protein,
and I see that far-red light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my turn to do my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: That phytochrome red protein tells the
plant that it is sleepy time, and it makes
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant effectively go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns the plant off for the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that plant is much less susceptible
to light interruptions because the sun put
[SPEAKER_00]: out a far-red spectrum that was received
by a protein inside of the plant called
[SPEAKER_00]: phytochrome red.
[SPEAKER_00]: The function of that phytochrome red is to
start triggering, one of the functions of
[SPEAKER_00]: phytochrome red is to start triggering
that plant to go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is basically, I guess, a good way to
describe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is like when you get one of those
hypnotists, and when you say, when I snap
[SPEAKER_00]: my fingers, you will fall asleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And phytochrome red, far-red, sleepy time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hypnotized, it went to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you need the opposite to wake it
up in the morning, but we're gonna talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about that spectrum in another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to focus here on why we don't
have light interruptions under the moon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main contributing factor is the
sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun is the brightest grow light we
could imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the sun, the brightest light
you could imagine all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun goes down, it puts out the
far-red.
[SPEAKER_00]: That far-red is our second contributing
factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The far-red tells the phytochrome red,
which is factor number three, that it is
[SPEAKER_00]: time to tuck those plants in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now they are sleeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, those three things, that bright,
bright-ass light all day, that phytochrome
[SPEAKER_00]: red, and that far-red are going to put the
plants in such a deep sleep that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to need a significant light
interruption to cause any noticeable
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got to wrap that rant up with one
of my favorite things to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, this is very strain-specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be very phenotype-specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: The moon is not going to disrupt your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, a flashlight or some car
headlights may disrupt some of your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where it becomes plant and
strain-specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are under such a powerful
light all day long, I mean the sun,
[SPEAKER_00]: that your flashlight at night,
probably, and I'm saying probably,
[SPEAKER_00]: will be very insignificant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you hear something out in the garden
and you just shine the flashlight real
[SPEAKER_00]: quick, who's out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably not going to disrupt the
flowering period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our plants are more sensitive to
photoperiod disruption early in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you get peak flowering time,
you don't have as much to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early in flower is where they will be more
sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with this super combination of that
powerful light all day, that far-red
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum telling the plants, hey,
you need to go to sleep, and that
[SPEAKER_00]: phytochrome protein within the plant
saying, hey, you're right, we do need to
[SPEAKER_00]: go to sleep, all of those things working
together should tuck your plants in quite
[SPEAKER_00]: nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now don't get me wrong, enough intense
light at a long enough duration does have
[SPEAKER_00]: the potential to disrupt your outdoor
flowering plants, but it is probably going
[SPEAKER_00]: to take a much more powerful and a much
longer duration of light interruption to
[SPEAKER_00]: cause any problems than it would in an
indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: In an indoor environment, you don't have
the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: In an indoor environment, you are probably
not getting far-red lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some companies have started making red
lighting available to the home grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is uncommon, so most folks don't
have that at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not getting that sun,
you're not getting that far-red,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means you are not getting that
phytochrome red protein, which is telling
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants to go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your plants are kind of napping
indoors, and it takes them a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: longer to actually get to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several times I have been asked,
why do my plants go into flower outdoors
[SPEAKER_00]: before we have reached an actual 12-12
cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone will say, well, I'm getting 14
hours of daylight and my plants have
[SPEAKER_00]: started to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two major contributing factors
that decide when your plant flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is what is known as the
critical period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every plant has a critical period.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means how many hours of continued
darkness does this plant need?
[SPEAKER_00]: Before it starts flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now based on where your plant is from
geographically, it will possibly have a
[SPEAKER_00]: different critical photo period flowering
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some places like Alaska don't get much
darkness ever, so the plants from Alaska
[SPEAKER_00]: have adapted to flower with less dark
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Places like here in Colorado, we get a
really nice night cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants that are from here have
adapted to expect more of a night cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll need to give them more
uninterrupted hours of darkness before
[SPEAKER_00]: they will initiate flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of what modern breeders have bred
will flower under a 12-12 condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we have found works best for
indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't work that way, we have
probably eliminated it by now and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: been removed from the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there are auto flower plants
that will flower under whatever light
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions you put them under because
those are bred from those plants that came
[SPEAKER_00]: from the environments that did not get any
darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the main contributing factors is
what is known as the critical period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the other thing that is contributing
to our outdoor plants flowering with more
[SPEAKER_00]: than 12 hours of daylight time is that
far-red spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, as the sun starts to set,
it puts off that far-red spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun is still up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can still see there's still enough
light illuminating the sky to where we can
[SPEAKER_00]: function.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that far-red spectrum is telling the
plants, hey, I'm starting to activate my
[SPEAKER_00]: phytochrome red protein and it feels like
I want to take a nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they start putting on their night
clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start doing whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're drinking their sleepy time tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're smoking that nighttime joint and
they're getting themselves ready to go to
[SPEAKER_00]: bed even if there is still a little bit of
light out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my long rambly explanation of
why the moon does not cause light
[SPEAKER_00]: interruptions in our outdoor cannabis
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also touched briefly on why our
outdoor plants are beginning to flower
[SPEAKER_00]: when there is still more than 12 hours of
visible daylight.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you once again for a great
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you want me to say your
name on the show, but you know who you
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for a great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for great content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to your next question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody else out there has a grow
question, I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another email in front of me and
it goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff in advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to thank you for any advice
that you have to give.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have recently installed a mini split
system in my small grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mini split is overkill, but for my
circumstance, it's more stealth than a
[SPEAKER_00]: window unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I understand that completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also says I covered the green light
display sufficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought and I ran my new seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: My Bodhi seeds did great.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got some seeds from Bodhi who is a
great breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friend Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said those seeds did great.
[SPEAKER_00]: No hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: The freebies that came with the Chem
Keezie were labeled diesel Pakistani.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the diesel Pakistani hermed on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys, when we say it hermed on
him, that means at some point in the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering phase, that female plant decided
to display male parts, which means that
[SPEAKER_00]: that male flower can produce pollen,
which can pollinate your female crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will put seeds in the whole female
crop, which lessens the quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: lessens the potency, lessens the
desirability, and kind of ruins the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: project unless you wanted seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the diesel Pakistani has become
a hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message continues to say I have
always just sat for a few minutes in my
[SPEAKER_00]: dark room to notice the most obvious of
light leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take your advice and I hang out in the
room for 20 to 30 minutes to ensure there
[SPEAKER_00]: are no obvious light leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the green light display leaking
through the top of the mini split?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that that super dim green
light could have caused the hermaphrodite?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should the whole room have hermaphrodited
or would it be more likely to be an
[SPEAKER_00]: unstable diesel strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more diesel Pakistani to
double check in the back corner and I just
[SPEAKER_00]: can't really get a good look at the lower
limbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm unsure if all of the diesel
Pakistani have become hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wraps up the message by saying thanks
again for the advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he signs his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got a couple things to say about
this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, that plant that is in the
back that you are unable to check,
[SPEAKER_00]: check that, check it soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant quite possibly has
hermaphroditic tendencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came from a pack that has proven to
have hermaphrodite traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the parts that you can't see are
where you are very likely to get herm
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That section that's not getting enough
light, that part down there on the bottom,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where you're going to get a bunch
of boy flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend you get in there and check
immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's address the actual question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main question was, do I think the
green light leaking from your mini split
[SPEAKER_00]: caused this hermaphrodite issue?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I do not think the green light was the
overall cause of your hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the hermaphrodite is most likely a
genetics issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said the Bodhi seeds do not have any
problems, that that diesel Pakistani is
[SPEAKER_00]: the one that hermed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would assume that that's where the
problem lies is within that diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: Pakistani.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was also a freebie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that may be a small indicator of
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because it was the freebie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now everybody's going to be afraid of the
freebies that I give out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, those are the same things that I
put in packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just generous and I like to give extra
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you get a freebie from me,
it's the same shit that went in the
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just put it in a plastic baggie instead
of putting an insert in there and I save
[SPEAKER_00]: myself a buck and you get free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be afraid of my freebies,
but those random freebies that come from
[SPEAKER_00]: vendors, sometimes those are just random
freebies for a reason because they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it look like you got something,
but they're just giving you a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be a little weary of that sometimes,
unless it's from a reputable breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who these diesel Pakistanis
came from, so I shouldn't even talk like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of times free stuff is
problematic in this industry and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to say that your problem was
probably these diesel Pakistani seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the Bodhi stuff didn't herm,
I'm not going to blame the issue on that
[SPEAKER_00]: green light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until recently, it's been believed that
plants do not absorb the green light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are green, so they should in turn
reflect green light, but there has been
[SPEAKER_00]: some argument recently that the green
light does have some use and it may cause
[SPEAKER_00]: problems, but your green light was very
minimal and I do not think it was the
[SPEAKER_00]: culprit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really going to blame this on
questionable genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have any more of those diesel
Pakistani seeds, I would probably get rid
[SPEAKER_00]: of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would feed those to a bird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would feed them to a squirrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just would not grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I would highly recommend you grow
more of the Bodhi seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have more of those, plant those,
grow those.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you need more seeds, you can get
them through OregonEliteSeeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: They carry Bodhi seeds, they carry Iri
genetic seeds, and they've got seeds from
[SPEAKER_00]: all of your favorite breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I want to thank you again for a great
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was great content, a really great
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a fun one to answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if anybody else out there has an
email they would like answered on the
[SPEAKER_00]: show, my email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, let's jump into
another email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is short.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi Rasta Jeff, I hope you are well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the great work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks for starting out with the
great compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise I will keep up the great work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email goes on to say, seriously,
I do not listen to a lot of podcasts,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I listen to pretty much only your show
religiously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that feels great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for being a dedicated follower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think are the correct words for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the message goes on and it says,
I'm wondering if you have any thoughts on
[SPEAKER_00]: the pros versus cons of decarboxylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside of making cannabinoids active for
edibles, I have read that it also makes
[SPEAKER_00]: the flowers stronger for smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Signed J.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they say PS, long live white
Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey white Mike, you got a shout out on the
show, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so let's talk about
decarboxylation briefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, decarboxylation is not something
I am super educated or informed on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Decarboxylation is more something done in
the edibles game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not an edible maker, so I don't have
too much practice at this, but I do know a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit about cannabis and about our
bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal of decarboxylation, as mentioned
earlier in this email, is to actually make
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabinoids more bioavailable when
consumed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main way decarboxylation happens is
through heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis flowers and or concentrates can
be heated to specific temperatures to
[SPEAKER_00]: activate the cannabinoids for specific
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I am honestly not educated in the
knowledge of decarbing at specific
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures for desired effects,
but I know that that is a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now decarboxylation happens through heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take cannabis flowers or oils and we
heat them to a specific temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: which makes them more bioavailable.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times this would happen in our
liver, inside of our bodies, if we ate raw
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: By heating it up, we are speeding up that
process so that when we eat it,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can get more of the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So decarbing is absolutely useful in an
edible product.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I think happens is when you are
baking the product, I think you are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of the decarbing during that baking
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you want to eat an oil as just an
oil or use it as a mix in with something
[SPEAKER_00]: else, then it is wise to decarb your oil
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're making like a brownie,
or some cookies or something traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, I do not believe in my opinion
that it is necessary to decarb pre-baking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the baking will handle that part
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going to use the oil or butter
to make something else and use the butter
[SPEAKER_00]: or oil as a topping and it's not going to
get recooked, then you may want to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider the decarbing process before
putting the cannabinoids into the fat
[SPEAKER_00]: carrier, which is your oil or your butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when it comes to decarbing before
smoking, that doesn't seem to be necessary
[SPEAKER_00]: to me because what I've mentioned this
whole time is that decarb oxidation
[SPEAKER_00]: happens mainly through heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is not my wheelhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am nowhere near an expert in this realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am talking from my minute amount of
experience in this realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that decarbing happens through heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're smoking, you're putting fire to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you are basically instantly
decarbing it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're activating it through fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think a decarb is going to make
smoked product more potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I am not an expert in this
department.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if somebody would like to email me and
correct me, I love corrections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Corrections are a great opportunity to
learn something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feel free, send me an email,
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an opportunity for you to educate
me and I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main portion of this email was
asking my opinion on the pros versus cons
[SPEAKER_00]: of decarbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely agree with decarbing for
making an edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't find it necessary for smoking
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, this email was wrapped up with
the great slogan that says, take a fat dab
[SPEAKER_00]: and give your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can promise you both of those will
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to thank you once again for
the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also ended that one with P.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long live white Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Mike, you've got another fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World, it is time for
me to start wrapping up this episode.
