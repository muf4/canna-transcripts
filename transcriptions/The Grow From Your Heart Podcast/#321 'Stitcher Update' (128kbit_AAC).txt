[SPEAKER_00]: Hey what's up cannabis community it's
Rasta Jeff and it's time for a really
[SPEAKER_00]: quick episode of the Grow From Your Heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been getting messages from people who
are trying to listen to the podcast on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Stitcher application with an Android
device and there have been a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in contact with Stitcher for a
couple of days and I think I have
[SPEAKER_00]: identified the issue and I think I have
found a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way I can verify that I have
corrected the issue is by putting out an
[SPEAKER_00]: episode and hoping people are able to
listen on their Android devices through
[SPEAKER_00]: the Stitcher application.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been trying to listen to my show
on your Android phone through the Stitcher
[SPEAKER_00]: app and it has been failing I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything should be fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the episodes you were unable to
listen to are on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the episodes are also available on
the Stitcher website.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only issue was with the Stitcher
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were able to download the episodes
and listen to them later but if you were
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to stream it and you were not on a
wifi you were unable to access many of the
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go back and try to
re-download them you can do that but I
[SPEAKER_00]: suggest you check them out on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again I want to apologize to
everybody for not being able to listen to
[SPEAKER_00]: my episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you rely on my teaching and I
know that a lot of people look forward to
[SPEAKER_00]: the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I get some people through their
shitty work week so I apologize for not
[SPEAKER_00]: being there for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for sticking by and if I lost you
for a few episodes welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're listening on iTunes or any
other podcast service or YouTube or
[SPEAKER_00]: through my website hey thanks for sticking
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for joining me for a quick
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright you guys I'm gonna wrap up this
quickie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would appreciate it if you could share
that the podcast has been repaired on
[SPEAKER_00]: Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can tweet the show, if you can post
an Instagram post, anything to help me out
[SPEAKER_00]: and let the audience know that I'm back on
Stitcher I would appreciate that because I
[SPEAKER_00]: can tell by my numbers that I lost quite a
few people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright you guys that's all I've got for
you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back Monday with a fresh new
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all the love and support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next time take a fat dab and give
your mama hug for me.
