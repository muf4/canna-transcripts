[SPEAKER_02]: So keep it locked.
[SPEAKER_02]: The grow from your heart podcast starts
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, now here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 813 of the grow from your
heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang out because in this episode,
we are going to give away free seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: before we talk about the free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to say thank you to all of the
people who have been asking, where is the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been on restriction on YouTube for a
couple of weeks, so I've not been able to
[SPEAKER_00]: post new episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube did not like some of my older
content, so they put me on punishment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on a little timeout, but I am back
and I am excited to be here back with you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to everybody who checked in on
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, big thanks to everybody who has been
asking about I redirect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I redirect is currently under
construction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working on a few things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing some inventory, doing some updates,
working on some stuff behind the scenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: doing some changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have no fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will have updates very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I redirect is down, I do recommend
checking out the other vendors on
[SPEAKER_00]: iriegenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I highly recommend seeds
herenow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I want to send an update to
everybody who contributed $25 on in the
[SPEAKER_00]: month of August on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody who contributed $25 on Patreon
in the month of August was promised a free
[SPEAKER_00]: pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did not get your free pack of
seeds, please do send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I redirect went down right in the middle
of that free seed giveaway, so I
[SPEAKER_00]: understand some people may have been
screwed out of a pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that did happen to you, please send me
a message and I assure you I will get you
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds that you are owed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I do want to continue this party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do another pack of seeds for the
month of September.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody who contributes $25 or more to
Patreon in the month of September will get
[SPEAKER_00]: a free pack of Whitechapel seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, Whitechapel is a golden goat
female pollinated by a Jack the Ripper
[SPEAKER_00]: male.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of crazy turpentine turps,
a lot of lemon, lime, spicy, tropical
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit kind of turps, and an amazing crazy
head buzz and of course, big fat harvests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is Whitechapel that is available to
everybody who contributes $25 or more in
[SPEAKER_00]: the month of September on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a mouthful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I got past most of the
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more important thing to
cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to jump into the email
portion of today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last order of business to cover on
today's podcast before we get to these
[SPEAKER_00]: emails is to let you know that I will not
do an episode next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a small mini vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be out of town for several days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to cram another episode in
before I take off from my little trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to just enjoy my week, enjoy my
time off, not stress over a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you guys will be just fine growing
ganja without me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you missed the podcast that much,
go listen to some of the older episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 800 and something episodes to
listen to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go catch up on some older content,
but for all the people that check on me
[SPEAKER_00]: when I don't put out a show, I'm going to
skip an episode on purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not be here next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go on an adventure on a
little trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm honestly going to go see fish in
Denver for four nights.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite band is fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing four nights in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to check out and go have some
good times, uh, go regroup and refresh a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll be back in a week after that
with the content that you are used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that is all of the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do I want to go now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about some really cool shit
that's been happening in my garden
[SPEAKER_00]: recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I popped a few new seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I moved some plants out time to move some
new shit in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I popped some new seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got some of my own crosses going
and I've got crosses from some other
[SPEAKER_00]: people going, uh, I wanted to run some of
my seeds so that I can open up my breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: projects and add some of my lines to the
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also wanted to introduce brand new
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what would we talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's tell you that I put some double
dragon seeds in my, uh, bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're about this tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, if you're only listening,
I think that's six or eight inches tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they're a little tiny babies,
but they're looking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some double dragon babies in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, what else could I tell you about?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are big mountain fudge cake babies
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, those both came from my lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those are two great strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, then also there is some banana God
version two from my buddy, Masonic smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Mace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also big shout out to my buddy,
Billy bong smoking for giving me the pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, also shout out to my buddy Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a conspiracy involved there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And getting me that pack of banana God,
uh, Terps and Billy bong conspired said
[SPEAKER_00]: that I should breed with the banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: God Terps told Billy to buy me the pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Billy got the pack from Mace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Billy handed me the pack at an event with
a big smile on his face.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew what was supposed to happen
from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have no fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, the banana God has been
germinated and is growing strong and it
[SPEAKER_00]: looks really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be some great winners in that
pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if we'll find a male or a
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully there's a breeding candidate in
there so we can do some breeding with the
[SPEAKER_00]: banana in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in this same run of seeds are some
Jamaican lambs bred F fours that are
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, but they don't look as vigorous
as the rest of the batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to let them go a little longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see if they come around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've recently fed them a little more
heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also increased the DLI in that room,
uh, to get them a little bit more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see if we could turn those plants
up just a little bit, but so far the
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaican lambs bred, uh, there's a kind of
older seeds that were kind of smaller and
[SPEAKER_00]: those seeds aren't looking as good as the
rest of the room, but those are the
[SPEAKER_00]: strains I'm going to tell you about.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that room right now, there's the,
uh, the double dragon, there's big
[SPEAKER_00]: mountain fudge cake, there's banana God,
and there's the Jamaican lambs bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might also be something else secret
in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I don't share everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to have some secrets, but I like to
let you know kind of what's going on in
[SPEAKER_00]: that grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also an update on that grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's something I really wanted to talk
about recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I purchased an iPhone app that is called
photon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me make sure that's really what it's
called because I just wrote down photon
[SPEAKER_00]: off of memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure that I'm giving you
the correct info.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is photon.
[SPEAKER_00]: P H O T O N E.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the photon app in my iPhone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the photon app is basically a par meter
or a D L I meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You download the app.
[SPEAKER_00]: The application is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, then you will need to buy an add-on
for the app, uh, depending on what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: light you have, you have to buy an add-on
for that spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not every spectrum comes for free,
but it's like somewhere between three and
[SPEAKER_00]: five bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember what I paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't hurt at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just paid a couple of bucks to buy a
download to have the appropriate spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: for the lights I'm running in my room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I downloaded the, uh, the appropriate
led spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it teaches you how to make a little
light diffuser for your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically just wrap a piece of paper
around your phone and then you can use
[SPEAKER_00]: your phone as a light meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hold the light right at canopy level
and it will tell you your D L I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can also use, uh, the internet or
books or your common knowledge to dial in
[SPEAKER_00]: your lights to the appropriate D L I.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did notice once I got that D L I dialed
in on my seedlings, they quit stretching.
[SPEAKER_00]: They started bushing out and they look
much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I highly recommend the photon app for
your iPhone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was free other than the download.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like somewhere between four and $5
for the download.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just double tap on the side of your
phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll download it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it installs right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only took a minute or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: The diffuser only took a few seconds to
make the, uh, taping it together was the
[SPEAKER_00]: hardest part because I'm clumsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then you just get in there and
read the settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hold the phone at canopy level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say, oh, it's too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I go up to the led light and I
crank up the knob on the led light until
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets to the reading, which I want it
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: My meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I started off at 13 and over the past
few days, I've slowly adjusted to 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the plants are adjusting very well
with the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, once the plants get a little bit
bigger, I'll turn it to 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they get bigger, I'll go to 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we'll just slowly increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by the end of flower,
I should be somewhere between 45 and 55 D
[SPEAKER_00]: L I is what I expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will hit by the end of flower,
but I really do see an improved
[SPEAKER_00]: performance in my seedlings since I've got
that D L I dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are experiencing things like a
stretchy laggy seeds, or if the seeds are
[SPEAKER_00]: just growing too tall and tipping over,
maybe just maybe probably most likely you
[SPEAKER_00]: need more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way to determine that would be
some sort of a light meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light meters are very expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not cheap at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the photon app is working very well
with my iPhone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, I keep saying it was
about four or $5.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are burning the tops of your
plants, if your plants are looking yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: and crispy, or if they're getting bleached
and turning white up at the top,
[SPEAKER_00]: if the top leaves are getting crispy,
but nothing else is, you may be giving
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants too much light, which doesn't
seem possible because they go outside in
[SPEAKER_00]: the sun, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But our grow lights are indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just a few feet away from the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're really punishing that plant all
day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe just maybe perhaps you were
giving your plant too much light and a
[SPEAKER_00]: light meter would definitely be an easy
way to tell you if those plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting too much light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I recommend when you play
with a light meter, write it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an app in my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just basically the notes app.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've got a, a note in my phone all
about that grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I do in that grow room gets
documented in that note.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that on this day, I fed it this
much food on this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I defoliated on this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I increased the DLI from 13 to 14 on the
next day, increased it from 14 to 17,
[SPEAKER_00]: document all of the things that you do in
that room, especially when you were
[SPEAKER_00]: adjusting the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, if you see him starting to act
weird, you can look back and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: four days ago, I changed this light and
now things are going weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take as many notes as you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've been rambling on for a
few minutes and we have not gotten to
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's favorite portion of the
podcast, which of course is the grow help
[SPEAKER_00]: portion of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where I read your grow questions
and I do my best to give you some useful
[SPEAKER_00]: advice on how to improve your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I did say earlier in the podcast that
I'm going to give away free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give away free seeds and the
way to win free seeds is to send me a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to my website, I read genetics
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a tab that says grow help.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you click on that grow help tab,
you send me a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I read that question here on the
podcast, I will send you a free pack of I
[SPEAKER_00]: read genetics, premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's question came from my friend pig
poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up brother?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope all is well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my buddy pig poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, pig poop's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I re army, a member and I read genetic
supporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hang out on discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take dabs together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we talk about life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pig poop is just one really cool dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to my buddy pig poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Piggy's question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently heard a theory that the sex of
our plants is determined during the
[SPEAKER_00]: germination process and that cooler
temperatures will give out more females.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always believed that the seed sex has
been genetically coded at the time of the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding as the seeds are developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, can we germinate in cooler
temperatures to get more females or even
[SPEAKER_00]: just have our breeding tents cooler to get
more female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard a lot of different opinions on
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've seen people say that,
uh, germinating in lower humidity gives
[SPEAKER_00]: you more males or germinating and lower
humidity will give you more females.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard about higher temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard about lower temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have all kinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have heard all kinds of, uh,
gimmicks and ideas and tricks and bro
[SPEAKER_00]: science behind this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is my two cents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just my understanding based on
my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a different idea,
a different approach, different bro
[SPEAKER_00]: science, different white papers than me,
hook me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am very open to ideas and feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you about it in the comments,
write down below or send me an email at
[SPEAKER_00]: grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here is my two cents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is why I think that I strongly
believe that the pollen determines the sex
[SPEAKER_00]: of the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why do I say that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is my supporting evidence?
[SPEAKER_00]: Every statement should have some support.
[SPEAKER_00]: My supporting statements, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do I believe that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I make feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I make feminized seeds, what am I
making?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the main ingredient?
[SPEAKER_00]: Feminized pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollen I'm starting with is a female
that is the feminized ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes me think that the pollen is
the one deciding the sex of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be before the pollen,
something before the pollen could be
[SPEAKER_00]: determining that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from what I see, what I am making fem
seeds by creating female pollen,
[SPEAKER_00]: by creating pollen from a plant with only
female chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like if I can make female pollen
and put that on a female plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: any female plant I put that on,
I'm going to create female seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my mind, in my theory, that says to
me that the pollen is doing the selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollen contains that female chromosome
or the male chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollen is the one carrying the
deciding factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gender reveal comes with the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, like I said, I don't have any real
science behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My science is that I make fem seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making fem pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not doing anything to the female
plants that receive the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am manipulating the pollen donor to give
me female pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my mind, it's the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have some sort of different,
varying opinion, I am very open to hearing
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to be educated if there's a
different education on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, get at it in the comments or
send me an email
[SPEAKER_00]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let me make another supporting
statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I talked about breeding with fems,
if I breed with another plant that is not
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized, it is spitting out pollen,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that pollen will hit plants and it
will make males and females, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time you get 50-50.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that says that that pollen is making
male and female plants to me and that the
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized pollen is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, that just supports my statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really do believe that the pollen is
the one carrying the chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said a moment ago, the pollen
is the one with the big gender reveal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one that lets you know if
you're a boy or a girl, when it hits that
[SPEAKER_00]: stamen, climbs down into the ovule and it
goes boy or girl, and it starts making
[SPEAKER_00]: that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fills up your bract with the seed and
then you get to grow and find out later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been rambling on long enough
about that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dude, Pig Poop, I really do believe
that it is the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, I'm very open to
arguments, conversation, and education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pig Poop, I do owe you another free pack
of seeds, my dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got your address.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check the mail in just a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of great questions here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from somebody who wants to
be called Giant Grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Giant Grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Giant Grasses, please send me your
shipping address with a real name because
[SPEAKER_00]: you did win a free pack of iReGenetics
premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Yo Rasta Jeff, how would you go
about reversing an outdoor plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Since things become to bloom slower
outdoors, I'm just wondering about the
[SPEAKER_00]: timing of my silver thiosulfate sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants have been stretching outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bud should be showing before too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your help.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're asking about making feminized
seeds in an outdoor garden, in an outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: run.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, how would you go about
reversing an outdoor plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: My quick answer is I wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just simply wouldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reversed plants don't make enough pollen,
in my opinion, to really make it worth
[SPEAKER_00]: reversing an outdoor plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a project I would rather keep
indoors because outdoors a lot of that
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen is just going to blow away in the
wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I need as much of that feminized
reversed pollen as I can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the plants don't make as much as a
regular male plant would make when it
[SPEAKER_00]: dumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're manipulating a plant, depending on
how much you spray it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's plant dependent, but you're not going
to make as much pollen in my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would not do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let me try to help you out and tell
you, if you insist, this is how I would
[SPEAKER_00]: probably work the best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we are applying silver thiosulfate to
a plant for a reversal, we need to start
[SPEAKER_00]: applying that solution about 10 days
before that plant goes into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only way to really determine that
is to grow that plant last year and mark
[SPEAKER_00]: down the date when you started seeing it
show signs of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then about 10 days before that,
then maybe 10 days before that,
[SPEAKER_00]: start spraying that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you're seeing signs of flower,
you're about 10 to 14, maybe 15 days in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tells you two weeks ago I went into
flower, which means 10 days before that is
[SPEAKER_00]: when you need to spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would document what you did last
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you wrote it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: When did the plant go into flower last
year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or write down when you noticed the plant
was showing signs of flower this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in Colorado, it's fairly easy for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the plants will start showing
signs of pre-flower, just going into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower around August 15th, which means
flowering day one is usually August 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some plants, in some cultivars,
it takes till the end of August to show a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of pre-flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But many of them, most of them,
they start August 15th.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can really see that pre-flower coming
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tells me that August 1st was probably
the day they really started to flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means 10 days before that was when I
needed to apply my silver thiosulfate
[SPEAKER_00]: solution for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need to hit it day
negative 10 is what we're going to call
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then day one, and then also three,
six, nine, 12, 15, 18, 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're outdoors, I'd probably go
day 24 also.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the timing of that is going to be
weird because the problem outdoors is
[SPEAKER_00]: because now your male is spitting pollen
around day 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day 32, it would have been nicer to have
the females a little further along into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower to receive more pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to have the ideal amount
of pistols to receive that pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will impregnate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will make seeds, but you could have
made more if the timing was better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I recommend doing this indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, that pollen is going to get
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then second of all, the timing isn't
going to be as good as it could have if
[SPEAKER_00]: you did it indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making reg seeds outdoors isn't as
critical because you dump so much more
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That male plant's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just dumping right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The female plant will every granule of
pollen will make a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to make enough pollen unless
you're reversing multiple plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reverse every for every one male you would
do, do two reversals.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you get enough pollen out there
to make it worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got off on a nice ramble there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't do it outdoors, but if you do
spray it day negative 10, I know if you
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't flower it out last year,
you don't know when that date will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe ask around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe ask local ganja farmers around there
say, hey, when do we go into flower here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Use your best judgment and adjust from
what they, what they say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever day one they say is go that
negative 10 spray then, and then start
[SPEAKER_00]: your routine every third day for about 24
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to have the problem of
the pollen flying away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to have the problem of a
bird is going to land on that plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: shake all of your pollen off too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to pollinate all the girls
too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I would keep the feminized breeding
projects indoors unless you insist on
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a greenhouse environment
where you control the airflow and control
[SPEAKER_00]: things, uh, that may be more ideal,
but what I would almost recommend is
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering the reversal indoors,
collecting the pollen, and then putting it
[SPEAKER_00]: on those plants outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's really what you insist on doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, my friend, giant grasses,
I really do hope I helped you out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a fun question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love talking about reversals and fem
seeds, and please do send me your shipping
[SPEAKER_00]: address because I owe you a free pack of
irie genetics, premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you send me your shipping address,
again, please send me a real address with
[SPEAKER_00]: a real name so that I don't have to send
seeds to somebody like wild bills,
[SPEAKER_00]: ganja farm, or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a real name with a real address.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep it secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ship discreetly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's help each other out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's keep the momentum moving
because I do have another great question
[SPEAKER_00]: here in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend,
Dankasaurus.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Dankasaurus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you call Dankasaurus dog?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dankasaurus Rex, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a general grow question that did
come from the irie genetics website on the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow help tab, which means my buddy
Dankasaurus, you do win a free pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: irie genetics, premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me your address again with the real
name and I'll get you a free pack of seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: in the mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: A S A P. This question goes just like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes, yo, what's up rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Dankasaurus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're well, my bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm a long time podcast listener
and a discord lurker, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen you on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I know your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, first off, I'd like to say thank
you for all of the great genetics you have
[SPEAKER_00]: created and all of the great content,
which you have put out, dude, you are so
[SPEAKER_00]: welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sort of stuff keeps me moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, uh, you truly are a teacher when
it comes to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says now to my question,
I have several keepers from a few
[SPEAKER_00]: different breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have it all bag appeal, smell
potency, and some are just good for their
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal values.
[SPEAKER_00]: That that matters also.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says one of my favorites is your dark
hollow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is such a great strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like that funky, garlicky,
mashed potato, we bar trash can funky sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of turp.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I am not a breeder and not even
really a pollen chucker, but I would like
[SPEAKER_00]: to cross the dark hollow into some of the
other keepers just to see how they will
[SPEAKER_00]: turn out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I inspire people with a good strain,
it inspires them to want to chuck that
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes people are like, how do I pick a
plant to breed with?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how you just fucking know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like this plant right here,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It talks to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says something to you like a crazy
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you know to breed with that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow that intuition.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have always works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I want to, um, I'd really like to
cross the dark hollow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you were to look for a dark hollow
male to breed with, what attributes would
[SPEAKER_00]: you look for?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what to look for in a female,
but judging males is a whole different
[SPEAKER_00]: deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's probably just going to be a
trial and error kind of deal, but I figure
[SPEAKER_00]: the best way to start would be to ask the
man himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, anyway, my man, thanks for your
time and all you do for the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to any advice you may be
able to give thanks in advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: My bro, I've got a lot of male selection
advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I've done a full podcast on
selecting male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a 40 minute episode just on
selecting males.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would give that a quick listen or maybe
a 45 minute listen, unless you can time
[SPEAKER_00]: travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it on two X, make it a 27 minute
listen, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I am rambling, but I would
recommend checking out the male selection
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to shine you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to blow you off,
but that podcast has been done and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: very good with a lot of great info.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's focus here specifically on the
breeding with dark hollow, because that is
[SPEAKER_00]: a great plant to breed with and to work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to pass along a lot of great
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark hollow is a GMO female.
[SPEAKER_00]: GMO is known to get fairly tall,
kind of stretchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of long internode spacing and a lot
of big giant leaves with a lot of dark
[SPEAKER_00]: colors and the aromas and flavors are so
disgustingly delicious on the GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it, but it does get kind of tall
and it's super potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does get kind of tall and it needs a
lot of attention when you grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I cross that one to my Arise,
my King Solomon cut of Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a Golden Goat to Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: My Arise plant, my King Solomon plant is
very well known as a male breeding plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: He adds vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: He adds structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: He adds potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: He adds aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: He adds flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: He adds everything you're missing from any
cross you could ever need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I crossed the GMO to the Arise that
made dark hollow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those phenotypes are going to be
kind of taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to breed with it,
I would find one that is not super tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd find one of the shorter, wider
branching phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can pass on that shorter,
more branchy phenotype, that more branchy
[SPEAKER_00]: trait to the progeny, because that tall
one is going to make even taller plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the first traits I would look
for is a shorter branchier plant with
[SPEAKER_00]: closer internodal spacing compared to the
tall stretchier plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tall stretchy one is going to be way
more GMO dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shorter squatty one is going to be a
Arise GMO cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll have some Golden Goat traits in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will breed very beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also look for the one with the really big
dark colored leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be leaves on some phenotypes
that are as big as my hand that'll turn
[SPEAKER_00]: like plum purple colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use that phenotype for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would also give it a nice stem rub
and look for the one that kind of smells
[SPEAKER_00]: like early in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should smell like baby shit and vomit
and bar trash can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as it gets older, it should turn into
like garlic and fuel, garlic and jet fuel,
[SPEAKER_00]: garlic and gas kind of is the aroma that I
would look for for a potential breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: male from the dark hollow progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, once you've selected that dark hollow
male, what I would recommend is to breed
[SPEAKER_00]: it to multiple females and try to find
female plants that are as far different in
[SPEAKER_00]: traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in structure, aroma, flavor,
leaf size and shape, even color of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breed it to stuff as far away from those
traits as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, when we grow out those seeds,
we can see what they did together and then
[SPEAKER_00]: grow out multiple seeds of each cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you did, what else do you have in
the room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you tell me what other strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you didn't tell me what else you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got dark hollow to ice cream
cake and dark hollow to cherry paloma and
[SPEAKER_00]: dark hollow to big mountain fudge cake,
grow all those out and see what traits
[SPEAKER_00]: from the dark hollow carried into each
cross and see how much ice cream cake you
[SPEAKER_00]: get in this cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: See which dark hollow ice cream cake
traits sort of mixed and then see what
[SPEAKER_00]: else did I say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cherry paloma.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what dark hollow and cherry paloma
did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think somebody may have bred that
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: But see how much of that garlic comes out
and how much of that cherry or how much of
[SPEAKER_00]: that orange turp comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other one that I forgot what
I even fucking said over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what traits and flavors come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can see what the boy is doing to
different crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see if the short structure comes
through on all of these, that means he's
[SPEAKER_00]: passing that if some of them are really
tall and really short, that means that
[SPEAKER_00]: he's not passing a lot of his height trait
to the progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they all smell like mashed potatoes,
he's passing that trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: This way we can learn what traits he gives
to his mix and then we can see if he mixes
[SPEAKER_00]: well with others.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he plays well with others, then we can
continue breeding with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we kind of see what it does,
it's like finding out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like tasting the first batch of the
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like tasting the first half of the
batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it taste like chocolate, vanilla,
cinnamon?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it tastes like chocolate, don't breed
it to more chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breed it to vanilla.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it tastes like vanilla, breed it to
cinnamon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out what you're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then learn where to go from there with
your breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, I got super rambling on this
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I helped you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would look for the short one with the
tighter node spacing, the giant dark
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves, the colorful leaves, the bar trash
can smell, that puke acrid gross kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma, one that dumps a lot of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it makes trichomes, that is the one
to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my dude Dankosaurus,
I do want to thank you once again for the
[SPEAKER_00]: great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also make sure you send me your shipping
address so I can get you a free pack of

[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be the guy that emails me on Tuesday
and says, hey, bro, I saw you at the fish
[SPEAKER_00]: shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not come say hi, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come share.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come shake my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I've got seed packs in my
pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might not be able to get the Mylar packs
into the concert, but on the parking lot
[SPEAKER_00]: outside, wherever there's a good chance
I've got seeds in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
