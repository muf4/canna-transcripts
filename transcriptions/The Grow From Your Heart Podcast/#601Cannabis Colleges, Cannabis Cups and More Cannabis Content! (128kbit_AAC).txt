[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's podcast does come from a Patreon
contributor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did send me a very nice set of
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with no further ado, let's just jump
right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend Mr. and it
says,
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for joining us, Mr. This is a
great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on, it says, I continue my life
journey now having over 18 months without
[SPEAKER_00]: any form of pain pills.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like with cannabis,
we have eliminated pain pills from Mr's
[SPEAKER_00]: life and it has been over 18 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a huge improvement in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before, if you need anything,
just let us know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do our best to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it says, my questions this month are
vast and various.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's turn down some of this music and get
right to Mr's questions because he does
[SPEAKER_00]: have a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could take a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says,
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of online cannabis
education programs available during COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure all of them are online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before COVID, you could go to Cloverleaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could go to Oakster Dam.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple other accredited
cannabis universities, which you could
[SPEAKER_00]: attend and get a cannabis education.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a general cannabis education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they do have more focused classes
where you can learn about bud tending,
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivating the backend of the business,
the tax end of the business, the legal
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects of the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will teach you so many things in
these college classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am all about continuing education.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here to educate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here to teach people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all about further education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Furthering your education, broadening your
horizons, setting yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Education is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, sometimes those places will teach
you bad habits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go to those classes with an open mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand that the things they're not
teaching you are not the only way to do
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a problem I see a lot of
cultivators have that come from those
[SPEAKER_00]: types of facilities or come from even
college courses or another facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were taught that this is how I cut
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the only way we can cut clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you come to work for me,
you're going to cut clones the way I teach
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way they taught you in Amsterdam
may be way different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to hear you arguing with
me that, well, in Amsterdam we did or at
[SPEAKER_00]: Oakster Dam we did it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to fire you because I don't
care.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do it this way at micro and it works
this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll listen to you once.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it this way at Oakster Dam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard you now quit trying to change
our ways and let's do it the way we've
[SPEAKER_00]: written SOPs for and the way we've got it
dialed in here in this cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do like the schooling, but keep an
open mind that it is not the only way to
[SPEAKER_00]: do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they teach you there is a way to do
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get a very vast and deep
understanding of the plants, of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: functions, of ways to take care of the
plants, the processes of the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental tips and all kinds of things
that I probably don't even know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, I like to be able to
train somebody that comes into a facility
[SPEAKER_00]: to work in my facility the way I need it
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of plant knowledge is cool,
but if you go to one of those universities
[SPEAKER_00]: and learn too much, you know just enough
to fuck something up in my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do go to that, remember that
you're not getting the total 100% only way
[SPEAKER_00]: answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting a very good education,
but you've got to keep yourself open
[SPEAKER_00]: minded that there are other things to
learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do go to something like that,
I recommend focusing on something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find your niche in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody starts off, they want to become
a good grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They understand the plants, then they
understand the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we all kind of branch off into our
own direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I obviously became a breeder and a
podcaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some other people are really good in the
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people also became HVAC technicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people also became electricians.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people also become carpenters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are really good at cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are all about phenohunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find your niche in the cannabis industry
and if you can focus your classes on that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that will definitely help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe learn about pesticides and pesticide
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn everything you can about pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be the pest guy, the guy that eradicates
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said a moment ago, maybe learn about
HVAC or electricity or even be a plumber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you need to learn about the tax laws
and the backend of the business,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the technical stuff, all the
accounting and the bookkeeping and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you need to learn all the logistics
of that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're a salesman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're in sales in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you do, find your niche and try
to find the cannabis schooling that will
[SPEAKER_00]: dial in your niche and give you a solid
foundation and somewhere to shine if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you're trying to get into
the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to do to shine in the
industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have something you can bring to the
industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you a salesperson?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you a craftsperson?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you a plumber, an electrician,
an HVAC tech or do you simply want to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Find what you want to do and get those
classes and specialize in that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when you go to work for somebody,
don't be so stubborn that we have to fire
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had amazing cultivators work in
cultivation facilities with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked with some amazing cultivators
and I've had to fire them because I catch
[SPEAKER_00]: them doing it their way and not our way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your way works in your garden,
but I've got a strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the map with the key and the
legend and the starting point and the
[SPEAKER_00]: ending point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got that on paper and if we don't
follow my map, we're not all going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: to the same goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're doing your weird shit in my
garden, I come in, I'm like, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: why did this happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, oh, I decided I would top the
plants and do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't going to top those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you just fucked up the whole garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that you've got to go adapt
to somebody else's grow once you're hired.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will give you a solid foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to run your own stuff,
this is a good way to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get a full education that way,
but keep in mind there's always more to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you think you've learned it all,
that's when you fuck yourself from
[SPEAKER_00]: learning anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you asked my thoughts about these non
novice cultivator or someone wanting to
[SPEAKER_00]: get into the industry and looking at any
cannabis college.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I covered that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it, educate yourself, but keep in mind
you did not learn everything and you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got to be open to the teachings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give you the training I'm
going to give you when you work with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is another question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I am a cannabis cup virgin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any word about the status of cannabis cups
in 2021?
[SPEAKER_00]: This question brings up a thought on
judging these events.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the criteria used to judge the
cannabis entries at these events?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a couple of thoughts on possible ways
to prevent someone buying or swaying votes
[SPEAKER_00]: is using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, another way of swaying that is by
using a double blind panel approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's my favorite, a veterans only
panel, a veterans only panel would be
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got like the veterans choice or
something at one of those events,
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be a cool new category to add
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only people able to vote in that
were the veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be fucking pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that category.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I ever do throw a cup or I'm involved
in a cup, I will mention a veterans only
[SPEAKER_00]: category veterans choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, veterans choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get to try all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The veterans get to try outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't mean to include myself in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The veterans get to try all of the samples
that were donated and the veterans get to
[SPEAKER_00]: say sample 42 was the winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that veterans choice award.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let me focus on the question because I
am a little bit rambly today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, um, any word on the status of
cannabis cups in 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, no word, no updates on any,
any events like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody is waiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are waiting for a vaccine
and word from our fucking government.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't even know what we're allowed to
do, what we can do at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't see any cannabis events in 2021
coming up, especially consumption events.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it will be a very, very long time
before we are smoking anything together in
[SPEAKER_00]: a room together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I am on the fence about how I feel
about the future of events with COVID and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of me wants to get out there and see
all of my friends and, uh, smoke and high
[SPEAKER_00]: five everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a business person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to take my booth to the businesses
where business happens and meet all of my
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my favorite part of the events.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to meet all of you that have been
listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You come up and you're like Ross,
Jeff, I've been listening to the show and
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that recharges me for the next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to have all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I don't know that I want to get some
weird fucking disease and get sick and get
[SPEAKER_00]: other people sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I'm going to get away from that
political talk because we hear enough
[SPEAKER_00]: about that shit, but I don't think there
are going to be any events in 2021 that I
[SPEAKER_00]: am aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did see a couple of things in a couple
of places, but I will not be attending
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were very small events compared
to like cannabis cups and things,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there are very tiny smoke gatherings
happening, but I'll be avoiding those for
[SPEAKER_00]: the time being, um, judging these events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I do have some notes on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me jump into my notes judging,
uh, it's been long rumored that many of
[SPEAKER_00]: the larger cups are for sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be quite honest with you, you do hear
any event you go to anything where there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a prize.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always hear that the cups,
the prizes and the awards are for sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did say rumored it is a rumor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hearsay allegedly that some of those
cups are for sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that being said, I know people
personally who have sat not at this table,
[SPEAKER_00]: but at the table that used to be in this
spot that have sat here who have won
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cups from high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And have won other, uh, first place awards
from other prestigious, uh, cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate events and competitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that those people that won
simply don't have the money to buy an
[SPEAKER_00]: award.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like those people won those
awards fair and square.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know their business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm friends with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what allegedly it would cost to win
a cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know they don't have that kind of
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that my friends won those
categories fair and square.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won those events, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes some of the bigger ones,
it is questionable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to point any fingers or
anything, but it has definitely been
[SPEAKER_00]: questionable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you see the guys with the larger
booths, uh, the largest presence they win.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems like they just threw a bunch
of money at the event and the event went,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, yeah, you gave us enough money to
host this whole event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just going to give you the
awards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that's what it feels like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allegedly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no evidence toward that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk myself out of that hole
really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, um, ideally judging is based on
categories and subcategories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to have, uh, obviously a
flower category, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's buds, flowers, buds,
dried buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, people are going to have a flower
category in that category.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to find indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to find a sativa and you're
going to find a hybrid category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to judge those
categories on basically looks,
[SPEAKER_00]: smell, flavor, aromas, the buzz you get
from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you smoke it, how the, how does it
burn?
[SPEAKER_00]: How was the burn ability?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the ash come out chunky and black?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the ash come out nice and white?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it burn your throat when you smoke it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it make you cough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it give you weird cotton mouth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it have a weird flavor to it?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that is going to matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also we're going to give it,
give it to a lab and let the lab test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree and disagree with labs testing our
cannabis for competitions because I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: grow my flower for a machine to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really care what the gas
chromatography or liquid chromatography
[SPEAKER_00]: machine says.
[SPEAKER_00]: I care what you say when you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen a computer take a rip off
a joint and go, damn, that was good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or nah, that's not as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've seen some of my friends hit a
joint and go, that's not bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen them hit another joint and
go, damn, that's the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the ones we're trying to
impress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not worried too much about the
machines, but they do send samples to the
[SPEAKER_00]: lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do terpene analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do THC and CBD analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also check for pesticides and heavy
metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they announce all of that along
with the winners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes they will do a highest terpene
winner, which is done with the labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll do a highest THC winner,
which is done with the lab tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another criteria for testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it starts off with the flower category,
then it breaks down into subcategories.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got your indica, your sativa,
your hybrid, and then we judge those based
[SPEAKER_00]: on the criteria that I spoke of.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some events, they will do an indoor
category, an outdoor category,
[SPEAKER_00]: a greenhouse category, and a fully organic
category as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what's to stop people from
saying that their indoor was grown
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their outdoor was grown indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully everyone's just honest with
that, but those are other opportunities
[SPEAKER_00]: and other categories that are available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you see at the events a lot
is concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We judge concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a concentrate competition,
usually best concentrate, highest CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a lot of these also, there is a
crowd's choice or a crowd favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give that award out as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they do the concentrates,
we basically judge it off of what it looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like, what it smells like, what it tastes
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the buzz is very important because
you're smoking 40 samples in a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did two of them stick out to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did one get you super buzzed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Buzz compared to the others?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then how does it react when you put it on
the banger, on the nail, however you
[SPEAKER_00]: consume it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it sparkle up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it splatter up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it make a bunch of weird noises?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it sizzle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it leave any char or residue on the
banger?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a good, clean looking concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what it's supposed to look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: A nice color, a nice texture, a good
aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it to burn nicely on the rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want it to leave any residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want it to taste funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want it to leave any weird
aftertaste.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it to have good, pleasant,
only cannabis-derived terpenes that leave
[SPEAKER_00]: good flavors in my mouth is all I want to
taste at the end of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want any weird additives or weird
flavor enhancers or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want it to leave weird shit on my
banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want my rig to be clean and ready for
another dab after that dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a winning concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I hit it and I go, damn, that tastes
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm high as fuck and my rig isn't all
dirty from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good concentrate right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're looking for when it
comes to judging concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will find several categories of
concentrates based on your location,
[SPEAKER_00]: the region of the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some newer places, you're going to get
solvent and non-solvent concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you're going to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solvent is anything like BHO or hexane or
propane-derived concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all solvent-derived concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they say non-solvent, that does
include water hash and SIFT and any type
[SPEAKER_00]: of bubble hash and maybe even pressed hash
at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let me give a disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did just say that non-solvent hash is
water hash and people are going to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: but Rostichev, water is a solvent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend Nicka T taught us that in the
process of making bubble hash,
[SPEAKER_00]: water is not used as a solvent because it
is not dissolving the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is used as an agitator, a separating
agent, and it is washing the trichomes
[SPEAKER_00]: from the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, I do understand the science that
water is a solvent.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, the product we are using is
not water soluble, so it is not being a
[SPEAKER_00]: solvent-type product in this hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is washing, it is being used as an
agitator, as a separating agent,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit different than a solvent
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does count as a non-solvent product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Nicka T for teaching us the
difference between solvent and non-solvent
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates and why water is not a
solvent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in that category, you may see
diamonds, you may see sauce, you may see a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of other different types of
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said based on your location and your
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in Colorado, we've had legalization
for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: The race is on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all been trying to find the best
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's trying to make the best
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you're going to see different
categories because it's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe in a newer market, all the
concentrates haven't evolved because
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization hasn't been there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The technology hasn't been there.
[SPEAKER_00]: People haven't been striving and learning
as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may just find smaller options.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get your solvent and non-solvent
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you may see carts, cartridges,
cartridges filled with concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find your best cart, your highest
turp cart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And highest THC and CBD carts will be
available at a lot of the competitions now
[SPEAKER_00]: because cartridges are becoming very
popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think cartridges are about 50 to 70% of
sales here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a lot of carts out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carts are getting real popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you will see edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will have the best edible and highest
CBD edible at the cannabis cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another competition that they will
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, they will have best overall CBD
product is something you'll also see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are a lot of the categories that
you see at a cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make sure I covered your
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the criteria?
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoke it, we look at it, we make sure
it's enjoyable basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ways to prevent someone buying or swaying
votes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I don't know that that does
not happen and I don't know how to stop
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way to do it is to make
everything based on public votes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've seen what happens with voting
and welcome to 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to move forward from that
statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: The veterans panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a fucking cool idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before, I agree with the
veterans panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put you on the veterans panel and
I would make sure that we had plenty of
[SPEAKER_00]: good concentrates for the veterans and
then you guys would leave with all the
[SPEAKER_00]: leftovers at all these competitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually the people that throw it leave
with the leftovers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll send it home with the veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that is part two of a long
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into part three and see how far
we get through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have to save a couple for another
episode because this is getting quite
[SPEAKER_00]: long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number three on Mr's question says,
your thoughts about COVID's impact on the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry and the future of
cannabis cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you noticing any pandemic proof
aspects in the industry, in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: business or community?
[SPEAKER_00]: So my thoughts on COVID's impact on the
cannabis industry and the future of cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: The impact on the industry, we have been
selling record numbers of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: People when they were stuck at home during
quarantine, when they couldn't go out and
[SPEAKER_00]: do things, people were smoking tremendous
amounts of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the industry, we saw a lot of
cannabis sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the future of cannabis cups,
I said before, I don't know how long until
[SPEAKER_00]: people are going to be comfortable,
especially myself going out and smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: and doing stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to get out there, but I've got
mixed emotions.
[SPEAKER_00]: An event would draw a large crowd and
large crowds are kind of what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: against.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't be there for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also at the start of the pandemic,
a lot of people started growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people started buying seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say that anything is
recession proof, but it feels like when
[SPEAKER_00]: things go, things go weird, people turn to
things that make them feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis is one of the things that
makes people feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, people had to think about their
budgets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't buy as much cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to smoke more.
[SPEAKER_00]: They turned to growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did see an influx of new growers and
seed buyers at the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't say anything's recession proof,
but the seed business did not slow down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are still adjusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing is stable at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to say that the industry
is recession proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say that the seed business
will keep going, but as the adjustment has
[SPEAKER_00]: happened, things have been well for my end
of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what works this month may not work
next month.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, one day we're able to go eat at
restaurants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next day we're not allowed to eat at
restaurants.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day we're allowed to shop in the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next day we had to do it outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the whole idea of job security
disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of rambling on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, podcasting seems to be pandemic proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: You asked if there's anything,
uh, pandemic proof in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I can think of that has
been pandemic proof is podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not missed a single episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have stepped up the quality of my show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've stepped up the, uh, everything,
the gear, the technology, the show is way
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying to put more time,
energy, and effort into the show since we
[SPEAKER_00]: can't go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the podcast has basically been
pandemic proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as I don't get sick, as long as I
don't get sick, as long as I don't get the
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID, the show must go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll still come record with COVID because
I can cough right into the damn microphone
[SPEAKER_00]: and the camera and you guys will be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, knock on wood a lot to make sure I
don't get the, the vid, but I've also been
[SPEAKER_00]: protecting myself, making sure I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, I think that the pandemic,
uh, the only thing is Pandy proof here is
[SPEAKER_00]: podcasting and I don't want to jinx
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's move forward from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see question number four,
explain how you personally develop a sense
[SPEAKER_00]: and taste profile for your strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I says, for example, my strain smells like
wet diapers, dirty feet stored next to
[SPEAKER_00]: mothballs and an old gasoline canister.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, that sounds like something I would
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do I explain my flavors and aromas?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, basically I have got a very strong,
uh, aroma memory bank, I guess is the way
[SPEAKER_00]: to put that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I associate aromas and flavors and
foods with places and times and locations
[SPEAKER_00]: and people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our aroma, our sense of smell is very,
uh, very strong and it has a very long
[SPEAKER_00]: memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't forget smells and aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can forget names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can forget faces.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can forget directions to places.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can forget what I'm saying in the middle
of a sentence, but if I smell something
[SPEAKER_00]: like, Oh, that's.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that perfume that grandma used to
wear called this from this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she wore it at that one event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll never forget the smell grandma
and that event just because of aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that was a really weird example to
pick, but try to pick something random.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smells will trigger memories for me and
they don't go away and they're really
[SPEAKER_00]: vivid in my nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I almost sounds, I may sound like I
need mental help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost smell in colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why the red pill and blue pill got
called red pill and blue pill.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why a lot of my strain names have
colors in the names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's why they're related to fruits
that have a color that you'll recognize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smell in color as weird as that may
sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it sounds weird as I say it,
but I smell in color.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smell visually.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I smell like this weird dank musty
smell, I can see the basement where I used
[SPEAKER_00]: to learn the drums, like weird shit like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can just, I can my, so what I'm doing
when I'm telling you that this smells or
[SPEAKER_00]: this, uh, this product tastes or smells
like, uh, dirty feet stored next to
[SPEAKER_00]: mothballs in an old gasoline container.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm basically doing is I'm smoking it
and I'm going, huh, there's this flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's mothballs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mothballs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I exhale.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it left gas and like drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dryness on my tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it tastes like mothballs and chalky
gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just what my brain associated those
flavors with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I'm trying to find familiar words
for you, things that you have eaten,
[SPEAKER_00]: smelled, smoked, drank, tasted,
that I can relate that flavor to you so
[SPEAKER_00]: that when you smoke it, you can go,
holy shit, that does taste like oranges
[SPEAKER_00]: and dirty feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that you're familiar with,
something that my brain is familiar with,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just try to articulate that from,
uh, just from my mental memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a, a Rolodex of flavors and
aromas in my nose that I will never
[SPEAKER_00]: forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I smell them, I can recall them
quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably blindfold me and take
me to a few places I've been quite often
[SPEAKER_00]: and just let me go in there and smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could probably tell you where I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of commercial grows in
Colorado that when I walk into them,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can smell that grow very specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds crazy, but I know the
smell of, I'm not even going to say the
[SPEAKER_00]: names of the few of the cultivation
facilities, but they've all got a very
[SPEAKER_00]: distinct smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I walked in, you blindfolded me,
I could say, oh, we're over here at this
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can say, oh, we're over here at this
place by the smell of the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's bionic, uh, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a blessing as a seed breeder
to be able to identify flavors and aromas
[SPEAKER_00]: in that manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm going to keep moving
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two more questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to fit them both in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, uh, number five, is there
anything to harvesting by the full moon
[SPEAKER_00]: lunar cycle or is this faux gross science?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two major solar events in 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you observed these types of celestial
events having any beneficial effects on a
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, my first response to this was no,
because I'm not a hippie, but honestly,
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow indoors on an indoor commercial
production cultivation schedule,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I don't even know if it's sunshine or
rainy or snowy or daylight or nighttime or
[SPEAKER_00]: an eclipse or a riot or a fire outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm working in the cultivation
facility, it is the lights come on at this
[SPEAKER_00]: time, the lights go off at this time,
the plants are on this schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what's going on with the sun
and the moon and the hippie lunar
[SPEAKER_00]: calendar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any clue what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't pay any attention to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had an outdoor grow, I would probably
adjust and learn that hippie science
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do all of that if I had an outdoor
girl, but being an indoor farmer,
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not pay any, any attention to any of
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you've got hate mail for that or
any questions or updates for that,
[SPEAKER_00]: my email address is grow from your heart
at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to hear from anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's got input on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, being an indoor cultivator,
running on a commercial cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule, the sun, the moon, lunar cycles,
eclipses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't make any difference in my
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to go watch the eclipses myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the grow, I don't think the grow cares
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last part, number six.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, uh, you mentioned someone's
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody dropped off some presents early
for my divas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using two of these items already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an handheld infrared thermometer
and a desktop monthly planner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That monthly planner will be invaluable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the best things you can have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, um, my question is about the
infrared thermometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thermometer has a laser used for
pinpoint accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I'm wondering if said laser can
damage the leaves, even if the grow lights
[SPEAKER_00]: are on.
[SPEAKER_00]: After all, we're not supposed to look into
that same laser.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you implement an infrared thermometer?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, where on the plant do you take your
readings?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not think that the infrared dot on
that thermometer is going to disrupt your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, as long as you don't hit it in the
plant's eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know where the plant's eyes
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they have rods and cones to
worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they've got, uh, we're not even
going to go into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell that shit's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to go down a long rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to skip that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you can put that red dot on the leaves
and I think it will tell you the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: surface temperature of those leaves
without doing any damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do I go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I take those readings?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't play with the infrared thermometer
quite often.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't find it to be completely
necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I would hit about the top of the
canopy where the lights are shining and
[SPEAKER_00]: then about a third of the way down and
then toward the bottom, just to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice comparison, what's happening at
different points of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you will notice that the leaf surface
temperature will be vastly different than
[SPEAKER_00]: the air temperature of the room,
especially when using LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go too far into that
because I do have somebody that I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: get on the show to teach us about that a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're using LEDs, the leaf
surface temperature will be drastically
[SPEAKER_00]: different when you're using a metal
highlight or a HPS lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is something to think about,
but I check in about three different spots
[SPEAKER_00]: up at the top where the light's really
intense down in the middle where the
[SPEAKER_00]: light's not so intense and then down lower
where we're not getting much light,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right at the top of where we defoliated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I would check also and see,
make a note of it, write down what the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature is on your leaf surface
temperature and see if things go wrong or
[SPEAKER_00]: if things go right.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if that leaf surface temperature had
anything to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, mister, this was a long and
great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took up the whole episode with this
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great contribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of all, thank you for your
service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've said before, if we can do
anything for you, the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_00]: crew, the IRE Army crew, we have all got
your back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just reach out, let us know what we can do
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already proven that we're here to
help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, what else do we have?
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, thank you for all your time,
effort and all that you do for our
[SPEAKER_00]: community, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a safe and IRE December, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already writing down my questions for
my January letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna have to break that one up into
a couple of episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, lastly, a hand salute to all of
my fellow veteran growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, big shout out to all of the veteran
growers out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, regardless, if you're a
novice, a noob, or if you're a novice or a
[SPEAKER_00]: noob, you are still a veteran grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like mister's sending a lot of love
in this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, peace, love, and a truly
happy new year to all.
[SPEAKER_00]: My growers love, hugs, and respect from
mister.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, mister.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to January's message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I may break that one down
into a couple of episodes because this one
[SPEAKER_00]: did get quite long and you stole the show
