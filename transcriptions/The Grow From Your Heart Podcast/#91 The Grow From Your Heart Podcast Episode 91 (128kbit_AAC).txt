[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode number 91 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a news
[SPEAKER_01]: smoker or a hardcore dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_01]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this my friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to send a huge thank you shout out
to the Mystic Roots band for letting me
[SPEAKER_01]: play their music.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of my podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks to Kat, Coot and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I don't have any commercials for
this week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get right into the episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get started, I want to let you
know that this is a part two episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few days ago, Jesse was here and we
recorded for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put up the first half of the
conversation on Monday.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is part two.
[SPEAKER_01]: It starts off with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I asked Jesse if he had any guidance or
advice to give growers, and then we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: just jump into right where he started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get there, I do want to make an
apology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I posted episode 92 iTunes and my website
and Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for some reason, episode 90 did not
make it to Stitcher like it normally would
[SPEAKER_01]: have.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was not my issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Stitcher's issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have since been emailed.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as Stitcher gets episode 90 up,
I will post episode 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to cause any confusion with
Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've emailed them and let them know that
my latest episode did not post.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't want to add another episode
onto that and confuse them.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as Stitcher gets episode 90 out,
episode 91 will be posted right after
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you guys for being patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do apologize for any inconvenience that
may have caused.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I've been rambling enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost a two minute intro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get right down to the part where
Jesse and I are talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I asked Jesse, I basically said,
do you have any guidance that you would
[SPEAKER_01]: like to share with our listeners?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then here is what Jesse had to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't sell junk clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't sell junk clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't sell untested seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't sell clones of plants from seed
that you haven't even flowered yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard so many horror stories at the
grow store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I feel so bad for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't help them, but it just,
it really sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do that stuff, do it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get a bag seed out of, what's this
hash?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Stardog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm taking a dab of Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, what was I even going to say now?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a bag seed of it and you grow
it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, if you grow some weed and it's got a
bunch of seeds in it, that Stardog plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: just because it's wholly seeded to fuck,
doesn't mean you can call those seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: Stardog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are not Stardog seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are unknown seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you hit that Stardog girl with male
Stardog pollen or manipulated the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: and some other fashion to create S1 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still not exactly it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you, my thing is if you don't know
what did it, don't call it Stardog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it could be, there could have been
some pollen in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could have been another one of the
plants that hermed on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could have been a male in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If all you had was seven Stardog plants in
there, I guess you do have Stardog seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you light stressed it and it produced a
bunch of seeds, you do now have Stardog
[SPEAKER_01]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have been a really special
recessive clone phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: What comes out is the dominant piece of
junk.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see grandpa when you grow
from seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see what the grandpa was.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see what grandma was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes those plants were shitty or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of what we have now, the plants that
we're growing now are like your dad's
[SPEAKER_01]: fault.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse's dad is an old time grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the ones who chose these,
some of the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: He actually did some breeding back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had to steal street lights and they
had to use shitty soil and they had to
[SPEAKER_01]: hide.
[SPEAKER_01]: They couldn't run too much electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't know what the hell they were
looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had the shittiest books.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything in the books back then was hand
drawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were still, they were still in
electricity back then.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hand drawn books that you had to go to
shady ass head shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Mel Frank.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take this dad here and then
we'll start doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, those, that generation is
responsible for the plants that we have
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys, some of the guys that went to
war in other countries, brought back seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: from those regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grew those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They found that some were too damn tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: They found that some took way too long and
they got rid of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I bet you bro, I bet there,
now that we've got room and space and
[SPEAKER_01]: lights and technology, I bet some of the
gold was thrown the fuck away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I guarantee.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a bag of old school seeds,
if you're like 50 or 60 years old and
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got a big sandwich bag full of
seeds that you had when you were,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's see, I want to go back to the
seventies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got some 35 year old seeds,
40 year old seeds and you want to share
[SPEAKER_01]: them, send Jesse and I a sandwich baggy
fool and we will throw the shit out of
[SPEAKER_01]: them and we'll take pictures and we'll
give you a clone of our favorite shit out
[SPEAKER_01]: of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some pretty old seeds the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Mr. G and I can't remember
his llama box, llama box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thanks for the hookup guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard of llama box is very familiar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I know llama box?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He won a, yeah, he was one of the winners
for the 50 show.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his little Twitter icon is a little
llama getting crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew I remember that I was taking a dab
and that still made sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to green and healthy wellness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, while I'm thinking about it,
you guys, I wrote down to say this,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was supposed to say it in the intro,
but I just took a dab and I want to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure I don't forget green and healthy
wellness is not closed forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I know I hyped this shop in Colorado
spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to damsel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Haley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Jordan, Jordan's and John
Randall's Jr. But, uh, they had to shut
[SPEAKER_01]: their doors for a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: The building, I don't know how much of
this business is mine to air.
[SPEAKER_01]: The building in which they were located
was sold and the new owner did not want
[SPEAKER_01]: her to move.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were forced to move.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do have a new location.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time you hear this, it is likely
that they are open to back for business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they are not, trust me,
you guys, green and healthy wellness,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude, I saw them working to tear down the
building and it was like army ants and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're just going buck wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody was sweaty and had this
stressful look.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're getting the grow too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They moved everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's always fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are eager to get the new facility
open.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not gone forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, the turp ex hookup at green and
healthy wellness will be back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Denzel will be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I understand it right, they actually
got a better building.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got a better location.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: That building was a little tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: The parking would get a little cramped in
there sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they will be back and it will be better
than ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do apologize for the inconvenience.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that a lot of people rely on them
for their medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they are a medical only shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of patients are looking for a new
spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: For medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I promise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly promise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hunt was here the other day at the house
and hung out and we did make promises to
[SPEAKER_01]: record together very soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That episode will feature the lovely dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's damsel.
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite suicide girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that'll be nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a little famous on the interweb.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, she is a little popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: She gave me a shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sent her up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took, uh, I'm sure I've talked about it
on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm growing a strain called damsel's day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hunting from seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm running three different seed lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, of stuff that I've crossed and I'm
looking to find her favorite phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to name that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damsel's dank.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be marketed at the
dispensary that I represent and the
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary that she represents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I took a picture of the ceiling and
sent it to her.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said the beginning and she put that
on Instagram and within an hour I had a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred new followers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's damsel.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my favorite suicide girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that's hard to pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that'll be, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet that'll be a little bit popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll get some stuff going for both of
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll probably expose both brands
genetics, the suicide girls, dude,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's damsel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, hunt will be part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Grammy Gatsby will be part of
advertising green and healthy wellness
[SPEAKER_01]: will be carrying the flowers for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, in the near future, the spot will have
the flowers, but you guys, this is a year
[SPEAKER_01]: long project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't think this something, this is
something that's going to happen in a few
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we bred a strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We bred a seed line.
[SPEAKER_01]: We bred three seed lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we took those seed lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: They germinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are now.
[SPEAKER_01]: In veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just got put into three gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I've got to run, um, I think 22 of
them out of the original, I think 30
[SPEAKER_01]: started 22 of them have made it to where I
think they'll make it to the flower room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may take one or two out.
[SPEAKER_01]: One's too tall and lanky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's a boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell just by looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so I kind of want to just pull that
one, but then they'll flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they're flowered, there's a private
party set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the date's already been chosen.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a location being put together and
the Grammy Gatsby is going to throw a
[SPEAKER_01]: tasting party and there will be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scorecards and video done and full on
reviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we're taking this one quite
seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this just a Fino hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if he was actually taken the seeds
to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a two year project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I would want to run at least a
hundred of those seeds myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: After I ran 20 or 50 of them myself,
I would start sending 10 packs out to
[SPEAKER_01]: friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd give you 10 of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow these now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't fuck around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow these now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send them out to friends that are eager to
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would grow them right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would send me pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would send me feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're local, I get to go,
I get to go to roster Ralph's garden and
[SPEAKER_01]: look at my blue healer growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to go to people's places and see my
plants growing in their gardens and get
[SPEAKER_01]: feedback, which improves my breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because then I could say, Oh God,
I never want to breed with that fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: plant ever again.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the blue healer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue healer is the blue dream and the
grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Spencer for the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I'm going to cross the blue
dream and the grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes, that's a blue healer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just spit it out like it was nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the name it got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got packs of seeds for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, uh, I don't think I've ever grown a
blue dream cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not my favorite strain in the world
to be honest, but that was kind of my
[SPEAKER_01]: goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Colorado was in love with blue dream
and the girls in California are in love
[SPEAKER_01]: with blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cash crop plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have some additional value,
but it, it's used too much here as a cash
[SPEAKER_01]: crop plant for what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's, uh, and I forgot the cross of it
suddenly that it's blueberry and silver
[SPEAKER_01]: haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's by DJ shorts son or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: JD short or his son in law.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I'm not sure if that's
actually true because I, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's up for debate guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know the truth of where the blue
dream came from a couple of stories,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's a haze and it's a blue dream and
it's got some OG, I think in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you would think from what I've read,
I remember thinking that would be the
[SPEAKER_01]: ideal strain, but then I remember getting
my hands on a couple of different grows of
[SPEAKER_01]: it and smoking it and being like,
this is mediocre, but there's an amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking phenotype of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Andy's blue dream phenotype is the most
impressive I've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's, it's just a phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, it's labeled ABD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to think that's just the blue
dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all over Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one I'm pretty sure it's the
one I bred too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but the blue dream kicks out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pull two pounds under a thousand
watt light and soil with that blue dream
[SPEAKER_01]: cut easily with a short, short veg time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a one with a real short veg time
last year outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did like three and a half pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem is it doesn't have an
appealing high to me and it doesn't make
[SPEAKER_01]: enough hash to make it worth its time,
space, energy, nutrients, whatever else.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I could replace that with a bounty killer
and have way better medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it smelled like it, or if it tasted
like it smelled, it'd be the most popular
[SPEAKER_00]: strain in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, my goal when I hit it with the
grateful dog was to put that resin on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was, and it worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made it, uh, shortened the flowering
time that made the plants a little
[SPEAKER_01]: stockier and it put some resin and a
little bit of funk to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, which was what all that's all that
blue dream was missing was resin and funk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was getting too tall for a lot of
indoor grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I bet the DJ short came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, anything with his stuff's always
seems to be really dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a lot, you know, that says a lot for
his breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because he's taken it to the F five
before he releases his packages,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has a style of his own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've heard him argue with many people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, on podcasts and interviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a couple of minutes ago,
uh, I dissed the old generation,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, DJ short is the old generation,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to give him mad love.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's one of the guys back in the day that
was doing it right for genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it weren't for DJ short, I don't think
you and I would be where we are in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis game.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't think anyone would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, DJ's done a lot for the
preservation and just everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might be a brick in the wall,
but DJ short was part of the foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornerstone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So up there with some of the original
authors and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are guys like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'll give sub cool mad credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, he's not as old as sub cool or as a
DJ short, but he's in that generation
[SPEAKER_01]: between them, between us and DJ.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got to give him mad love for his
breeding and for what he did for the
[SPEAKER_01]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, since we're shutting down breeders
and if we're going to go with old guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys know, I'm going to say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soma deserves a high five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big namaste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone taught me how to grow on OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not know anything about,
I'd never, I'd read so much posts,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I never realized he was a dreadlock
and I never knew he was a dirty hippie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't know he had amethyst
everywhere and crystals on everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured he was an Indian dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: The country India.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my friend Donovan one day,
uh, who was a big user of overgrow.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he was always on there and one day
he's like, bro, you remind me so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much of Soma, the way that you talk
because I was preaching my grow from your
[SPEAKER_01]: heart theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like go in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I still think this, you got to go in
your grow room once in a while and just
[SPEAKER_01]: sit there and just meditate and just close
your eyes and think about the goodness
[SPEAKER_01]: that those plants are going to do because
you're growing a plant that is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: heal somebody in some sort of way.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to feel better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if they're a recreational smoker,
if they're a medical smoker, somebody is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be uplifted and better because of
the product that you're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's got to feel good inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I go in there and kind of meditate a
little bit on that and feel that goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'd share it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants love me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they heal somebody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that person hugs me when they see me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next time they go, dude,
that grateful dog was so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I get to go grow better weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got a good hug and it just
perpetuates this golden cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was talking about that exact hippie
shit that I just said, and my buddy's
[SPEAKER_01]: like, dude, you're like fucking Soma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I've heard of Soma.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've read his posts and he's like,
no, go get his book.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went and got his book and I was
like, this guy is who I was going to be in
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I didn't know there was already this
guy, you know, like, I was already on the
[SPEAKER_01]: path of being Soma.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just got off on a random tangent of
giving a DJ short.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did no till organic before any of y'all
thought of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As cool as it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's doing nothing new there.
[SPEAKER_00]: True.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soma has been on time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I built beds like his.
[SPEAKER_00]: I built them out of Rubbermaid containers,
but I used the same, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: principle with the drainage and
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can support 99% of what Soma says.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sub cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love his growing style.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes he says some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I'm not going to put my signature on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, uh, I don't discredit that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dude's got fucking integrity.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's made a lot of strains and,
uh, he was one of the first people to take
[SPEAKER_00]: good pictures, um, uh, with a good camera
buds and send them into high times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody that's followed me on Facebook
since the beginning knows without any
[SPEAKER_01]: saying that fucking sub cool inspired 50%
of my photography.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I got a lot of the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have a real similar style now
that you mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our grow style.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our photography style.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the whole thing is kind of,
and I didn't know that until someone's
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you should check out the weed nerd.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot to learn in some of his
older episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in the way he does
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, sub cool on the YouTube, the YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sound like an old guy when I say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The weed nerd.
[SPEAKER_01]: The weed nerd.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The older stuff is really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: There came a point when it got to be too,
uh, redundant, redundant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had bangs for 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even he knows that he says it all the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm getting to it a hundred
episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's only so much you could talk
about about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's always news and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I fall to the news
sometimes, but it's going to be now that
[SPEAKER_01]: once we get to episode a hundred,
we're going to go a little more in depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gone through the basics and now it's
time to dig in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think our friends are listeners
periscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a really great tool for a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been opening periscope and doing
random shit on there occasionally,
[SPEAKER_01]: but now that we've got this good
foundation, you guys have had your basic
[SPEAKER_01]: rudimentary classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's almost time around episode a
hundred to start pushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It and start going to the B level courses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to college level you guys here
pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get a Sean back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have to get out the notepad again.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we're going to wrap this part up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been going for a long time,
dude, Jesse, thanks for coming,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do the outdoor update real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, here lately in Southern Colorado,
at least, uh, it has been cold and humid
[SPEAKER_00]: at night and hot and dry during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a recipe for powdery mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, bud rot, um, it's part of the
reason Cali bud stands out and they get a
[SPEAKER_00]: Marine layer with this too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, you know, this year I've seen
some, a lot of Cali style or what I always
[SPEAKER_00]: call Cali style problems that we've never
had here before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be prepared for that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we prevent getting powdery mildew
with these crispy cold nights that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting?
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of moisture in the air
tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's, I mean, any number of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm personally using Actinovate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're in bloom too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it's, you know, it's, I see it on
the cucumbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it on the squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it on the watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's a different strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it doesn't really affect, um,
cannabis from what I've seen and been
[SPEAKER_00]: told.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but to me, it's an indication that
the, the climate for to grow is present.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't speak on that now, but in the
next, within the next 30 days,
[SPEAKER_01]: I am going to become what is called
applicator certified by the department of
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: My cousin's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's, uh, it seems the I've looked
at the test.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to be fairly easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an open book test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, somebody that works, I'm now the lead
grower myself and my friend John are now
[SPEAKER_01]: the lead growers at the spot dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today we had our first pre-inspection
from the department of agriculture before
[SPEAKER_01]: we grow anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're, uh, in our new grow areas,
dude, it's, I've only been out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry for what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things have changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have a department of
agriculture meetings is about an hour and
[SPEAKER_01]: a half long meeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: They told us, uh, basically what we need
to do to be compliant, which is it's all
[SPEAKER_01]: basic stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's mostly since the spot was
designed, what's the shit that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: already doing, but you have to have one,
at least one person, uh, on the staff that
[SPEAKER_01]: can train employees.
[SPEAKER_01]: On a pesticide and insecticide and
fungicide safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I took it upon myself to say,
Hey, I'm lead grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, uh, the boss is going to pay for
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's a work related thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's something that I feel like I
should do anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when they offered that course,
I was like, I want to go to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to go to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's great, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within 30 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will, uh, I have to take the test to the
spot too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some, uh, owners would be really
pissed about having to do shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you got to, in the cannabis industry,
you got to, you got to allegedly spend
[SPEAKER_01]: money to fucking make money in the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, it is hard to survive right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have some money to put in
inventory, if your shelves aren't stocked
[SPEAKER_01]: with 20 different kinds of buds,
if your shelves aren't stocked with 20
[SPEAKER_01]: different kinds of edibles, four different
topicals, a lollipop over here,
[SPEAKER_01]: some t-shirts over here, socks over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys got to fill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Japanese or Chinese water pipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, good water pipes, Chinese water pipes,
knockoff nails, high end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to, uh, three rivers organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some cool, uh, hitman shit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your eyes are really red.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a fat fat dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just over here coughing and only saying
short sentences.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it match my red in my shirt yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty close.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, back to the outdoor stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, let's go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, Actinovate, um, green cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really see that as a preventative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but if you do use it, make sure you
use it at night and follow the directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, whatever, you know, there's all kinds
of stuff you can be spraying on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get it, get a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just stay away from neem oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, since it's all your plants should be
in bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I was gifted a product called style it
oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've heard of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a consultation and somebody,
an older gentleman, uh, who is not as able
[SPEAKER_01]: bodied as most of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a little, he's a little slower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might call him handicapped.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's trying to grow his own cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's his first grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the second group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I gave him a free consultation and he
had just the starts of powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, man, I, and he was in
about, uh, starting week three of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, man, I don't really want
you to spray anything on there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're going to lose your crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, I Googled some stuff and they
say oils and things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, don't put neem oil on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, put some worm casting tea on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The world didn't do a damn thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's most definitely preventative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't do shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I told him, I said, well, you're going
to, this crop is going to be fucked
[SPEAKER_01]: because the powdery mildew was getting,
it wasn't thick, but you could see it
[SPEAKER_01]: popping up in the little circles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I said, I've got a product called
style it oil that I've never used.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a friend of mine sent it to me to
encourage me to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said that it will destroy powdery
mildew on contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, spray it on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's an old dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, this is your medicine that you're
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, yes, I know I need this spray
that on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knew what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, it was his decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sprayed the style it oil on there,
dude, that shit took down the powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew on contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: It destroyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never actually used it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard, uh, you can burn the shit out
some plants with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the things, uh, a guy named,
I don't know if I should say his real
[SPEAKER_01]: name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he's known as tree town is what I know
him as a tree town farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the one that recommended this to me
and hooked me up with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A vendor for the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, check this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, I didn't, I didn't have anything
to use it on in my grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I didn't have any mildew or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when this dude was like, I got powdery
mildew, I was like, this is what I've got
[SPEAKER_01]: to offer you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And something about the way that it coats
the leaves, uh, it causes, it breaks the
[SPEAKER_01]: membrane of the powdery mildew and it
doesn't allow it to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: On your leaf is basically what I read.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when that shit hit the leaf,
it just washed it right off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we did it with the lights off,
turn the lights off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just turn a normal lamp on.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you should with most pesticides
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: With any, with any spray, you want the
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a few that you actually need the
lights on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but sometimes you need to heat the
room up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the deal is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You actually need to heat the room to
activate the oils in the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while we sprayed it with the,
the, uh, the stylet oil and then let it
[SPEAKER_01]: sit over a night and then we went back the
next morning and rinsed the stylet oil off
[SPEAKER_01]: with just clean water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also very important for most pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to unclog the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to be able to breathe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go and rinse that shit off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then do those plants just came out of
it and they're amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got to harvest his crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was several weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he got to harvest his crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I helped him trim some of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I showed him how to trim it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, no signs of powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gorgeous crop smelled pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I haven't smoked any of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so I don't know if it tastes like
stylet oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he's an older cat.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been, he's like your dad,
you know, just needs a bunch of herb to
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke so he doesn't get hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is stylet oil?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, you know, I don't have it in this
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have had it handy before I
brought it up, but I wasn't prepared for
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fail on my part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a white oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did some research on it once.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said white.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, I'm not, it's not colored white.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just considered a white oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not thick and white or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I heard about it, it was kind of pre
Amazon times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I just couldn't get my hands on
it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's available now and it's cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually quite affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a preventative as an outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need to rescue something,
it's something you could look into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you hit it just right, we'll,
we'll take care of a light infestation,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's kind of touchy too.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's anything when you're in the flowering
phase and applying a foliar spray of any
[SPEAKER_01]: type is a touchy situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: De-leafing, just removing the leaf out of
and taking it out of the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, washing your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't touch them when they're,
when it's wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually, I've been told it spreads
easier at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, that's something I've been told.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't been able to put that to work
too much, but yeah, haven't had a need to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you've got powdery mildew in your
grow room, you've got something to correct
[SPEAKER_01]: in the room and you've got some work to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take you a little bit to fix
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can not spray away that problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an environmental problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to clean it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to start getting fresh air out of
the, or fresh air into the room,
[SPEAKER_01]: stale air out of the room, lower the
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but if you get it also, don't feel
bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it can even happen outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that shit happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked about having it in a grow
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happened the first time I moved into a
new house.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was August when I moved in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that first winter crop,
I got powdery mildew on the back corner of
[SPEAKER_01]: the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it was the concrete basement wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's drastic climate change or season
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier to run that room in the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably wasn't prepared for that powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a damn master grower and I got powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was just five or six years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been told that when I talk about a
powdery mold and both of us, I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: told that we make people feel bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't feel bad if it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you guys, a person at the store told
me that the other day, I know I post
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing pictures on Instagram,
but it's cause I just don't take pictures
[SPEAKER_01]: of my fails.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never take a picture of your poops,
do you?
[SPEAKER_01]: You just post the gold on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't worry you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will, I'll fuck something up and post a
picture of it on Instagram just for fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to show you that Rasta Jeff fucks up
once in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some fuck ups recently,
so shit happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next time I make a mistake,
I'll get out the camera and I'll own that
[SPEAKER_01]: shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like, look, this is my dumbness
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine's when I get lazy or busy in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I overflowed a reservoir the other day,
straight into the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was only a couple of gallons of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, when you hear that shit
overflow, I was only a few feet away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had my back turned.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just totally focused on what I was
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I heard, I was like, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just sit there and you feel like a
slow kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, I'm going to have to take the
short bus to work tomorrow after this
[SPEAKER_01]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was with some people that in the early
days, we were filling Rezzes and took off
[SPEAKER_00]: to lunch and went to the bar, had a couple
beers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Came back two and a half hours later and
water was still running.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you guys have to swim?
[SPEAKER_01]: To the reservoir?
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, it was a big, like an old
mechanic shop, just a big still building
[SPEAKER_00]: with a roll up door on one side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was still real early days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was most definitely trap house worthy,
but it was an early legal grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just roll up the door and it was a
blast back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day, you could do all kinds of
dumb shit that you can't do now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to smoke in the dispenser.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke in the grow while you're working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we had our grow and our dispensary
was attached.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were one floor was the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: One floor was the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would be, I'd have, we had a
camera, of course, with the monitor up
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could just look at the monitor and
hear the doorbell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd be watering plants and smoking a
fat joint, just watering plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: living my life, got reggae on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you hear the doorbell and just
run downstairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't even put out the joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just set it on the counter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got hot in that building.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen barefoot and shirtless felons
working in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck felons running them originally.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the signs used to be made on like
cardboard with like little hippie drawings
[SPEAKER_01]: and colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like my girlfriend did it and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's how it was done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there was nothing printed on a
printer back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no barcode on any weed product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all just grown in someone's
basement or upstairs from the,
[SPEAKER_01]: from the dispensary and then trimmed and
then brought right immediately to the grow
[SPEAKER_01]: or to the dispensary, put in a jar and
sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just, what do you mean we had some
weed and just turned into money?
[SPEAKER_00]: And despite all that, certain shops still
just boom had the fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to be better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the dispensary grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the grow was grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like honest, I used to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked at Metamar dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the manager.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend, Tom was the owner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the manager right underneath him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tom handed me the keys one day and he was
like, here, you got a dispensary,
[SPEAKER_01]: have fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he paid me very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I worked at this dispensary and I would
grow cherry widow at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my own home growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would take that cherry widow to
the shop and sell it to the boss for a
[SPEAKER_01]: decent price, put it on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the most fire we,
we had in there that week.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
