[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get into the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
I have officially pressed record.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're hanging out with two of my good
friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're hanging out with Tall Clint,
Clint Stewart.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been here on the show before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was the cannabis amateur.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The non-cannabis, not even an amateur.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other guy on the other side of the
table is my good buddy, Wade Ridley.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say what's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: Word.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that Wade's an amateur.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't call him a professional.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wade can smoke, but he's not a level 10
black belt.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I am not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of these guys are local aspiring
comedians.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're also my bros.
[SPEAKER_02]: We brought Tall Clint back because I
really liked having him ask Cannabis 101
[SPEAKER_02]: questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: The crowd demanded you back, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Appreciate it, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for calling me back.
Applause.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the wind of the dusty city.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: I felt it over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the old west out here again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I'm glad Missouri got over that
tornado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Poor sound effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was Oklahoma, wasn't that?
I don't know what that was.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're off to a stellar start.
[SPEAKER_02]: My buddy Wade, we were talking about his
level.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd probably put him in a blue belt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know where that is in the level of
belts, comparatively speaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're speaking my color.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right in the middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: You like that color, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well then, cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would take myself at a five to a six.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's it?
[SPEAKER_05]: White, blue, brown, black?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say white, yellow, orange,
blue, purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I was talking jujitsu.
[SPEAKER_02]: They only got four belts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wherever I went, they gave us a lot of
belts.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sold belts out the ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you get the next one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't you want that one with the stripes
on it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, dude, I did have to... Actually,
we did get stripes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They put yellow stripes on your white belt
so that they can tease you.
[SPEAKER_02]: They give you the pretest.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're ready to test.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now at the test time, you can actually pay
the money to take the real test to buy the
[SPEAKER_02]: real nice belt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Suck a dick.
[SPEAKER_02]: What were you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just realizing where I went to karate
class.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the Ponzi scheme of fucking karate
is what it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to bring in two friends before you
can get to the yellow belt.
[SPEAKER_05]: But don't worry.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll pay you out with the black belt at
the end, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're bringing like eight people into
class.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're rocking that purple belt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's my Amway card, you fucking asshole.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't do the splits, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody cares.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a purple belt.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, iGrow Culture?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got two comedians in the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is getting weird all fucking ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: Already.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Clint has not been... Clint does not
smoke and I've tried to pass him a pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Waze tried to pass him a pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had the guy that was here earlier
hanging out with us, tried to pass him a
[SPEAKER_02]: pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when he said, I don't smoke,
you looked at him like, why are you here?
[SPEAKER_02]: He got worried.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking narc.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, to his defense, he is slightly
retarded.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not Clint, but the dude that was here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Clint included.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go call the people
retarded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm slightly...
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint needed a helmet earlier in life than
he got one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to kind of segue.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are both comedians.
[SPEAKER_02]: You perform on stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do bits that are prepared and also a
little bit of improv.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking earlier about the use of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wade, I'm going to blush your balls.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do smoke weed before you perform.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're pretty cool about people
knowing that, I hope, because I just said
[SPEAKER_02]: that on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Wade does participate in cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_02]: I say your weed use is more medicinal than
recreational.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is 100% medicinal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It keeps my shit straight, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're a high strong dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're high right now and you're still
high strong as fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: I walked about eight miles a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This dude's fired up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're talking about the differences
between Clint not smoking because he
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't drink or smoke at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pussy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, there's no disrespect to you big
pussy, but we're just mentioning that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you think that smoking, before you
perform your show, helps you out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or does it hinder your show?
[SPEAKER_05]: So do you remember when you first smoked?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes tolerance, I guess, to build up
to where you could to get past all of the,
[SPEAKER_05]: in the beginning, like the paranoia,
to get past the, this is actually stoned
[SPEAKER_05]: and feels good.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the beginning, when I would get too
high, I would sit there and lose track and
[SPEAKER_05]: lose thought, or maybe I wasn't in enough
concentration and focus, but I would learn
[SPEAKER_05]: with marijuana how to do it, essentially.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I have a great little medicinal
level to where I sit at and I don't have
[SPEAKER_05]: to go overboard.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have to do anything like brash and
over medicate because that's what you want
[SPEAKER_05]: to tend to do at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your anxiety is like jacked.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're through the roof and you're like,
I need, I used to suck a bowl,
[SPEAKER_05]: no shit, right before my set.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would leave the comic who would perform
before me for five minutes and I would
[SPEAKER_05]: shotgun a bowl so goddamn fast,
go inside, get up on stage.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would crowd work for the first minute of
my set to get over the, like the cough and
[SPEAKER_05]: the high, the initial.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I would go into my material.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I remembered it all the way
through, I would kill.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then if I didn't, then it sucked.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how long did it take to find your
threshold for more?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm a musician.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that same threshold to where I
can't keep time if I get too high and I
[SPEAKER_02]: know that and you get panicky,
start doing dumb shit on stage to try to
[SPEAKER_02]: cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long did it take you to find your
little threshold zone to where you knew
[SPEAKER_02]: how high you could be?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say a good eight months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, were you smoking the first time you
performed comedy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you high?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Extremely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you didn't have to learn how to do
comedy and be high at separate times.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just, you were already high doing
it your first time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a little bit of a lucky background
of, of, uh, being sort of a public
[SPEAKER_05]: speaker.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in management for a little while and
I also did acting.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the acting thing, like I just started
smoking weed two years ago, like on the
[SPEAKER_05]: reg.
[SPEAKER_02]: We took Wade to the, uh, Wade was kind of
an amateur until he went to the secret a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of, but he was a huge amateur.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would, he would come over and hang out
and I would give them dabs one,
[SPEAKER_02]: one day and it would, it would fuck him up
for the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: He told me that he took a nap for eight
hours and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, we took him to the secret cup and
he sat next to me at the secret cup where
[SPEAKER_02]: we were getting down and I looked at him
and I told him pretty much you're in the
[SPEAKER_02]: big leagues buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started giving him man dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from then on, I quit giving him the
little amateur dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I decided he got his purple belt that day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, so two years from till now,
dude, he really stepped up the game.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's, uh, I love marijuana and I
feel like I gave it an unfair shot for
[SPEAKER_05]: only 34 years of my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm giving it all fair shots that I
can.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it improves everything that I've done
so far, because I know a lot of people say
[SPEAKER_05]: that it, it, it makes you go all,
all, all over the place.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for someone like me, that is wild.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm already all over the place.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what marijuana does for me is focus
more than anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, tell me more about that first 34 years
that you said you were biased on
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: I fucking hated all of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of us potheads.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I would specifically blame it,
uh, on my, on my brother going back to
[SPEAKER_05]: high school.
[SPEAKER_05]: My brother was scouted by like major
division one universities for football
[SPEAKER_05]: when he was in seventh grade, started
smoking weed around ninth grade.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he, uh, gradually declined to where he
quit playing football by his junior,
[SPEAKER_05]: senior year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I blamed marijuana a lot for this
because I watched his life and I watched
[SPEAKER_05]: my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I watched a lot of my friends
around me that smoked weed and everything
[SPEAKER_05]: like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was, I was very judgmental of all of
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I found out it wasn't just,
it wasn't weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were just losers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was a douchebag.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a personality trait.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's all it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really was.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and that was just us as young kids.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was me in my twenties.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, and then I went to Vegas and in
Las Vegas, I was there for four years to
[SPEAKER_05]: get away from my ex fiance, which I
decided to keep around in my life for
[SPEAKER_05]: several years afterwards, which led to me
doing, um, about three anti-psychotics,
[SPEAKER_05]: a couple of antidepressants and a couple
of, uh, sleeping medications a day to calm
[SPEAKER_05]: down these major hives that would break
out all over my body.
[SPEAKER_05]: All prescribed?
[SPEAKER_05]: All prescribed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, good question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Las Vegas, so you never know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, they, this, this was all given to me
to initially get rid of these hives that
[SPEAKER_05]: were breaking out all over my body at
random times and in situations.
[SPEAKER_05]: That were just from anxiety?
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mostly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, but, but no one knew the dermatologist
and no regular doctors.
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally, someone said, go see a shrink.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, great, I'm going to go see you
shrink.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're like, you fucked up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally, I knew it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they put me on all this shit and I
would find myself at a stoplight and I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: driving my truck, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've got this smile on my face,
but inside my head, I'm like, why?
[SPEAKER_05]: I, there's no, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not happy for any reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not sad for any reason either.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just, there's no, I'm not,
I'm not this, I'm not this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then like, I would turn on the shower
and just forget that it was on and not in
[SPEAKER_05]: a weed way, but just, it was on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I found myself needing like
Klonopin was one, the specific one that I
[SPEAKER_05]: knew that worked like they could
immediately get rid of the hives.
[SPEAKER_05]: Boom, gone later.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is, what is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Klonopin is an anti, uh, anxiety and,
uh, anti-psychotic I believe is what they
[SPEAKER_05]: used it for.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like it immediately can calm down some
anxiety, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it, it, it worked for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it didn't work for me, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I moved from Vegas, went to new
Orleans.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I got to new Orleans, I no longer had
the insurance, but no longer the will to
[SPEAKER_05]: actually like take these pills.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate being slaves to things in my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I quit and a year or so went by and I
knew that I still needed something.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I finally decided.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, being in new Orleans, marijuana is
prevalent down there, although it is very
[SPEAKER_05]: expensive because it can be rare.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you can't really grow it down there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll fuck your shit up, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, I'm going to try a weed and I'm
going to, I'm going to give it a control
[SPEAKER_05]: point.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm going to try it this many
times.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I hate it, I'm going to get past
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's called the old college try.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and I just wanted to be educated
about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I was like, I don't want to be
stupid.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm, I'm 30 at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm 34 and I'm going to be smart about
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: It took three, two and a half tries.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, I don't need, I don't need
any more to know that this is good for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and I haven't stopped.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: How good for me in the no anxiety,
like the anxiety that I have now is
[SPEAKER_05]: justified.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I'm about ready to go on stage in
front of like maybe a hundred people with
[SPEAKER_05]: words that like, I don't know if they're
going to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe not even the tested stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it's going to work every
time in a different town, in a different
[SPEAKER_05]: town that doesn't know references that
maybe I've grown up with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not even, not even that just,
you know, and that's why like the public
[SPEAKER_03]: seems so different is because we,
we only have a couple of spots.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's always, it's kind of always the
same audience.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you want to write new stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, but when you're moving out and the
stuff that does work down here,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're thinking, oh good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get to go use it up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've never heard the stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, and I completely, but it's never a
hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you might be taken a knife to a
gunfight up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could be, well, I mean, you just,
even on a good room, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: but, but I can understand your anxiety
over stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's how it helps me.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's justified anxiety.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's how it helps me now throughout
the day and outside of county.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wake up at 5 a.m.
[SPEAKER_05]: every morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: I go to bed around 11 to midnight.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have children.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm single.
[SPEAKER_05]: I sleep for like five.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have like five, I get like five hours of
sleep and it's because like the corporate
[SPEAKER_05]: world teaches you how to be this machine,
this perfect machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you were in the military also.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the two of them have got you kind of
robot mode.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, but they don't teach you how to not
be a machine.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they don't teach you how to shut it off
because they want you thinking about work
[SPEAKER_05]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would be, and I still do now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like I consume myself with all these,
not only my comedy, but all my fucked up
[SPEAKER_05]: thoughts, like everybody else has,
and they keep me awake and I wake up at 5
[SPEAKER_05]: a.m.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I don't smoke weed, like,
like I immediately wake up and walk five
[SPEAKER_05]: miles and that's no lie.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm heavily sedated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So would you be an advocate that cannabis
does help PTF?
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are states that are not allowing
that as a reason, a valid reason for
[SPEAKER_02]: medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anybody that's listening, you just
heard Wade mostly described PTSD and
[SPEAKER_02]: depression.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depression 100% is what his cannabis use
is helping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you, I know you're new and you're,
you hang out with me and a couple other
[SPEAKER_02]: guys that are kind of, we know what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a strain that works best for
you or a strain that doesn't work for you?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know you, you're not as well versed
in some of us and that's why we've got
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint and you here because you guys are
going to help me connect with the newer
[SPEAKER_02]: folks that are listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I got you guys here for.
[SPEAKER_05]: The best, the last best thing that I've
tried out from, from the samples that I've
[SPEAKER_05]: tried, uh, the veganic, lemon,
Jeffrey, no lie, uh, broke some shit off.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that's some shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's mostly sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost a pure sativa.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, dab wise, you're not beating your
grateful dog or your Girl Scout cookie.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's hands down and weed wise that GSC
show me something, show me something
[SPEAKER_05]: that's going up against that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That girl's got cookies is a hell of a
strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I would have bred that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not share that shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I wanted to talk a little bit
more, uh, I'm going to whisper something
[SPEAKER_02]: to you because I want to know if I have
permission to talk about something.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I want to talk about some lab testing
right quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you said that lemon Jeffrey,
I took some, uh, samples to steep hill,
[SPEAKER_02]: halent labs in Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the lemon Jeffrey, uh, it was grown
veganically.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was bred by me, grown by me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we hit 24.34% THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: A total cannabinoid content on that was 26
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, let me make sure I'm not lying.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 25.3.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really small print on my phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: 25.3% cannabinoids on the lemon Jeffrey
searching my phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking for the grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got several tests in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: 24.8.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was something similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Similar to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're really close.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, 23.3 to THC a, and then for a total of
24.3.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the strains were breathing that you
guys are getting to smoke around here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting spoiled.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for us amateurs, let's go over a couple
of basics here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you're here for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause, um, um, I'm going to ask,
uh, when you say THC, I know, I know a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of us know what THC is, but just to start
out with some guys maybe from wherever the
[SPEAKER_03]: don't know THC being the thing that gets
you high.
Correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, there are several active cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually trying to get to the steep
hill website while I'm doing this so that
[SPEAKER_02]: we can, uh, uh, maybe they have a chart of
cannabinoids on there to give me a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of a guide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be really cool to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, and then cannabinoids was my
other question was, uh, so the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids are the part that,
uh, they work in conjunction with
[SPEAKER_02]: turpinoids, flavonoids and a few other
molecules, but it's mostly cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are molecules.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially, essentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they call them, uh, compounds is
what I think they actually call them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a scientist, but I, I,
I stay more in the grow room, but when I
[SPEAKER_02]: play one on TV, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I stayed at a holiday.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I pay, I paid these guys to do the test
because they are hotel four 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven 10, seven 10 or they test for CBG,
a CBG, THC, THC, a THC V THC by itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: D eight THC THC V CBN a CBN CBDA CBD,
CBC, CBC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there's a negative sign.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know what that negative sign
means, but for the most part that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking for, honestly was the THC,
the THC a, um, those are all cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_02]: and the, the CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the basic cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: The THC is the one, uh, that gives you the
head high that makes you kind of,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, that's like more psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_02]: The CBD is the one that's more body
oriented, more analgesic, more relaxing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the CBD is what's helping weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the, the opposite is the one that's
helped correct the THC because it makes
[SPEAKER_02]: him, I think it lifts your brain up out of
the depression.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes sure it's uplifting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It spins you up out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the CBD, however, is the one that
they're giving to kids for seizures and
[SPEAKER_02]: epilepsy problems and autism and tumors
and such.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is getting rid or stopping
cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people is CBD, CBD rich
medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to brag here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a cut that was given to me from
my friend, Joey at natural mystic cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: caregivers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, he got it from our good friends at DNA
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew this Tora Bora.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it came in the THC, not impressive
4.97, but the CBD content on this bad dog
[SPEAKER_02]: was 8.56%.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a two to one CBD to THC ratio,
which means this is perfect for those sick
[SPEAKER_02]: folks that don't want to get high,
but needs some medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, this is the one we've got a patient,
a friend of mine, good brother,
[SPEAKER_02]: who's going through some turmoil right now
with his health, but he came over and
[SPEAKER_02]: we've talked about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't feel good.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was on a cane.
[SPEAKER_02]: He felt like shit mentally, physically,
and spiritually.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had some dabs of that Tora Bora and
stood up and forgot his cane and got all
[SPEAKER_02]: the way up the stairs and turned around
and shouted, will you bring me my cane?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the power of CBD medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to visualize myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, uh, when, so, so it sounds like 25 is
huge as a THC, um, uh, content.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a, that's a good, uh, good
reference point to ask for, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: high, anything over, uh, the guy told me
anything over 13% is considered high,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the growers and breeders and
dispensary guys, we look for anything 18
[SPEAKER_02]: to 21 is satisfactory.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, some of the highest there's reports of
29s and thirties, but that's questionable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, 26 and 27 are remarkable.
[SPEAKER_02]: My good buddy Spencer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to give Spencer a shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, Spence?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is up Spencer?
[SPEAKER_02]: He was here last time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spencer's the shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spence is a cool bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: He grew a strain that I bred.
[SPEAKER_02]: So funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know like two black guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knocked on my door and he goes,
black people here are black people here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think is what he said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Black folk are black people here.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's so cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Capleton hit 29 or 20.59.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that's impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Spence grew Rhian's rhino from another
breeder and that hit 25.9% THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: The total, uh, was 27.2 with 3.1%
terpenoids in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't even pay them to test for the
terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were just so blown away that they
wanted to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if somebody had one, would we direct
them to that, um, website or something?
[SPEAKER_03]: If they wanted to get their stuff tested,
since they're being pretty cool about
[SPEAKER_03]: testing your stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, uh, I'm affiliated with,
uh, labs and things or with a dispensary
[SPEAKER_02]: and things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just, uh, kind of changed the
rules like two days ago to where now you
[SPEAKER_02]: have to be a licensed facility to get
anything through the testing facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about that on the
over-regulation is costing legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to America, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to give Spence a shout out one
more time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry to interrupt that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a weed show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interrupt all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Girl scout cookies grown by Spence at the
garden of Weeden, 26.89% THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: You fucking, you goddamn stoners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Total cannabinoid content, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: 29.2%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the fuck on.
[SPEAKER_02]: 29.2 from Spence in the garden of Weeden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, follow that dude at, at garden of
Weeden.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there might be a the, but I'm
pretty sure it's at garden of Weeden on
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go to high times real quick
and look at their, uh, high times
[SPEAKER_02]: strongest strains because I don't want to
misquote myself and say what I think the
[SPEAKER_02]: OG ghost train haze came in at.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I could spell strongest,
it'd be helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: T sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking and fucking taping here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just saying, I said what I was
typing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: The garden of Weeden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, uh, no dis dispense.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not the first person I've heard use
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying the, the originality of,
of, of marijuana names for things never
[SPEAKER_05]: ceases to amaze me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just the names that you guys choose to
take and like form into the weed culture
[SPEAKER_05]: is, is amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's probably something for like
garbage truck that is just like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we can name everything something
cooler than it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, in 2013, this highest strain listed
that I find on this little thing on high
[SPEAKER_02]: times is 24.79.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to do another Google search
because I am confident there needs to be
[SPEAKER_02]: something higher because I don't want to
go shit in our pants that we did higher
[SPEAKER_02]: than those.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not seeing garden of Weeden on
Instagram, so it might be, Oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: this will be a video.
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be sound.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to mute the garden of Weeden and
it's a W E E D N.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have, I just thought that that
might matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just realized that W E E D E N,
uh, no E just N weed N.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, see, here we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, are we following people on Instagram?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just, I'm just so God damn cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said that I actually meant the
listeners, but you know, Bruce Banner,
[SPEAKER_02]: number three, 28.35% was their winner for
one of these years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bruce Banner, some good Spence and I are
keeping up with those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're keeping up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Garden of weed and yeah, I got it now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clint's following them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I want to get back to Wade for one
second.
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked for permission.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I, uh, mention your dad, dude?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Wade's dad is an elderly gentleman.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've honestly never met him, but I've been
heavily involved with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's 78 years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been kind of helping these guys
figure out and guide his, uh, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: short stint with medical marijuana use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I heard that the old guy was having
problems and I kind of jokingly said,
[SPEAKER_02]: give him some pot cookies or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Wade was like, no, I want to,
but my mom disagrees with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after some persuasion, I took me about
three months, three months of persuasion
[SPEAKER_02]: on mom research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, uh, tell them what actually,
I think what actually sent them over the
[SPEAKER_02]: convincing edge to let them do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm referring to the Facebook article
that I did or, uh, remember are you
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about the brave?
[SPEAKER_05]: I asked, uh, well, I made them,
uh, so basically attacking my dad or not
[SPEAKER_05]: attacking, but the plan of attack for my
dad was having as much information as I
[SPEAKER_05]: could and having as much information I
could is hard for someone who is not
[SPEAKER_05]: familiar.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess you could say with the type of
contacts to get such information.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you could look it all up and
everything like that, but when it comes
[SPEAKER_05]: down to it, there's a lot of people that
are going to be coming in from out of the
[SPEAKER_05]: state that will look at the products and
be like, I, I, I'd love it, but I really
[SPEAKER_05]: don't know what I'm getting.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I didn't want that to happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't want to not have that
information.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wasn't sure what was going down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jeff took it upon himself.
[SPEAKER_05]: He got a hold of Chiba choose himself on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was like, yo, this is a scenario.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what hurts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where can I get this or what is the best
method of use?
[SPEAKER_05]: She would choose is like, you can't get
that where you're at, but this is what you
[SPEAKER_05]: can get.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they answered in less than an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're a huge company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for them to just got at me within an
hour, like that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when I took all of this information to
my dad, I was like, listen, dad,
[SPEAKER_05]: you, my dad, my dad has a 12 pound hernia
that sits in his front.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like a volleyball just always
sticking out.
[SPEAKER_05]: He has to hunch over.
[SPEAKER_05]: He worked at the steel mill for,
for 50 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he can hardly walk.
[SPEAKER_05]: He can hardly sit and he has to take
painkillers and it fucks them up bad,
[SPEAKER_05]: man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It messes them up emotionally.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it messes your body up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, dad, listen, these pills
are given to you by, by a doctor that
[SPEAKER_05]: really doesn't give a shit about you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's given them to you because the,
the people that are telling him to give
[SPEAKER_05]: them to you, make money off of your
Medicaid.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm asking you to take the Chiba chew
because I love you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't want your pain to,
to, to affect your daily life anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he took them, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: He took them for about two and a half to
three months.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was doing edibles strong.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I think my mom got involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was showing signs of having too much
fun at Walmart as one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: conversations.
[SPEAKER_05]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_05]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what though?
[SPEAKER_03]: If somebody's having fun at Walmart,
there's something wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, well, no, I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, my mom was like, my mom wasn't used to
the adjustment period of getting high.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my dad is, is learning how to get high
and he's 78 years old and these receptors
[SPEAKER_05]: have never been used.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's taken an edible and he's high.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was like, I don't think I'm high.
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you pass me some water?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and you're like, you're fucking
high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, at least it's water and not more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because as we discussed on the last part,
no, no, no, this is, this is, don't take
[SPEAKER_05]: too much.
[SPEAKER_05]: It did happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what did happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he was like, he's like, I want to feel
like the pills make me feel.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, well, fucking let's go.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I was like, you could just bite
off as much as that shit as you want dad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to kill you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may freak out a little.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, be careful.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I was like, if you like it,
go for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't then.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take a nap bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause that's probably what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, you're old.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went from getting him the pure CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was, Wade kind of tasked me for
being in charge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I knew that was my job, you know,
in this circle.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my job.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're old man's sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're thinking about weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll talk to you about it as a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're a good guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I went to, uh, I, I obtained the
proper CBD dosage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought he would want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the old guy's like, I want to get
fucked up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm old.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm missing that head spin from the pills.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly what I said.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a little bit of THC and he's like,
bring it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He kept any it up, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like more THC and then until
finally mama cut them off.
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently it's because she doesn't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: She was the only one not in the party
basically because my dad would walk,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, and he'd just kind of stand
there and he's just kind of chilling.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's just not really, you know,
he's not being a crab ass.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my mom thinks something's wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're just kind of like, no,
ma, ma, he's fucking high.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's just high liquid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking started that box of macaroni and
cheese.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's heaven because man look into
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, uh, you know, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And did it help him?
[SPEAKER_05]: Did it help him?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, not only did it help,
uh, cause he was able, he didn't,
[SPEAKER_05]: my, my father has to take a nap every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Has to, he, it's gotta be about a three
hour to four, four hour nap every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he can get through the whole day when
he was on the edibles.
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't have to take a nap.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was active.
[SPEAKER_05]: His mood was better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, he, he was acting like he was like a
human.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not to say that he's sub human without
weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, did the time you guys spent while you
were high together improve?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm burping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Improve your relationship at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: TMZ.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mean to pry into the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's too much, you can tell me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I can tell you, no, no, no,
not, not at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can tell you this much.
[SPEAKER_05]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have about zero conversations,
serious conversations with my father,
[SPEAKER_05]: especially about a his health.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never really given a shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: This cannabis topic is mostly all I've
heard about your father.
[SPEAKER_05]: You talk about our friendship.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't, uh, it's not, it's not a
subject that, uh, I approach.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is the, let's just say there's a reason
why comics are comics.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a lot to do with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when he's high, did he quit?
[SPEAKER_02]: You said he wasn't a crab ass.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, he wasn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you could tell the dude, you could tell
how pills affect the attitude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you take Oxycontin all day long
and your brain is just tired of it,
[SPEAKER_05]: those receptors in your brain,
when you wake up the next morning,
[SPEAKER_05]: they're burnt, but, but your body wants it
still.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you hurt.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you gotta take another.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, not only do you hurt, but your
addiction hurts too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So your receptors are like, I need this,
but then I need more of it, but you're
[SPEAKER_05]: draining the melatonin in your body the
entire time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this like, and at that time that
affects your, your entire attitude,
[SPEAKER_05]: man.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you could see it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see it in old people.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're fucking mean all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause they're up on Oxycontin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's try to find a happy medium
between a couple of pills and half a Chiba
[SPEAKER_02]: Choo form or something to where mama
thinks he's doing all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's what was going down.
[SPEAKER_05]: He would go to Walmart and when he would
take the pills, you know, he's zipping
[SPEAKER_05]: around, but he doesn't know he's hurt when
he's on the pills.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you take the weed, he's on the weed,
but he's aware of his pain.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_05]: So when he's aware of his pain,
he's acting in a different way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my mother did not, does not know how
to handle that.
[SPEAKER_05]: The transition for her, for someone that
is a non-smoker to see someone of 40
[SPEAKER_05]: years, her husband, that is now trying to
be introduced into this culture that she
[SPEAKER_05]: had to be conned into.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They grew up in the time where marijuana
was the devil.
[SPEAKER_05]: She admits that freely.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's like, listen, I don't like it
because reefer madness, exact quote.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's programmed into her head,
dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she, she hates it because her best
friend's a hippie and she was like,
[SPEAKER_05]: fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give them that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out hippie friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, hey.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I said I was going to find a
cannabinoid chart, found this little cool
[SPEAKER_02]: pie chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got an Apple computer,
it looks like that fucking thing that
[SPEAKER_02]: spins around every time you use iTunes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a pie chart kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: You graduate from East high school.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't know, but we know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So CBD takes over more than half of the
pizza pie here and the symptoms that CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: can benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even pronounce some of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anti-psychotic, anti-epileptic,
neuro-protective, anti-spasmotic,
[SPEAKER_02]: anti-isemic, anti-cancer, anti-emetic,
anti-bacterial, anti-diabetic,
[SPEAKER_02]: anti-sporadic, analgesic, bone stimulant,
anti-inflammatory, T cell increase,
[SPEAKER_02]: immunosuppressive, adenosine uptake.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are other words that I honestly,
I'm not even going to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job on the adenosine uptake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only CBD, CBDV specifically points to bone
stimulant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Delta-9-THCA, anti-proliferative,
anti-spasmodic.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one that unfortunately the text is
the same color as the piece of the pie
[SPEAKER_02]: chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will never know which article or
molecule that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think if I highlight it with my mice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that type of a page.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice try though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I got to fucking figure out how to
zoom out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got the minus.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBG.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never known what CBG was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anti-microbial, bone stimulant,
analgesic, and anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm thinking anti-microbial.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got some mold infection in your
lungs, start smoking some CBG heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: The anti-inflammatory is if you turn that,
if you believe in the analgesic,
[SPEAKER_05]: like they said, like you could rub on
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you could rub like if you believe in
the rubs, I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you believe in the rubs?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not what I'm aiming for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a pothead and a dad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that if you believe they work,
they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to tell anybody that it
doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get anything from it because I
smoke too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBG is a bone stimulant, antibacterial,
anti-proliferative.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's a line coming off of
Delta 9 THCV and CBG that I think is
[SPEAKER_02]: anti-epileptic that is both of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bone stimulant for the Delta 9 THCV,
anorectic.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anorectic.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when you can't get an erection.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that's not what that is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are just a few from one little pie
chart from the different cannabinoids of
[SPEAKER_02]: what they benefit and how they can help
you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this came from trends in
pharmaceutical, it's really tall,
[SPEAKER_02]: small print, pharmacological sciences.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's more printed that I can't even
read, but that's where this little chart
[SPEAKER_02]: comes from.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we tweet that out on the iGrowCulture,
maybe a link to that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a better one in my phone that
I'll tweet, but I didn't want to dig for
[SPEAKER_02]: that one in my phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks really shitty to be on the phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it encourages you assholes to get on
the phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's mainly what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to get more people to your
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come Twitter my Twitter page at
iGrowCulture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for following me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, that was really awesome from Wade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry to pry too much into your pops.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of got all TMZ on you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't mind, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, no, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had something good to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, I don't know that I have anything
good to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say I go up without that
anxiety.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that if I did have that,
I wouldn't be doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm glad that that's working for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you nice and calm before you perform?
[SPEAKER_03]: I get really nervous up until I hit the
stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once I'm there, it's just,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm already here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're already up in front of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have a background in acting as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not good acting.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of theater.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep your clothes on?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, I can't seem to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but I have like just short films and
then a little bit of stage time on theater
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, being a front man for a
metal band.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I never had a problem getting up in
front of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hardest part is getting started.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like almost anything in life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Saying that first joke in front of
somebody has got to be an avalanche as
[SPEAKER_02]: that happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a friend do it last night,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was pacing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he listens to this show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give him a shout out.
[SPEAKER_05]: He went for his very first time last night
and watching him do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He did not want to smoke weed before and
he didn't drink before.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's very professional.
[SPEAKER_05]: But immediately after he finished,
he was like, give me that motherfucking J.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he did, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he crushed.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, he did great.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did absolutely great.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is something where if I was having
those symptoms, that would be something
[SPEAKER_03]: that I'm glad that this helps you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's not something that I feel
like I need, but I wonder how it would
[SPEAKER_03]: affect me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to find out because it's not
something I need to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've already been addicted to far too many
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Prozac, Wellbutrin, alcohol.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was fucking drunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wellbutrin is the one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a little bit what it's for.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like Prozac.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an antidepressant.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like you were saying earlier,
I don't like anything controlling me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like anything changing me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to be Clint Stewart.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I'm a fucking asshole, that's how
it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to be able to change me,
not a pill changing me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So alcohol, cigarettes, two
antidepressants, and all at the same time,
[SPEAKER_03]: unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've given all those up except for the
nicotine out of a vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: That thing's the size of a small baseball
bat.
[SPEAKER_03]: John Bueno put it best.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little robot dick.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're sucking the hell out of that little
robot dick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'd suck the shit out of this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're into our second podcast of the
night.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on another podcast with my friend Wade
that's sitting over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called 719 the Block.
[SPEAKER_02]: So listen to that if you'd like to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shameless plug.
[SPEAKER_02]: But through the course of two podcasts,
Wade has killed a pen and completely
[SPEAKER_02]: turned a paper blue and white.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, you are going at it over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the concentration thing, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it really... You're tearing it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: It helps.
[SPEAKER_02]: That paper is going to be all... Your
whole hand is going to be blue on the
[SPEAKER_02]: bottom side right there by the time you're
done.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to put the show back on track.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got time for a couple of questions,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: We bring Clint on to do a little bit of
Cannabis 101.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quickly scramble through your phone and
find a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So class is in session.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shoot me a question, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll try to answer it for the noobs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm glad we went over THC levels
because that was one of the questions I
[SPEAKER_03]: had.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something that I don't think a lot
of people know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I asked it last time,
but with THC levels for a newcomer,
[SPEAKER_03]: what levels would they be looking at?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that something they do at dispensaries?
[SPEAKER_03]: Look it, Clint's never even walked into a
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they have THC levels on the... Some of
the shops will have the THC level printed.
[SPEAKER_02]: The higher class places will, but it's
expensive to get the test done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them, unfortunately, will put a
higher level to mislead you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Side question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you believe that there will be a future
regulation of marijuana?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're already trying to outlaw... In
Amsterdam, you can't have cannabis over 15
[SPEAKER_02]: or 17% on the shelves in the coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, they're doing it like booze,
huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing it like that, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, shoot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it'll come to that here in
the States.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are trying to ban dabs in California,
from what I just read.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trying to ban everything in
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that does, you know what happens when
you fucking outlaw shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even need to go into prohibitions
sort of speeches.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you go into the shops, a lot of times
they do have the THC content listed on the
[SPEAKER_02]: strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, they'll grow one strain for
a year and they get one batch tested and
[SPEAKER_02]: they claim that it's that THC percent the
whole time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the future, we will be required to test
everything that's on every shelf that goes
[SPEAKER_02]: out of every door at every dispensary.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty much how it should be a
little bit though, shouldn't it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if we have to put ingredients on
like... Everything but cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and we don't want to be classified
as cigarettes, honestly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you're new, I say we very
loosely because I know I'm not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey man, you're a part of the community.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I am supporting it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't want anything to people to
think, oh, it's like cigarettes because
[SPEAKER_03]: they don't have this regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would rather we had the regulation on
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like the way that they said,
treat it like alcohol and the regulations
[SPEAKER_02]: because that made it feel skeezy to me,
but it did work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It did work, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was a proponent of saying it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're going to treat it like anything,
treat it like alcohol.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then after like 16 months of smoking,
it's the complete wrong mentality to take
[SPEAKER_05]: towards it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to write myself a note
because I want to talk more about this,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you guys kind of put me off on
something I wanted to kind of sidebar on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you go into the dispensary,
anything is going to be... If it's
[SPEAKER_02]: well-grown, you're going to hit 15,
17% THC, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like at the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're lucky, you're going to find a
22.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not super far apart,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen both.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've smoked both and it's very minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also the lab that tested it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some labs you can kind of, if you buddy up
and build a relationship, your numbers
[SPEAKER_02]: seem to go higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's some labs I know will not do
that because they have high integrity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a noob, like two or three good
hits off of a bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you're a smoker, if it's your
friend, first time one or two good hits
[SPEAKER_02]: off of a bowl of 20% THC weed,
we'll get you stoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll get red-eyed and cotton mouth two
or three good hits and you'll be like
[SPEAKER_02]: sucked to the couch for a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just start with one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Start with anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just start with one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be the people that buy an entire
fucking TKO bar and an eighth and then go
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke a bowl and then eat the fucking TKO
bar and then do something dumb and make us
[SPEAKER_02]: all...
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to try one of those.
[SPEAKER_05]: The TKO bars are... I haven't tried too
many of the brand name edibles.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess you can say just because I would
rather spend my money on the flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess you could say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was the TKO one of... I know you talked
about this on a previous podcast,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe two or three.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tested those and I would fucking
testify that that shit works.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will also testify that it works on Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he hung out with me that night.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was on point that night, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about the... Before I even mentioned
the name brand, I bought us a coat.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went... Wade and I went and saw Anthony
Jezzle naked comedy works and I bought us
[SPEAKER_02]: each a cookie at a dispensary at a
recreational shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: How'd you feel about that 100 milligram
cookie?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it kicked in after the show and I
fell asleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: You did fall asleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were kind of talking in your sleep and
a little twitchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the growing kitchen.
[SPEAKER_02]: That cookie was on point.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tasted good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was moist and the THC was there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I judge edibles a lot by the over
marijuana taste.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're going to be a pro at it and
you're going to sell marijuana in packages
[SPEAKER_05]: and everything like that, you should be
able to get that big weedy taste out of
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: In your edibles.
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: It shouldn't taste like weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: So great product, great little product,
not overly weedy taste.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was high throughout the show,
but then when we redabbed up after the
[SPEAKER_05]: show, I was fucking done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you know why I get so wrecked when I
eat edibles and then take dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You feel like you're floating already on
an edible and then you take a dab and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: sky red.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't really done that yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's hilarious when you do though.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you took that TKO bar, you went up to
Denver to handle some business.
[SPEAKER_05]: You took a TKO bar coming back down.
[SPEAKER_05]: We recorded a podcast that night and your
eyes were open like, man, you were like
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking preaching some fire and it was
hilarious.
[SPEAKER_05]: I might've been lit up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Real quick, real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what you're saying is that you don't
feel like the cookie kicked in during the
[SPEAKER_03]: show or you said you were high throughout
the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: You were high throughout the show on the
cookie and then once you hit the dab,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was like, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or were you guys smoking?
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess my real question is how long did
it take for the cookie to kick in or do
[SPEAKER_03]: you not?
[SPEAKER_05]: Over an hour easily.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, it's like about an hour and a
half.
[SPEAKER_03]: And seeing that's something I'm trying to
get at is if it's not going to work
[SPEAKER_03]: immediately, don't just take more and
expect it to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of my main focuses is people to
not overdo something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here for me, it's like, so this is where
like when dabs come in for me,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's just like whenever I take a dab,
like a big dab, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: When Jeff puts a man dab up in front of
me, the only thing I think in my head,
[SPEAKER_05]: which I know is impossible and I would
just like to preface this by saying that,
[SPEAKER_05]: but the only thing that goes on in my head
is this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't want to be the first person
to die from weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to be that dude that's like,
well, Wade Ridley died from marijuana and
[SPEAKER_05]: now everyone is fucked because I couldn't
handle my shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You won't be the match.com killer anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'll be the weed killer even better.
[SPEAKER_05]: The one who killed everybody's high,
not just a couple of women.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took a dab earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: A nice sized dab off of a new rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, shout out to Micron Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I said that, but I took a
dab off my new rig and I heard the ice
[SPEAKER_02]: cream truck and there was no fucking ice
cream truck.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's such a big dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 11 o'clock at night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's that ice cream truck?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard it, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, it was all in my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was vivid.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you sure you're not having PTSD
motherfucker?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I was a fat kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So trying to chase that fucker down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew he just sped up and looked at the
rear view and laughed at me until he got
[SPEAKER_02]: to the corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend Joey went to a dispensary today.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend Joey is a medical marijuana
patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't have any medical marijuana in
the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, they had plenty of recreational
marijuana, which is about 25% more in
[SPEAKER_02]: regular price just off the shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus another 25% tax.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why would they be out of medical?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I haven't had time to research it,
I got this text message as we were sitting
[SPEAKER_02]: down to record our first podcast today and
I haven't had a time anytime to look at
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys, anybody listening has
experienced this, if you're a medical
[SPEAKER_02]: patient and your medical marijuana center
doesn't have cannabis for you as a medical
[SPEAKER_02]: patient, but they do have rec weed,
let's talk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me how you feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tweet me at igrowculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will speak your voice on the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't say your name.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't want, you can send me a
private message.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get it on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to fucking talk about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't legalize cannabis to abandon the
people that got our foot in the door.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's what they'll say is it's free
market.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's free market.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, but it's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not compassionate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's disrespectful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate it so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, if you keep punching me in the eye
and I don't say, dude, quit fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: punching me in the eye, you'll keep doing
it all day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody's got to say, quit fucking
punching the patients in the eye because
[SPEAKER_02]: they're the ones that got this going.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the ones that need this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody's got to be responsible and I can
do what I could do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a big mouth and I've got a podcast
tweet and people listen and we can try to
[SPEAKER_02]: figure out what we can do to prevent it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the patients are the ones that got
us going, dude, but definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no, that's a more than accurate
statement.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say medical marijuana was ... When
I lived in New Orleans, medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_05]: was active here.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I moved back, it's recreational and
legal for everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like it was recreational first
and then marijuana second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people had to put in a lot of
work to get it where it is and we're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to fucking those people now and it sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even think about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's happening to people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, you know what you guys should do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sunday is Mother's Day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get your mom some weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw a post today.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's graduation time in Boulder and I saw
a post that said the dispensaries are
[SPEAKER_02]: busier today than they were during 420
because all the moms and pops need to get
[SPEAKER_02]: some weed for graduation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finals are over too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finals are over.
[SPEAKER_05]: Finals are done so it's like, fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: What can I get you, mom?
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going into that fucking store,
okay?
[SPEAKER_05]: You're getting me an eighth of the
stickiest of the ickiest and you're
[SPEAKER_05]: driving home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't pinch my sack, bitch.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't you fucking touch that thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, dude, I'll give you one more
question if you got a good one on the
[SPEAKER_03]: phone screen there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know electricity bills for growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that not everybody is an outdoor
grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked to some guys that last time we
talked to a guy that was an outdoor
[SPEAKER_03]: grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering, per plant, how many lights
are you using?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is it one light for four plants?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's common?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying to get into your business
exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a personal preference how
many lights per plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most larger grows will be 1,000 watt
light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually, if you got a bedroom,
I've seen guys doing two and a bedroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some guys got four in a bedroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's usually your average residential
grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: No more than four lights or so in a house.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're doing an industrial thing,
then you need what's called phase three
[SPEAKER_02]: electrical.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're an industrial guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm talking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little more power availability.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just going from 120 volts to 240.
[SPEAKER_03]: 240.
240.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of just being a single phase line
power going in, it's three phases.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of jargon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but it's able to harness a lot more
power without being a fire hazard
[SPEAKER_05]: essentially.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what also that is?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the most intelligent sentence I've
ever heard you put together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to let him have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, man, he is fluent in speech
when it comes to some power.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I went to school for electrical,
I was going to do solar powered stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back when it was not ridiculously
expensive, before Vestas came in,
[SPEAKER_03]: this was a while ago, before all the solar
power stuff was going on, I thought,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is the field I want to get into.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to school for electronics and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually have a minor understanding of
what's going on with that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying I know a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, the prices of solar panels
and wind turbines and stuff like that just
[SPEAKER_03]: skyrocketed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Windmills and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's far too expensive to get in and have
a profit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or save any money within the next 10
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something that I wish there was a
cheaper alternative to those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I carry around a book, Solar Energy for
Dummies.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in my backpack.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always on me because I think that's
an amazing industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish that it was more prevalent because
fuck you, Black Hills.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a dispensary downtown.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we were the only dispensary downtown
for a while and they shut us down.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were running quite a few lights in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were easily 20 grow lights in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get back to what your
question was.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were easily 20 grow lights in there
plus a more veg light area and then
[SPEAKER_02]: another downstairs area and then plus the
dispensary business area.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had so much solar on the building on
the roof that our bill was negative.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were getting money back from the
company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's fucking shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to be a dispensary to have that
type of funding.
[SPEAKER_02]: That building was actually a health food
store before our dispensary took it over.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a lot too.
[SPEAKER_02]: They started it and we finished funding
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're running a residential grow,
what I've seen from a caregiver grow,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to average about $100 per
thousand watt light per month on your
[SPEAKER_02]: electric bill because the light is going
to run you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a couple of fans.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a blower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have a couple more
accessories that go with that that all
[SPEAKER_02]: need to plug in a timer for this and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be running about $100 per
light through a veg cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: $100 per month?
[SPEAKER_02]: Per month, per light.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, but from that one light,
if you do it right, you're going to get a
[SPEAKER_02]: pound of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do it correctly, there's one pound
of weed and depending where you are,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even want to talk market value.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Market value on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pure cocaine, Colombian.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say that to me about $3,032.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're talking shit about just about the
right numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anywhere from $25 to $35 depending on who
you are, what you grew, what you've got.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about what a pound is going to get
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that $100 of electricity, if you do it
right, hopefully you spent about $100 in
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients, like another $100 on supplies,
maybe $100 on dirt, just maybe $200 on
[SPEAKER_02]: dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just guessing off the top of my head
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully you are able to make that an
investment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully you're able to give a portion to
your patients that you're a caregiver for
[SPEAKER_02]: and take a portion for yourself to make
some hash out of and then maybe move
[SPEAKER_02]: enough of it to your patients when they
run out of their initial gift.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got to pay for the rest and that
covers the light bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully you can work it out that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you go pro, you can grow a pound and
a half, two pounds per light, but you just
[SPEAKER_02]: got to get good and have the right
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: That takes a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: The right nutrient mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why we're talking on the
genetics guy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Heart of gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Heart of gold harvests heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lemon Jeffrey harvests like a champ.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're looking for heavy harvesting,
heavy weight crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're almost in an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to kind of in the question and
we're going to do a couple more little
[SPEAKER_02]: quick things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remembered, dude, thanks for asking
those good questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to bring Clint back to all the
listeners because we didn't get enough
[SPEAKER_02]: questions and he's got a whole list of
questions in the phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you guys got questions,
please, I grow culture on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, he's good at advertising and
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once in a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just going to read something that
this is, I've got a forum.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also, I read genetics, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got, I read genetics, colorado.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go, I read genetics, colorado.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wrote this 10 months and two weeks ago
is what I believe it said.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to scroll up 10 months and two days
ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my point is that it's still relevant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a little bit of advice that I
decided to rant a while back.
[SPEAKER_02]: That says, I'm asked tons of questions
about growing ganja.
[SPEAKER_02]: My first piece of advice is to buy
yourself a good cannabis grow guide.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recommend something from Ed Rosenthal,
Jorge Cervantes, or Greg Green.
[SPEAKER_02]: A good grow guide will answer most of your
questions before they arise.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you will, if you take the time to read
the book before you start growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't just buy the book and set it by
the shitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to open it up and read it,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, I didn't type that, but that's how
I feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to open it and read that thing
from cover to cover before you even get
[SPEAKER_02]: your seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, now onto the reading.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my other biggest pieces of advice I
can ever share would be to think twice
[SPEAKER_02]: before you do anything new in your garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a bright idea to try something
new that you heard from a friend or read
[SPEAKER_02]: online, take the time to think it through
before you attempt it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone can post on the internet and claim
to have heavy or have stellar results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of those results will not only,
will only work in specific situations and
[SPEAKER_02]: will often lead to additional problems
down the line in your garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not discouraging you from
experimenting in your garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: I strongly encourage experimentation and
expanding your skills.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm encouraging responsible
experimentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You won't learn anything new unless you
try new things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be afraid to kill a plant or two,
but don't get reckless and kill an entire
[SPEAKER_02]: crop trying an idea you heard at the hydro
shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next time you get an idea in your
garden, you should think about a few
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is your goal?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the point of what you're
attempting?
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously and clearly, think about what
you're trying to make happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop making it more difficult than it
needs to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like something that I always tell
my friends that are growing weed and they
[SPEAKER_02]: have problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop making it more difficult than it
needs to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: This shit's a weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It grows in Afghanistan on the side of a
cliffy ass mountain in the wind and the
[SPEAKER_02]: rain and the sun and it's getting beat to
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Animals piss in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it grow, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is good weed if you do it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now onto my reading.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did you get this idea?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the idea from a reputable source or is
it a troll online who's never grown a
[SPEAKER_02]: plant but thinks he knows everything?
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind that most of the things you
do won't show results for two to five
[SPEAKER_02]: days.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can spray or feed some ridiculous shit
today and think everything is cool and
[SPEAKER_02]: then in a few days, boom, everything is
brown and pissed off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scissoring and pruning are not fixable if
you chop off something important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be mindful of what you're making happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every action has an equal and opposite
reaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants seem to remind us of this when we
try to get silly in the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you decide to try something new,
don't try it out on your whole crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Test an idea on a plant you have grown a
few times and you know exactly what to
[SPEAKER_02]: expect under your normal conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got all nasally in my headphones.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you like what you see, you can do your
new trick to the entire crop next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do things correctly, you'll be
running another crop in a few weeks and
[SPEAKER_02]: you can try new stuff again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't try everything new all at once.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make five changes and something
works.
[SPEAKER_02]: How will you know what made the buds grow
like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Try to make changes slowly.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I tune all five things, how do I know
which one made that bud get really huge
[SPEAKER_02]: and fat?
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you've thought about your idea twice
and considered the long-term effects,
[SPEAKER_02]: go smoke a fat joint and reconsider your
idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Read a cannabis grow guide from a
reputable author and see what they say
[SPEAKER_02]: about your idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you post your idea online, expect
varied replies and please don't take
[SPEAKER_02]: anyone too seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: After you've thought about the methods and
results of your idea twice, read a grow
[SPEAKER_02]: guide, smoke the joint, and reconsider
every detail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take very good notes of what you do and
follow your heart to reach your goals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take good notes because that's how we know
what we did, what worked, what didn't
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get reckless.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we're talking about learning new
stuff, that was my favorite piece of
[SPEAKER_02]: advice that I could come up with a long
time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to share that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was good, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to write a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have a creative side to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did mention I get some books.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be an ultimate segue
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go from this to some books.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned some books from Jorge
Cervantes or Ed Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm holding in my hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm reaching.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm lying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm reaching for Marijuana Horticulture,
the Indoor Outdoor Medical Growers Bible
[SPEAKER_02]: from Jorge Cervantes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been updated since I got this,
but I'll never let this one go.
[SPEAKER_02]: He signed the inside for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: This book, honestly, has gotten ... You
can tell by looking, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: This book has been through hell and has
gotten me ... This is probably a good 50%
[SPEAKER_02]: of my grow education right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the intro book right here if
you're going to grow some weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did Jorge Cervantes as our give.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks section last episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: This time we're going to do the author of
this book.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the Marijuana Grower's Handbook.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the official course book for
Oakstradam University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Between this book and the Marijuana
Horticulture Bible there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, you can't go wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the answers are in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a new problem that's not in
this book, we're fucked.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have to fucking find some
new shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the two books I recommend
everybody grab.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to put a picture of those up on
your Instagram?
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely plan on doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to steal the pictures off
of websites and just use those high
[SPEAKER_02]: quality shots instead of taking a photo.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to lead me into a section.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every episode we do here, it's called Give
Thanks, where we like to give thanks to
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody who has contributed heavily to
the cannabis movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I'm talking about Mr. Ed
Rosenthal, the author of the Marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: Grower's Handbook.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ed Rosenthal was born in the Bronx,
New York in 1948.
[SPEAKER_02]: This dude's an old cat.
[SPEAKER_02]: He got to see the revolution of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was there when having a joint was a
serious crime and now he's here where he
[SPEAKER_02]: comes to Colorado and comes to all the
parties and takes dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think he dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: He smokes joints with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: He comes and gets down now.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a California horticulturalist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can say that word when I'm not reading
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Horticulturalist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still fucked it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, he's one of those guys,
an author, publisher, and a cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: grower known for his advocacy in the legal
ization of marijuana use.
[SPEAKER_02]: He served as a columnist for High Times
Magazine during the 80s and 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was arrested in 2002 for cultivation of
cannabis by federal authorities who do not
[SPEAKER_02]: recognize authority of states to regulate
the use of medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was convicted in federal court,
but the conviction was overturned on
[SPEAKER_02]: appeal.
Yay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rosenthal was subsequently convicted
again, but was not re-sentenced since his
[SPEAKER_02]: original sentence had been completed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rosenthal briefly attended Youngstown
State University in Youngstown,
[SPEAKER_02]: Ohio.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smart as fuck to go there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rosenthal has been active in promoting and
developing policies and civil regulation
[SPEAKER_02]: for medical marijuana with the passage of
California's pioneering proposition 215 in
[SPEAKER_02]: 1996, which authorizes medicinal use of
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: He worked with the state and local
governments to implement the delivery of
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmaceutical grade cannabis to patients
with the doctor's recommendation to use
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's also the author of numerous books
about the cultivation of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wrote, like I said, one of the most
essential books that I've got in my book
[SPEAKER_02]: collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do another guide to this series.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to make a note to do the next
guy writing his name down.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is who's going to be next in our give
thanks portion.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, another author that you got to
read who will be next.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ed wrote some important books.
[SPEAKER_02]: He also comes to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes all over the country, all over the
world and does seminars and expos and
[SPEAKER_02]: teaches people about growing weed and the
benefits of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got to give big thanks to Mr. Ed
Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much respect, much love.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep doing it, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've taught me a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You continue to teach people a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's at Oakster Dam all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he's still involved with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can learn a lot from that,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Read his books, read his books.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, go buy his book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Read a book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wade's looking at me like I'm going to
sing the whole read a book song.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys know the read a book song,
that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have to Google that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny once.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny once.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, guys, we're right about an hour
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a good time to wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys want to do some plugs?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do we find Mr. At Tall Clint on the
social media?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my Twitter handle there.
[SPEAKER_03]: At Tall Clint on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can find me there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on Twitter a bit.

[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So coming up in this episode, we got a
little grow lesson from my buddy,
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse, and we're also hanging out with my
hash buddy, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing today, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing pretty good, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You?
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that we got this recording figured
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a little difficult this evening,
but technology does that sometimes,
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure it's the technology's fault.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be the dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dabs and the phase two rig and the
torch combination.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to blame it on technology
because everyone has a lot of problems
[SPEAKER_04]: with technology all the time, so it's
common.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's much more common.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not so rare.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're notable dabbers, so I don't
really want to admit like so much
[SPEAKER_04]: retardedness from dabbing right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might be dab-tarded.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to call myself a professional.
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your week been, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been eventful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any events you'd like to share with us?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not at the moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't spill any beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Kev's got some really cool shit
coming up in the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: The last couple days have been exciting,
and I'm excited to have it happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll announce that stuff when the time
comes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hard work pays off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hard work and dedication.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just get it done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a pretty eventful week myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to hang out with this guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does comedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: His name's Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was in Denver twice.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was there Sunday, and he was also there
Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was Sunday and Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where did he go Monday?
[SPEAKER_02]: He went to Omaha, Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he went and came back?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they booked the show for Sunday
night.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to tell everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does a tradition of Mother's Day at
ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every Mother's Day is Sunday every year,
and so he does that Sunday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, kind of.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it kind of sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Mother's Day.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should be at home with our moms,
and I got to go to Denver and see Doug
[SPEAKER_02]: Benson.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's worth it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I go up there, and I took my good buddy
Wade.
[SPEAKER_02]: On Mother's Day, we went up there,
and we saw Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, he came after the show and
smoked out with Wade and myself and a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple other people that happened to be
diehards of Wade.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, that guy's a really cool,
normal, down-to-earth guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then he said that the reason he had to
go do ... He did Monday, or he did Sunday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, he did Monday in another state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tuesdays, because he booked the show,
and then ComedyWorks saw how well it sold
[SPEAKER_02]: and asked him to do something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then Tuesday night was actually the
taping of Doug Love's movies, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: probably my favorite podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a toss-up.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a couple that can qualify.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so I got to go see the taping of
one of my favorite podcasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once again, a lot of people
really ... They didn't think he was going
[SPEAKER_02]: to come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were really ... I can't think of the
word.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were not believers that he was going
to show up and come out and smoke with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skeptical.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were skeptics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he came out, and he puffed a big fat
joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just him and I, dude, hanging out
behind ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's dope.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave him an iReGenetics t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if anybody sees Doug Benson wearing
that iReGenetics t-shirt, please ... Take
[SPEAKER_02]: a picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Send it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will hook you up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll send you a sticker or something for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're the first person to send me a
picture of Doug Benson in my shirt,
[SPEAKER_02]: don't go Photoshopping that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see a real picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kev worked in a print shop for many years,
so he'll be able to spot your
[SPEAKER_02]: Photoshopping-ness if that happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom.
Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's enough ranting and bragging.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to hang out with Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty damn awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we both had a pretty nice week.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty positive week going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bringing the iReVibes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I read something weird in the news today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Minnesota passes concentrate-only medical
marijuana bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I tell you about this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Concentrate-only?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll read the article, and then we'll talk
about it for a second here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll read it for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: Governor Mark Dayton announced he'll sign
the bill into law even before this
[SPEAKER_02]: afternoon's press conference even began.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, he announced that he would before the
conference began.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, there's a lot of, I should have
stopped on a lot of things here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, loose-leaf cannabis made me chuckle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we call that flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actual cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are going to be alternative care
centers around the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think what you're going to be able
to do is medicate there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they're, because they're not
going to give you any flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't sound like, does it?
[SPEAKER_04]: But it concentrates, so I think they'll
probably sell concentrates.
[SPEAKER_04]: But does that mean, because isn't dabbing
vaporizing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of is.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's how you smoke oils is you
vaporize them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another stupid thing, PTSD isn't
included as a qualifying condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's freaking retarded.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's, first of all,
there's evidence.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess you can't prove if it's helping
your PTSD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you can if you're a psychologist.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have patients that come into my shop
that are former, uh, military veterans and
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they, man, does it help them and their
quality of life and their family's quality
[SPEAKER_04]: of life because of what the PTSD does.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other option is, uh, what they do
if they don't have cannabis is they drink
[SPEAKER_02]: alcohol and that's never good for
anybody's family.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've actually had one patient that I cured
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: From an alcohol addiction for many,
many years and he hasn't, he keeps coming
[SPEAKER_04]: back and hasn't used alcohol since he came
in the first time.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first time he came in, he didn't know
anything about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something that, uh, really is weird
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There, whoever, who pushed this bill,
who set this up to get past this way?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a failure in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, uh, uh, it's a compromise.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a perfect process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, you just signed up for bullshit that
kind of cock blocked any of the stuff that
[SPEAKER_02]: would have been useful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying that edibles and,
uh, capsules and concentrates are not the
[SPEAKER_02]: way to go, but the main, the way we
discovered the effectiveness of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: the best way to consume the natural way,
the real way is to just smoke raw.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's been done for thousands of
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and we need that to make anything
else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need that quality flower and that
research and that, that everything's still
[SPEAKER_04]: being done on, on, on the plant because we
need that plant to its full potential to
[SPEAKER_04]: be able to make the concentrated medicine.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wonder how, I wonder who's going to
be making the concentrates for these guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: The strictest regulations in the medical
marijuana game.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't heard anything about this yet,
but we'll see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we'll see what comes out of there and
what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys are in states that are
proposing medical marijuana regulations,
[SPEAKER_02]: don't settle for stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can, you can language your bills.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your proposed bills can be languaged in
the way that work for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be smart about it and make sure that you
are able to consume raw loose leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: material and flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you enable yourself to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure that each person is allowed to
grow cannabis when you're, when you're,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're the persons that are involved in
writing these bills and proposing this,
[SPEAKER_02]: if that's your responsibility,
make sure you're able to grow,
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure there's access and please stop
the CBD only treatments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've ranted about that before,
but if you're one of the people that's
[SPEAKER_04]: helping, I keep telling all kinds of
people that come in from other states that
[SPEAKER_04]: they're talking about the CBD only stuff
that's going on wherever they're from or
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: I let them know that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not not the way to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need this whole plan.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not one specific chemical that does
this thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the combination of, of what's in the
plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes CBD is the way to go for some
folks, but man, I believe it's higher CBD,
[SPEAKER_02]: not just CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the entourage needs.
[SPEAKER_04]: It needs the mix of everything else to
work correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sanjay Gupta, I think is who will coined
the phrase, the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if that was him, but that's
all the cannabinoids working together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I'm going to move on because we
could go about that one all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of an old piece of news here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's actually from today.
[SPEAKER_02]: State approved marijuana testing labs in
Colorado can't accept private pot samples.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Luckily, I am part of a facility where I'm
able to get my stuff tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it helps me search for phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It helps me decide what I need for each
patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, the average citizen cannot
go and get his stuff tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll read it to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado medical and retail marijuana
testing labs licensed by the marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: enforcement division can no longer accept
and test private samples dropped off by
[SPEAKER_02]: patients and caregivers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Legally, they're only allowed to test
marijuana from state licensed marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: For new listeners, the marijuana
enforcement division is the group we talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are in charge of their exactly what
they sound like the enforcement division.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're able to show up at your dispensary
and inspect everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are attached to the IRS.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are seriously involved with all of
the medical marijuana, the recreational
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana business.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are heavily regulating all of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So officials say the move keeps the state
out of the federal government's crosshairs
[SPEAKER_02]: by maintaining a tight lock on marijuana
inventory.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it also punishes home growing patients
who want to know what they're putting in
[SPEAKER_02]: their bodies and prevents objective third
party tests from being conducted on
[SPEAKER_02]: products currently for sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what they're saying is I'm a caregiver
and Kevin's my patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got another patient that would really
like some super high CBD medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have one strain that I work with
that's really super high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got another one coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just finding the keeper.
[SPEAKER_02]: If Kevin, if I weren't growing with a
dispensary or involved with dispensaries
[SPEAKER_02]: and had those shops growing my products,
growing my seed packs, I wouldn't be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to get these things tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: If Kevin were his own caregiver,
he wouldn't be able to take his medicine
[SPEAKER_02]: to these places and have it tested to find
the high CBD strain that he needs or the
[SPEAKER_02]: high THC strain that he needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's who it should be all about.
[SPEAKER_02]: As the patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're kind of screwing the caregiver
over on this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you just got to grow a bunch of weed
and smoke it and find what works for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what works instead of being
able to just, you know, take a nug off of
[SPEAKER_04]: each of your plant and take a gram and go
have each one tested and know what's going
[SPEAKER_04]: to work for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another thing that we can't do,
we can't test for molds or pesticides or
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogens or any type of heavy metals or
contaminants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have faith in my growing, but wouldn't
you like to know once in a while?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's how, you know, if you're
doing right, just take a sample to the lab
[SPEAKER_02]: and luckily I can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got a bunch of stuff tested and I
hate to brag, but I hit pretty freaking
[SPEAKER_02]: awesome numbers and zero contaminants,
pathogens, problems, pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: So luckily I'm hooked up like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: According to the MED, the rule hasn't been
in effect since October 15th of 2013,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it wasn't being followed, at least not
so strictly that the Denver Post wasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: able to get independent tests done on
edibles as recently as March through Steep
[SPEAKER_02]: Hill Halent, an MED licensed lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: DOR officials, that's Department of
Revenue officials, haven't admitted that
[SPEAKER_02]: those tests, which showed an embarrassing
lack of oversight on behalf of the MED,
[SPEAKER_02]: spurred the sudden enforcement of the rule
and announcement of the change.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the timing is curious and brings up
another point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Westward and the Post, as well as many
other, as any other media outlet,
[SPEAKER_02]: will no longer be able to do our own
independent tests at state verified
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to recap.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of episodes ago we talked about
the Westward bought edibles from
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensaries and took them two labs to be
tested and we found out that there's some
[SPEAKER_02]: bullshit going on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now with these new rules, maybe those
tests reminded the regulators that this
[SPEAKER_02]: rule is in place and they forgot,
nobody's enforcing it, so we think we kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of got their attention by maybe putting it
in the paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then also now we can't do that
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: A normal guy like you and I, if we get an
edible and we were like, this one's crap
[SPEAKER_02]: and we save half of it, we can't take it
down to the testing lab and say,
[SPEAKER_02]: test this for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've kind of been blocked out,
which I don't think is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's another thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're setting up legalization in your
state, make sure that the testing is
[SPEAKER_02]: available for anybody, not just state
licensed facilities, because not everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: can afford the state licensing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everybody needs to be state licensed.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as you're a caregiver,
I think you should have the right to get
[SPEAKER_02]: your stuff tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I'm going to see if I got
another news topic in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Read one more news topic and then we'll
get into, my good buddy Jesse came over a
[SPEAKER_02]: little earlier and we recorded some stuff
about outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this may be a little bit old to some of
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to talk about it on the show,
but we've been so busy that I had a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: news going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this week, there ain't shit in the
weed news.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of a good thing because it let us get
to the grow episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, house bill $13,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: $13,061, which limits hash sales and house
bill $13,066, which further regulate
[SPEAKER_02]: edible sales were approved by the state
Senate on the third reading yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I head to the governor's desk for
signing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there is an update.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's the update, the original post.
[SPEAKER_02]: I read that kind of backwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you what they're signing.
[SPEAKER_02]: A bill limiting how much marijuana
concentrate can be sold to in-state and
[SPEAKER_02]: out-of-state residents who are age 21 and
older, as well as legislation placing new
[SPEAKER_02]: rules on marijuana edibles appear on track
to become state law as lawmakers try to
[SPEAKER_02]: wrap up a 2014 session loaded with weed
bills by Wednesday afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn, that was a mouthful of words.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take a drink of some coconut
water here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me one second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quick second, taking a drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to coconut water, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you buy the coconut water, do not get
one with lemon in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of tasty flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's mango, there's pineapple,
there's citrusy, ones don't get the one
[SPEAKER_02]: with the lemon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to try it once.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really ever drink coconut water.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really know what that's about,
but it's good for you, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tastiness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it water from a coconut?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's water from a coconut.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty much the package says it's
like sticking a straw on a coconut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the ones with some fruit juice in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're new, it'll kind of be different.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time you try it, you won't be
ready for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a big plug for coconut water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Word.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: House bill $13,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: It passed on a second reading in the state
Senate yesterday without any amendments.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a result, the bill could have its third
reading as early as today.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we pointed out last month, the bill's
wording doesn't seem to make it clear
[SPEAKER_02]: whether the DOR is meant to measure the
total THC in an ounce or the total amount
[SPEAKER_02]: of hash or concentrate that can be
produced from an ounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Neither does the legislation address the
potency of the flowers to be tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever the final interpretation,
the net effect adds up to the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Consumers will no longer be able to walk
out of a shop with 28 grams of hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Far fewer than that problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of state consumers who are already
limited to a quarter ounce of herb at a
[SPEAKER_02]: time will be limited to a quarter ounce of
herbs equivalent in hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are they going to regulate that,
bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: About a gram.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll probably limit it to a gram.
[SPEAKER_04]: You think that'll be it?
[SPEAKER_04]: For out of state.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll probably say a gram for out of
state.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'll probably do an eighth for in
state.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe up to a quarter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Depends on what ...
[SPEAKER_04]: They may do five grams.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't say?
[SPEAKER_02]: They haven't decided.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't even know how to decide yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: How is a bill being passed when they don't
have it written or the law?
[SPEAKER_02]: The next line says it's likely that the
DOR will create a working group later this
[SPEAKER_02]: year to iron out details, as the
department has done with marijuana-centric
[SPEAKER_02]: legislation in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to go about it backwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, again.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to play backwards.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every fucking three months, there's going
to be new regulation and new regulation,
[SPEAKER_04]: and everyone's going to get audited and
fucked with just because they can't figure
[SPEAKER_04]: out what ... Look, dude, off of good nugs,
you can get fucking 25%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Average it to 20 off of a nug run.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put it on 10 as a trim run.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got seven grams.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's about 0.7 grams.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you got a nug run, that's about 1.4,
so you average it out one gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever seen any of the legislators
think like that?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but ask some of us in the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: They try, but they don't seem to forget
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Try to listen to some people that ... For
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a hash maker.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to limit it to the same thing
as buying an ounce, whatever that makes
[SPEAKER_04]: and concentrate, pick an average number,
and that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pick one that's in the middle of the low
end and the high end, and go with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice round number.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They should just take ... They should make
a tube that holds perfectly an ounce,
[SPEAKER_02]: and just blast that into containers,
and there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your one ounce worth of
concentrates for sale at the price of an
[SPEAKER_02]: ounce a week.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little to-go portion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just being a smart ass here.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a related measure, House Bill 1366,
which would ban edible manufacturers from
[SPEAKER_02]: making pot-infused foods that,
and in quotes, a reasonable consumer would
[SPEAKER_02]: confuse with a trademark food product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so that means that the Reifers and
the KifKat, those are now banned in
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also looks like it will become law.
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition, the bill prohibits edible
makers from making pot foods that are
[SPEAKER_02]: primarily marketed to children.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry that I shouted out Reifers and
KifKat, but those were the obvious ones
[SPEAKER_02]: that I thought of.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mean to point you out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep your recipe the same, and shape
everything like a weed leaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then it can't be confused.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, yep, yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the bill would require more stringent
packaging and labeling from the marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bill's authors say the moves are
needed to protect children, while
[SPEAKER_02]: advocates have said the language is so
vague that it might even prevent them from
[SPEAKER_02]: making marijuana cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: The State Marijuana Enforcement Division
is also working on limiting the potency of
[SPEAKER_02]: edibles, and is also discussing a labeling
system.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're still having a fucking ... I
thought they already hashed out labeling.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of change it again, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, because they're going to
change potency guidelines again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, but you change the number on
the fucking potency.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to rearrange all the
packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: That kind of relates to something we
talked about a couple of days ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are we going to measure the potency of
these edibles if the labs can't get their
[SPEAKER_02]: shit together and kind of agree on a
standard of how they're going to test?
[SPEAKER_02]: They all do different tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we took one candy bar to another lab
and one to another, it'll be different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's why not very many labs are
licensed to do that right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very true.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why it's very limited, and that's
why there's back orders on fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: products, because there's only a couple of
fucking places to get tested, and all
[SPEAKER_04]: these companies have to send all of their
stuff to get tested there and wait for the
[SPEAKER_04]: results.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's hundreds of companies in Colorado
have to do that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even think of that many
companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I posted something on Facebook just
out of curiosity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, how much does a bag of herb cost
where you live?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you pay for an eighth,
a quarter, or an ounce?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the quality?
[SPEAKER_02]: What country do you live in?
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have put state.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put what country.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: What state or country do you live in?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is cannabis legal in your area?
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I said that I'm gathering info for a
podcast, so I'm scrolling down.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_02]: You must know somebody.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says it's legal, but dispensaries are
banned in my county, so caregivers only.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good caregiver there, hooking up 25 an
eighth, 175 an ounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ventura County, 140 an ounce for legal
medical use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some good indoor, tons of great quality
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some answers that I think might be
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: People just trying to brag.
[SPEAKER_02]: They keep passing.
[SPEAKER_02]: One guy said standard street prices.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm asking.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are standard street prices,
bro?
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wherever you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Illinois passed medical, but it's going to
take some time before many people can even
[SPEAKER_02]: get their license.
[SPEAKER_02]: Multiple doctor visits at cost,
and there are no dispensaries in this
[SPEAKER_02]: state as of yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you do have your medical
marijuana, you can't get any weed anywhere
[SPEAKER_02]: in Illinois, it looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy says $10 grams, $30 an eighth,
$150 ounces in Bakersfield.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're the only county in Cali where they
voted to ban dispensaries, and there's
[SPEAKER_02]: about 30 now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flint, Michigan, wholesale, $200 an ounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Retail, $325 an ounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy wrote retail and wholesale
prices.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like retail for a quarter is 50.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't do it all in the same order,
so I got to figure out which one he meant,
[SPEAKER_02]: but $30 an eighth for top shelf in Flint,
Michigan is what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon, you're looking at $40 an eighth,
$90 a quarter for grade AAA weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe you there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Detroit area, $250 an ounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy says he's in Stanwood,
Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking at flowers, $10 to $15 a
gram here, concentrates $20 to $60 a gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gives a shout out to a place where he
works, and then says thank you Kim.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're this guy's freaking collective
employer, thank you Kim.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool of you keeping this guy
supplied with medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Philly area, $50 to $60 an eighth,
$100 to $120 a quarter, $300 to $375 for
[SPEAKER_02]: an ounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never much of a selection, but not bad
either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like prices are varying a little bit
from $200 to $350.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this guy, South Carolina, $350 to $500
an ounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quality of subpar, not legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Geez, come out to Colorado, you can pay
that and get some dangity-dank and fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: be legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: At a medical shop, or at a rec shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you can come into a shop and get
fucking badassness for that price.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody just chimed in, around $230 an
ounce for B grade buds near Missoula,
[SPEAKER_02]: Montana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, somebody messaged me too, they didn't
want to post it on there, so we'll read,
[SPEAKER_02]: we got two private messages.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jacksonville, Florida, ounces of accurate
strain Cali in Colorado, ship flower,
[SPEAKER_02]: goes for $50, $100, $200, $350,
$1,100.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did he say ship flower?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so don't ship flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even gonna read the rest of your
stuff, because you're shipping stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talk about not doing that here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't fucking ship weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't ship any fucking weed products.
[SPEAKER_04]: God damn it, we've talked about it several
times, obviously you don't listen to
[SPEAKER_04]: podcasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, zips are $200 from the garden,
$250 from a friend, 10 plus from the
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what 10 means, 10 plus from
the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lower the price, the better the
quality in that order, bless.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it must mean like a grade 10 plus.
[SPEAKER_02]: People just have a hard time typing,
I think, sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I just wanted to share with you what
prices are of cannabis across the nation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now in Colorado, there are eighths
of top notch, super dank, crystal-y dank,
[SPEAKER_02]: homegrown nugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: By homegrown, I mean by a caregiver,
which loved his plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were all organic, nothing funky put
in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're looking about 25 and eighths,
if you know the guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're out of the loop, maybe up to 35.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ounces are $200 all day long in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find them for $150.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen them for $250.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go to the shops, you may feel a
little dirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little more expensive there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to tell us what rec and medical
prices are, bro, since you're more
[SPEAKER_02]: informed?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it depends on the shop, but medical
prices will go from $150 to $260,
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen it, for an ounce.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just depends on the shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the weed?
[SPEAKER_04]: And the weed, but sometimes you can get
good deals.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just never know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Average is about $180, $200 for an ounce.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then rec, I haven't been to any other
rec shops but mine, so I couldn't say
[SPEAKER_04]: really.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to tell us what you charge for
an ounce of recreational weed at your
[SPEAKER_04]: shop?
[SPEAKER_04]: Regular shelf is $395, I think,
before tax.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then top shelf for the bad ass shit is
$460 before tax.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're looking at about $460 after tax and
$540 after tax.
[SPEAKER_04]: Depending on the quality of weed you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: $80 worth of tax on an ounce of weed?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's 17.4%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.
[SPEAKER_04]: A $65.08 will cost you $76 and change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I divide my ounce into four separate
quarters?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to cost you quarter prices.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not even going to hook a brother up
and give me... We can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the way the tax is.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to fucking pay for the tax on that
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to go change my pants after that
section of the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to fade out here real quick
and we're going to bring in the outdoor
[SPEAKER_02]: grow lesson from our good friend Jesse and
then we'll also be back with a very
[SPEAKER_02]: special Give Thanks portion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_02]: This portion of the podcast is brought to
you by our good friends at Oilslick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out Oilslickpad.com for more
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oilslick, tools to help you concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that's loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're hanging out here with my good buddy,
Jesse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I was talking to Jesse the other
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: He sent me a text message.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, hey bro, the outdoor season's
coming and I want to teach people how to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, if we're going to do it,
we got to do it soon because it's getting
[SPEAKER_02]: warm.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, how about tonight?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the dude is here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got Jesse over there on the mic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say what's up, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, hey, what's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a puppet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming on, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming to share some knowledge
with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I should start.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long have you been growing outdoors?
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be my seventh or eighth season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of my earliest memories in life are
kind of run around in a dope patch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's seven or eight years on my own,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's I've been around.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's respectable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like you know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like your parents are a bunch of
damn hippies from the way you talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been accused of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been accused of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We won't pry too much there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had weighed on and asked about his dad
and it almost made him cry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just picking on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your fondest, your earliest memories
are running around in a dope patch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some super fond memories of that because
the images that come through my head are
[SPEAKER_02]: just joyous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wore overalls a lot as a child,
barefoot.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the mountains, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet you had that beard when you were a
kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a level 10 beard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pro status shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Funny story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to think my dad was a skunk farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet a lot of people would agree with
that, that knew him.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, always in the fall,
he went hunting for skunks and that's why
[SPEAKER_01]: the freezer stunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out there for a couple of days chopping
down all the skunks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bastards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I wanted to start growing outdoors in
Colorado or even California or most of the
[SPEAKER_02]: warmer parts of the country, now is the
time, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to get those holes dug and start
getting clones out there.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're lucky, you're... Well,
if you're not in Colorado, you've started
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So guys in Cali are already in the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Already in the ground.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Catching my breath from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We took some dads earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll take us a minute to get rolling,
but we'll get it started.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you put the mic just a little closer
to your face?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're shy, but we'd like to hear
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ideally, you know, if you're growing
from seed, you've wanted to start a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time ago, especially if you're growing
from regular seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that you can sex them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sex them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even possibly you're growing a clone of
the original seed plant outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So trying to stay more basic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feminine seeds are great for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hence, I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't done it yet, but I suspect some
heart of gold would kill outdoors here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would agree with that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some was grown last year in Maryland,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was well done.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So clones, you can start a little later.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, ideally by this point,
you got about a 12 to 18 foot little bush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inch.
Inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll correct you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get carried away.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: 18 foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be some weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got a 12.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully we've got a 12 inch to 18 inch
little bush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been topped lots of times.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, I'll make a note to talk about
topping in the future because that's a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole other topic that I'll get into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just kind of divides the growth and
makes one growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, I just got complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you take the top shoot out of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The main top part that you're going to
tell is going to grow a big top cola and
[SPEAKER_02]: you cut that branch out and hopefully you
just left a nice Y-shaped intersection
[SPEAKER_02]: with two tops now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And instead of one giant cola,
you're going to get two nice fat colas
[SPEAKER_02]: that are going to hopefully weigh more
than that one would have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the theory.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you learn to do it in the right
spots at the right time, you can create a
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking dragon with 55 heads on it if you
know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you start early enough and that's when
the outdoor stuff gets good is when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking several times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big, big bushes, Christmas trees,
the stuff that everyone imagines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The stuff that you dream about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see little, you think a little elves
crawling around.
[SPEAKER_02]: The stalk should be at least as big around
as your finger by now, your middle finger,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe a little thicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, actually we kind of had a
cold snap here locally that might've kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of rained on a few people's parade.
[SPEAKER_01]: If people went out early, they had some
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, this is a little early,
but it's a safe time to go out from here
[SPEAKER_01]: to, you know, June 15th is a completely
safe time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today's May 15th.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're recording just so that people have a
reference.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing to speak on on that is if you
have your plants indoor, say under a 24
[SPEAKER_01]: hour light cycle, and they're root bound
and you put them outside right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only have about 15 hours of light right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of sativa plants, that's plenty
enough to trigger blooming coming from a
[SPEAKER_01]: stressed out 24 hour light cycle or 18
hour light cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's totally right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's trying to elaborate, but he's also
taken a chunk from a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he's totally right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're putting your plants that have
been outdoors since January or inside
[SPEAKER_02]: since January, they're in pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're starting to get root band bound
because you're putting it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just waiting to put them outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you reduce that flowering time and
they're already stressed enough,
[SPEAKER_02]: they will start to flower, which is
actually probably a good thing here in
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to because unfortunately in
July, it's going to come out of flower and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to go back into veg and then it
won't go back into flower till August.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that can really mess some stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the time of year for windowsill
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally growers advise against window
plants, but this is the time of year to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's safe to have that plant in
the window, getting used to the natural
[SPEAKER_01]: light cycle and everything.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of milk it on and off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe have a little T5 above it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would a greenhouse be ideal about now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as long as it's not stressed,
you know, nice fresh clone would be pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: safe in there and it's going to go ahead
and start vegging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would a little bit of high nitrogen
feeding slow down the bloom process to
[SPEAKER_02]: help prevent that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you guys don't overdo it,
but just when you put them out there,
[SPEAKER_02]: feed a little extra nitrogen if you're
doing it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of root inoculations can never
go wrong with a lot of root inoculants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, a larger containers is
the best way to fix a root bound plant.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking before the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said that the best way to do it is
always to throw that plant into the dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can get it into the earth,
that's the best way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Firm believer in attaching, you know,
when it's, man, I got to think of a good
[SPEAKER_01]: way to explain this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I believe plants do better when
they're attached to the earth and not in
[SPEAKER_01]: the container full of peat moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that that's a bad way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think they're better in the earth.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes good sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organics are really hard to mess up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's, that's the easiest way
to do organics and have stellar results in
[SPEAKER_01]: my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you say, and this may be some,
you said the word hippy dippy shit
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier, so maybe that's what this is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think, is it the vibration of the
earth?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it that connectedness?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, uh, I, I believe a lot in that sort
of stuff in the growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that that's part of why our
growth stand out because we agree that the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant is in the earth and us and the
atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all have this symbiotic relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and I, I learned a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had adopted this style before,
but then I learned a lot more of it from
[SPEAKER_02]: Soma.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys are familiar with the old
breeder Soma, if you're not do some
[SPEAKER_02]: reading on Soma.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've gotten ourselves up to,
uh, we're vegging outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should, uh, rewind and talk about
maybe, uh, having a secure garden and
[SPEAKER_02]: being, having a legal garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's up to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to be legal in Colorado,
we advise you to be legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have, uh, six plants as a medical
patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you can have six plants as a civilian
over the age of 21.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do believe that half of those need to be
in flower and half of those need to be in
[SPEAKER_02]: veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can put three large plants outside
as long as they're not accessible or
[SPEAKER_02]: visible to the general public.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amendment 20 says, uh, it amendment 20 is
real open.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the medical bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it needs to be a secured area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, basically as I, you know, I can't
recall perbatum, but, uh, or perbatum,
[SPEAKER_01]: but whatever that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but amendment 64 does mention some
stuff and this is a locked, enclosed,
[SPEAKER_01]: secured facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So depending on, you know, to me,
that says dog kennel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something just like that is what I was
thinking too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, uh, greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Greenhouse would be perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, anything, shit, if you've got locks on
your gate, I chicken coop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or in your just backyard in general,
I think that should be enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you did your, you tried your best.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three per adult at residence, you know,
that's, uh, three plants is plenty enough
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow a person, uh, an ounce a week here
in Southern Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said that earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you could produce, uh, 52 ounces off
of three large plants and that gives you
[SPEAKER_02]: an ounce a week, which would save,
I'm going to do some fake math here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I'm going to go low.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to guess that an ounce is about
300 bucks in a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medical medical medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm a wreck, it's even more wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say 400 for now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're looking at 400 bucks times 52.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I don't need a calculator to know that
I'm going to save a shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ton of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like switching to Geico just by
growing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Switching to Geico.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fix a sound issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This piece right here needs to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to smash it with the hammer
after the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ballast home went away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ballast home.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that may have been why it took us
a while to realize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just hear that hum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, when I drew at home all the time,
I would wake up and not hear the hum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when you know something's
wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too quiet in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to go run and look in the flower
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you realize it's off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you know, uh, don't grow it in
front of everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't rub it in anyone's face.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, keep it in your backyard,
uh, fence secured.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you live in Pueblo, just grow a bunch
of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What'd you have to worry about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I've got security written down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, thieves are your biggest problem here
in Pueblo other than, well, the cops
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't even that big of a deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the thieves around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cops are cool in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I've had a few run ins with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a weird avenue for me to even go
down, but think about what you're bringing
[SPEAKER_02]: when you're setting up an outdoor garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do run into a thief, if you do
catch somebody out there, think about what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to do before the time comes
because everybody has a, they've got big
[SPEAKER_02]: balls when they're thinking and talking,
but you're going to have to deal with some
[SPEAKER_02]: shit if that does happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So think about what you're bringing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that's a shitty avenue to go down,
set up some security cameras, have a dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dogs do wonders and, um, uh, getting your,
your stuff ripped off is a very humbling
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also, uh, there's a, there's a few
stages of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the denial.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the fuck it's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And who could it be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was everyone.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it wasn't anyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you find it on the somebody
selling you an eighth of it on the street.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're just glad you tried.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so yeah, that's a weird avenue to even
mention, but be prepared.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you're going to do because somebody
may attempt to steal your shit and please
[SPEAKER_02]: don't shoot them over marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grow more next year.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, human lives are worth way more than,
than marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't shoot anybody over your pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a crime.
[SPEAKER_02]: That becomes a crime.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're, uh, you're protecting your
criminal enterprise at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just let them have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're going to come steal it like
that, if you were, if you're a fighter and
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't have a weapon and you're brave
like that, do that, but don't pull out a
[SPEAKER_02]: firearm, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not in the name of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little barkers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two little chihuahuas that'll let you know
who's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to honey.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up honey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: You little fucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, we should back up once more into
soil prep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we've got nice big 12 inch tall
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been 18 inch tall plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got stocks bigger than my middle
finger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, they've been topped, uh, now they need
to go into the dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should prep the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to dig a nice size hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should prep some soil to put in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you, what do you like to add to
your outdoor mix?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I organic, um, Jesse's all about the
organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a hippie in disguise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make my own compost, uh, slash worm
casting kind of combined thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, lots of bone meal,
lots of blood mill, uh, fish bone meal,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, azomite lime, uh, kelp mill,
um, rock phosphate, worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: It said that guanos, lots of guanos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't know to me, that's all basic
stuff, but that sounds like a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's all in very small dosages of
each piece, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, for beginners, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guanos you'll kind of beef up on the
fish meal, blood meal, bone meal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go heavy on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the other stuff just, you can try
lightly and you'll still have good
[SPEAKER_02]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, do not use anything from like Home
Depot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get anything with Scots or Miracle
Girl on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll taste like shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it'll burn your plants and don't
support that shit anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't, don't put that in our earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're growing your own cannabis,
you want better products going into your,
[SPEAKER_02]: what you're putting in, you're going to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: So try to stay as close to natural and as
friendly with the earth as you can think
[SPEAKER_02]: about the impact you're leaving on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's your backyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your patch of dirt, but hopefully
you're going to grow there next year and
[SPEAKER_02]: next year and next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one day, maybe your kids are
going to grow there or somebody's kids are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to grow there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So be conscious of what you're doing to
our earth, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool to hear that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to remind them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and like you said, that's your patch
of earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that means those words mean
a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so your kids are with one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ideally you would, uh, make sure soil
earlier, you know, nice warm day in March
[SPEAKER_01]: or something like that, or in April,
uh, put it in the ground water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cover it with plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, turn it a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just helps, uh, kind of activate
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called, uh, lots of different slang
words for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, cooking your soil, brewing your
soil, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you see a white webbing stuff on there,
that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't freak out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't, don't panic.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is life happening in your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that life is going to transfer right
into your plants and your plants are going
[SPEAKER_02]: to have a big life orgasm in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but if you didn't do that,
don't freak out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, you know, it, that doesn't ruin
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're, you know, just hearing this,
uh, it's, you know, you're still fine to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, make sure soil, uh, you know,
pretty much follow the directions on the
[SPEAKER_01]: back of the boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, uh, uh, bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we have done anything by now for
bugs or animals or pests or anything
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoors?
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I'm an indoor guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot I'm learning with you on this,
or I'm learning with the listeners on this
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor lesson.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my opinion here in the Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are more good bugs outside than
there are bad bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, pesticides outside, um, I've never
used them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in my, in my ideal world, whatever is
eating my plant today, tomorrow,
[SPEAKER_02]: something is going to come to eat that
critter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that critter gets out of control
tomorrow, somebody will eat that and
[SPEAKER_02]: hopefully mother nature and the eco will
balance me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why organics aren't so
important outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, when, when you dump salts
and stuff like that into the earth,
[SPEAKER_01]: it, it kills it and it kills the Beatles
and it kills the bugs and which kills the
[SPEAKER_02]: birds, which kills the bees.
[SPEAKER_02]: When he says salts, he's talking about,
uh, bottled nutrients, almost everything
[SPEAKER_02]: we're buying in a bottle, be it the vegan
or organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a salt based nutrient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, which mostly just kills all your
Michael's anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we've got healthy, fat soil,
rich soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we got some tall plants in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're top, they're starting to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, those are going to get out of hand
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we just topped them like 50 times.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got a bunch of heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we, uh, keep that under control?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well, uh, you can take, uh,
like some four by four metal fencing hog
[SPEAKER_01]: fencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's commonly referred to,
uh, make a 36, 48 inch, uh, wide,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, a super tomato cage basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, fasten it to the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you're able to pull the plant
down, um, and redirect the growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so you want to spread it out just like
you would endorse to kind of get the light
[SPEAKER_02]: down in the sun down in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you're able to make the plant bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's also a good security device.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have to turn it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to make, uh, maybe tie a bell
or two to that cage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: See that wakes up your little chihuahua.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's see, run out there and rescue the
crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully you're just scaring away some
punks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm picturing like this big cylinder of
tomato caging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like maybe like my plants in a
cage and I'm going to put that on early
[SPEAKER_02]: enough to where my plant has, I don't have
to struggle to get my plant into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 36 to 48 inches, you guys, that's three
to four feet around.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we're planning on this little
tiny 18 inch plant turning into a,
[SPEAKER_02]: how tall do I need that my cage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, five, six foot.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, uh, most privacy foot six foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, unfortunately I've always grown
behind privacy fence.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, make it six inches shorter than
the fence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, let's keep it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep her down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your, uh, your nodes, uh, the arms of
the plant are going to grow up basically,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're going to want to grab one of
those and weave it through that tomato
[SPEAKER_02]: cage to where the outside looks like it's
got just a bunch of arms poking out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then those will be strong enough to
hold themselves up because they've been
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoors and I'm not going to need to
stake them after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, another thing is, uh, um, a good thing
to hook this cage to is like, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, a wooden frame made out like four by
fours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that also helps hold the water in for
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can water it proper amounts and
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like a slightly raised bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically a little micro bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, and a depression in the
ground there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, these, these plants will use up to
five gallons of water a day easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So keep that in mind, you guys,
for these plants that we're planting,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're doing three of them to stay
legal, you need 15 gallons of water a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to have to think about how
you're going to get that water there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're doing it somewhere that's,
that's by the time they're blooming
[SPEAKER_01]: easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's the biggest thing,
uh, outdoors is keep those guys bothered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to water, water, lots of
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really, really hard to overwater.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, in Southern Colorado soil,
really hard for marijuana, especially in
[SPEAKER_02]: that outdoor sun we get here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think the, uh, this is random.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think the difference we get in the,
uh, heat during the day and the cold at
[SPEAKER_02]: night plays a big difference in the flavor
and potency of our cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we get a lot of tasty fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cantaloupes and the peaches are
delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it has something to do with
that cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sour D loves it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, don't tell everybody that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, if they've got a good sour D cut,
let's help them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're growing that sour, do you send
a note?
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't send anything when you see me,
share me.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have that, if you have one of those
hard to find ones, they really love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a guy around here with a cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we going to have to do any more
pruning?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to indoors?
[SPEAKER_02]: I cut off all that bottom shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do lolly popping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to do that as much on an
outdoor crop?
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I like to haul the plants out
basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do the fruit trees over in Palisade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so your plants four foot in
circumference, uh, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is totally situational,
but you know, just approximately,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, 12 to 18 inches of, uh,
plant links, every man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I see what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably going to have to edit this
part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, you know, from the, uh,
um, from the outside in, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: every, you know, about 18 inches,
you just want to pretty much strip
[SPEAKER_01]: everything off the main branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, if there isn't a branch
itself, um, keep them nice and hollow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That helps air flow in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of airflow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking about molds earlier,
bug deterrents, bug deterrents.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want moldy weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have caterpillar, caterpillar issues
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are those orange things we get
here?
[SPEAKER_02]: There are these little orange worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've only, only happens around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've seen them brown and yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen orange ones, but yeah,
yeah, they totally, uh, they're from
[SPEAKER_01]: moths.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spruce moth.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes good sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's their larvae and their,
their parents were way hippie and decided
[SPEAKER_01]: to lay their kids a bunch of pot plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it actually happens, uh, early in,
uh, the bud development and you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: really notice it till about harvest time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't find it to harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And please, if you do find shit like that,
don't make hash out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just, just cut it out of that bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never, you know, you know,
discard that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, it's, it doesn't affect the
entire plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just affects the area around the bug
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of the few, uh, pests that
is, doesn't ruin the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that's another good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some of my pitfalls are going to
be growing outdoors in Colorado?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if you don't have good air circulation
in the fall, you're going to get powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, make sure you don't overplant your
area and you have plenty of air
[SPEAKER_01]: circulation around your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you should be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, if you planted in the four
foot area between your shed and your back
[SPEAKER_01]: fence and your side fence, and there's a
bush growing on the side and you threw a
[SPEAKER_01]: tarp over the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the neighbors in the second story
building couldn't see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably going to get mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like growing indoors with that
aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let mother nature do her thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, spider mites I have seen outdoors
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's really hard to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's mostly from sloppy indoor goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just carrying them out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you should be taking care of that
inside anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and those were ruin your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: The powdery mold and you want to talk
about sad people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one thing to throw away an indoor
plant because it had one of those things
[SPEAKER_01]: throw away an entire outdoor plant is
yeah, we're hoping to grow 52 ounces here
[SPEAKER_02]: with these three outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I've only got a couple more
questions for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we're, uh, we're going to try to,
we're going to try to do segments.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have them back in a couple
of weeks and we'll have Jesse back in a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll have him back in a couple
of weeks after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully it'll be harvest time and
he'll bring some of his outdoor harvest
[SPEAKER_02]: with them to share with us and talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys can, yeah, we'll all talk
shop on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, what day, uh, around when am I going
to go into flower outdoors here in
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado this year?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, July 15th around then the hours will
start going negative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the, the hours in the day will start
getting shorter.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, up until then they're going to start
getting longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cannabis only needs about 14 hours of
daylight to make it start flowering
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, when the sun sets, this is some trip
shit and I may get this wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the sun sets, it starts putting off a
red spectrum and that red spectrum
[SPEAKER_02]: triggers the hormones in the plant to
sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it kind of tucks it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people talk about, well,
it's not 1212 outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why am I flowering?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that red spectrum in the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of messing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not messing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's doing exactly what it should do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's telling your plants in the night and
in the morning it's blue and that wakes
[SPEAKER_02]: them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard, I read in a old DJ short book
or no, anyways, I know DJ short is where I
[SPEAKER_01]: heard this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, it's only about an hour,
hour and a half that makes these plants
[SPEAKER_01]: flower outside versus indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's anywhere from 12 to, uh, six hours
difference of light that makes them
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the, that equatorial stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, if you're coming from Thailand and
places like that or more jungly regions,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and outdoors, um, different strains
will flower at different times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, your sativas go first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've, I've noticed your land race
plants will go first too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, hybrids typically go last.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: When is my, when should I really be
focused on getting these things down by,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, as far as harvesting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's my harvest date?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's my deadline?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, do I just sit outside and watch for
that first frost?
[SPEAKER_01]: Three hours before it freezes the first
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, um, that's really hard to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, when they're done,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But by the end of September, it's not
going to freeze and most plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: acceptable to harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So safe, safe to take down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you were talking about strain
selection, uh, without giving me any
[SPEAKER_02]: shameless plugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm sure I know, I do know that a
couple of my strains weren't quite well
[SPEAKER_02]: outside, but what kind of stuff would work
well for the Colorado region around us?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you know any of the popular cuts
that people have got, I know golden goat
[SPEAKER_02]: is a good outdoor, but it takes a minute
to finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to be patient with that girl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, what else would you throw outside?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, like I suspect heart of gold would
kill, um, anything with Kim dog roots does
[SPEAKER_01]: excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So put some grateful dog heart of gold
bounty killer outside would probably be
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, flow does really good, uh,
flow and blueberry honestly are two of the
[SPEAKER_02]: best performing outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've, I've never done my own outdoor,
but I have helped a couple of guys and the
[SPEAKER_02]: flow and the blueberry always blew my mind
when he did them outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, ghost bubble does really good outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good strain too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, doesn't yield good, but she tastes
amazing outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, golden goat's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, sour diesel actually does pretty good
around here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, some guys in a little town outside of
here that man, they kill that outdoor sour
[SPEAKER_02]: D shout out guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to bust your spot,
but shout out lemon cheese.
[SPEAKER_01]: Short bus people Colorado green bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, those are all local strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to pack a short bus that
somebody handed me at the first,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's from that same little town.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just walked by and planted them on
me, kept going.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you've got some room, bro, if you have
got some room, um, locally bred strains
[SPEAKER_01]: always do better.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they were bred here, um, to plain and
simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why, but they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's their environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, yeah, I had one more question,
but I can't think of it off the top of my
[SPEAKER_02]: head.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll save it for next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was right at 30 minutes, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you got any, a couple ending things
to end on, we can save the rest for next
[SPEAKER_01]: time or, um, pest pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do use them, please use like neem
oil, um, organic ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't, don't kill the bees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feed with teas, but yeah, we'll get to
that next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll make a note to talk about teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and security, don't tell anyone that
doesn't need to know even if it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: even if you're in a legal state,
don't tell anyone that doesn't need to
[SPEAKER_01]: know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be your first suspect when it gets
stolen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that's going to fuck up
friendships.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And more than likely that person didn't do
it, but it's really hard not to think they
[SPEAKER_01]: did.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, one thing I was going to mention,
if you're going to get some stuff tested,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, well, you can't get stuff tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just changed the rules here in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, if you were able to get stuff tested,
do you think the outdoor stuff is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: test considerably higher than the indoor
stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to see that, uh, indoor ISIS
backed is probably going to have higher
[SPEAKER_01]: THC, uh, simply because it doesn't have
the dust and the wind and the rain on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think the sun outnumbers all of that
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we should, uh, we should grow the same
strain indoors and out and see what we can
[SPEAKER_02]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I do think will happen outdoors is
you're going to have a lot of these other
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids are going to be off the
charts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my theory.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our grow lights are only bringing out
specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that why we're getting so much lemonade
and things?
[SPEAKER_01]: I, yeah, I wonder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, here's something I've never shared.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want more lemon flavor,
I've never, I don't think I've told
[SPEAKER_02]: anybody this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I read it, uh, in something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it was steep hill or something
like that long time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want more lemon flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lemonine can be increased.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost a stress reaction by making
too much light and too much heat on the
[SPEAKER_02]: tops of your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll increase your lemonine and lemony
limey kind of flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a safety reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, this is just over 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put a couple of ads and some more
stuff onto the here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you got any plugs or anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse grows on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: All one word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and Gardner Whedon on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spelled weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll, uh, I'll tag them on our Instagram
page so they can find us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, yeah, yeah, that's about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Jesse will be back in a couple of
weeks and, uh, Hey, thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll add some more to this piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
thanks for joining us for our first grow
[SPEAKER_02]: lesson.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a very special feature from my
buddy, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give him a big thanks for coming
and spending some time with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse got a little nervous on the
microphone, but by the third or fourth
[SPEAKER_02]: time we have him on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure he'll be nice and relaxed.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the portion of the show where I
take a minute to give thanks to somebody I
[SPEAKER_02]: feel has been beneficial or crucial to the
cannabis movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the past two episodes I've given
thanks to Jorge Cervantes and Ed Rosenthal
[SPEAKER_02]: because they were very important in my,
uh, my development and my education as a
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to continue that, uh,
that series and give thanks to Robert
[SPEAKER_02]: Connell Clark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Robert Connell Clark is a native born
Californian.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wrote and illustrated the botany and
ecology of cannabis as his undergraduate
[SPEAKER_02]: thesis at university of California at
Santa Cruz, where he graduated with
[SPEAKER_02]: honors.
[SPEAKER_02]: He later self published his thesis and
started pods pressed, uh, in Ben Lamon,
[SPEAKER_02]: California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clark has published articles in high times
magazine and other journals on his
[SPEAKER_02]: favorite subject.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a well-known cannabis photographer,
his photos and illustrations have appeared
[SPEAKER_02]: in numerous magazines, books, posters,
and calendars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clark continues to travel throughout the
West interviewing cultivators and fellow
[SPEAKER_02]: researchers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clark carries an active correspondence
with the major cannabis researchers
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is reflected in the in-depth and
accuracy of his writings on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Robert Connell Clark, uh, is
responsible for a lot of my breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, he wrote, he wrote a book called
marijuana botany.
[SPEAKER_02]: He also wrote cannabis evolution and
ethnobotany.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he also wrote the book called hashish,
which also has a updated version.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the book marijuana botany,
uh, every grower that's trying to reach
[SPEAKER_02]: the next level should read this book.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're thinking about breeding,
this is the book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Book ticket.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is basically an instruction book on
how to breed high grade cannabis and to
[SPEAKER_02]: hit the goals you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to take a moment and say,
thank you, Robert Connell Clark.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been very crucial and instrumental
in my cannabis education.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wouldn't be the breeder that I am
without you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So big thanks to Robert Connell Clark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big thanks to you guys for listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, stay tuned because next week we have
our special dab episode coming up and I
[SPEAKER_02]: hope you guys join us for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give a big thanks to Jesse and
Kevin for joining us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hope to see you next time until then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for
me.

[SPEAKER_02]: Big love.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so I'm hanging out on a rainy
Sunday night here in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_02]: coming to you guys with the promised dab
episode, but before we do that,
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to read a little bit of news.
[SPEAKER_02]: A few episodes ago, I told you guys about
the Colorado Symphony inviting folks to
[SPEAKER_02]: bring cannabis to their concerts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the concerts have since happened,
and I've got a little article here from
[SPEAKER_02]: the Denver Post written by John Wenzel.
[SPEAKER_02]: The headline is,
[SPEAKER_02]: The Colorado Symphony Orchestra's first
classically cannabis event began Friday
[SPEAKER_02]: night like any other fine arts fundraiser,
with suit and dress-wearing attendees
[SPEAKER_02]: politely mingling in a high-ceiling art
gallery, sipping drinks and shaking hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: No clouds of pot smoke, no tight-eyed
t-shirts, not at first anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: A closer look revealed the distinctly
cannabis-related nature of the event.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first of three fundraisers in which
invite-only attendees were encouraged to
[SPEAKER_02]: bring their own
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana, Friday's classically cannabis
event also featured a patio on which
[SPEAKER_02]: attendees had a large door that opened
into the patio, which led to another small
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor area with food trucks and a pair
of ice cream and popsicle vendors where
[SPEAKER_02]: attendees also openly smoked cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: The event, which was switched from public
to private after the City of Denver warned
[SPEAKER_02]: the CSO about the illegality of public
marijuana consumption, has garnered
[SPEAKER_02]: international attention and speculation
since it was announced.
[SPEAKER_02]: The 250 or so attendees shelled out at
least $75 per person to support the CSO's
[SPEAKER_02]: experiment in culture bridging.
[SPEAKER_02]: These little gray areas are bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to learn how to get it together so
we can all consume cannabis safely
[SPEAKER_02]: together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, look around.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not stoner town, said Evan Lasky,
executive vice president of the CSO,
[SPEAKER_02]: who characterized the series as just
another design to tap into new donors.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to build new audiences because the
older people are dying off.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to fight this perception of
elitism.
[SPEAKER_02]: The CSO brass quintet, dressed in
all-black suits with pale green ties,
[SPEAKER_02]: began its 45-minute performance with
Richard Strauss' ominous, also-sprocked
[SPEAKER_02]: Zarathustra fanfare, followed by short
speeches from the CSO and sponsors.
[SPEAKER_02]: The acoustics in the unadorned space were
sharp and bright as the quintet continued
[SPEAKER_02]: with recognizable classic favorites.
[SPEAKER_02]: The chatter of side conversations from
attendees who stood or milled about due to
[SPEAKER_02]: the casual, non-seated setup nearly
rivaled the quintet's volume at times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Compared to the average Red Rocks show,
it was a state affair, but it's unlikely
[SPEAKER_02]: any sponsored, official classic music
event with a city organization has ever
[SPEAKER_02]: attracted so, so much open marijuana
consumption or contended with so much weed
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke hanging in the humid air.
[SPEAKER_02]: Co-organizer Jane West of cannabis company
Edible Events said $30,000 had already
[SPEAKER_02]: been secured in sponsorship for the night,
and CSO officials confirmed another
[SPEAKER_02]: $20,000 was garnered from attendees.
[SPEAKER_02]: The CSO is hoping to raise $200,000 from
the three space gallery shows and another
[SPEAKER_02]: non-pot-sanctioned classically cannabis
event at Red Rocks this summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: There didn't used to be any events I felt
welcomed at, said West, but after
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization happened, we wanted to start
putting on events that we would actually
[SPEAKER_02]: go to.
[SPEAKER_02]: For their part, the CSO musicians treated
it just like another gig, even as the
[SPEAKER_02]: smell of weed began wafting to the
opposite side of the gallery where they
[SPEAKER_02]: warmed up in a private room.
[SPEAKER_02]: We love playing chamber music wherever,
said trombone player Greg Harper.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just going to play the pieces we
know and hopefully people will appreciate
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it sounds like a lot of people
appreciated it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were plenty of people in attendance
and a lot of money was made.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why can't this be an example?
[SPEAKER_02]: There were no negative events.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were no fights.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were no crimes committed here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a great, great event.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why can't we do this at Red Rocks?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why can't they say a symphony at Red
Rocks?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why can't they say reggae show?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why can't they say any concert at Red
Rocks?
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring a joint, have a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't care that you're smoking
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: All it's going to do is make you hungrier
and thirstier and make you enjoy the show
[SPEAKER_02]: more.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to benefit everybody at Red
Rocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to sell more food.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to sell more drinks.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people there are going to enjoy the
concert more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see a problem with smoking a
little bit of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's legal and it creates commerce,
stoner commerce, munchie commerce,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I'm going to find the next news
article.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to read a little bit of news
so we can hurry up and get into the dab
[SPEAKER_02]: section.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, our next article comes out of
Canyon City and the headline is Potheads
[SPEAKER_02]: Against Potholes Hits Streets for March in
Canyon City.
[SPEAKER_02]: The article is by Carrie Canterbury from
the Canyon City Daily Record.
[SPEAKER_02]: About 50 citizens took part in a march
down Main Street just before Monday's
[SPEAKER_02]: regular city council meeting to voice
support for retail marijuana in Canyon
[SPEAKER_02]: City.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys don't know where Canyon City
is, that's a little bit west of Pueblo,
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit west of Pueblo West actually,
probably 40, 30, 40 minutes outside of
[SPEAKER_02]: Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a gorgeous little town.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of great stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a lot of great friends out there
that are in the rafting business.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's up guys, giving you a shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go visit Canyon City, see what's out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, Fremont Cannabis owner and event
organizer, Dana Sue said the group
[SPEAKER_02]: Potheads Against Potholes also hosted a
cookout complete with volleyball and other
[SPEAKER_02]: entertainment at the formal Canyon Floral
Building at 111 Main Street before the
[SPEAKER_02]: march.
[SPEAKER_02]: She said about a hundred people attended
the cookout ranging in age from the early
[SPEAKER_02]: twenties to the eighties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the eighties, their eighties.
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't from the eighties.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in their eighties.
[SPEAKER_02]: The response was way more positive than
negative, Sue said.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were kind of surprised.
[SPEAKER_02]: We weren't sure how people were going to
feel about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a lot of honks and people screaming
and waving.
[SPEAKER_02]: The group ended the march at City Hall
where participants sat in on the city
[SPEAKER_02]: council meeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sue said they wanted to show the council
that there are supporters for retail
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana in the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: The last meeting was in the middle of the
day and it's kind of hard for people who
[SPEAKER_02]: work to get there, she said.
[SPEAKER_02]: City council members Kevin Dittmore,
Colby Kachmar and Dennis Weid walked with
[SPEAKER_02]: the group for part of the march.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad to see that there are some
pro-retail marijuana people starting to
[SPEAKER_02]: show up for some of our events,
Weid said.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've made no secret about it that I
certainly am in favor of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's ridiculous for us to turn
over control of retail marijuana to our
[SPEAKER_02]: neighboring cities, Pueblo West and
Salida.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we should be the ones who control
what goes on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The general government committee on May
7th by majority agreement elected to
[SPEAKER_02]: extend the moratorium beyond the November
election to allow a vote on the matter and
[SPEAKER_02]: set the question to be asked on the
November 4th ballot.
[SPEAKER_02]: The current moratorium expires July 1st.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ordinances are expected to be
presented to council for first reading
[SPEAKER_02]: during the June 2nd meeting and if
approved, second reading and adoption
[SPEAKER_02]: would be during the June 16th meeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: City Administrator Doug Dotson said the
first ordinance would extend the
[SPEAKER_02]: moratorium and would set question on the
ballot for public vote.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second ordinance would ask if the
first one approved if there should be
[SPEAKER_02]: additional sales or excise tax on the sale
of retail marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to highly advise them to vote
against that because when we legalize
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational cannabis here in Pueblo,
in the county when the shops opened up,
[SPEAKER_02]: they are required to charge 25% tax on
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you buy a $100 bag, it's now a $125
bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: So vote that down if you get the option.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let's get back into the article.
[SPEAKER_02]: During Monday's meeting Mayor Tony Greer
said there's a rumor circulating that
[SPEAKER_02]: there is a conspiracy for Ketchmar to
recuse himself from voting on the retail
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana issue specifically so that Greer
can vote in favor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Greer said that is not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not made up my mind on that Greer
said.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is why we have public hearing.
[SPEAKER_02]: When clarifying the May 7 meeting minutes,
Ketchmar said during that meeting he
[SPEAKER_02]: thought it looked like a good idea to send
the issue to voters but at this point he
[SPEAKER_02]: does need to abstain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's going to be kicked
back, he said.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really not sure where we are going
with it at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so there's no certainty in the
future of recreational marijuana in Canyon
[SPEAKER_02]: City.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys are in Canyon City,
do what you got to do to get out there and
[SPEAKER_02]: vote, get out there and wave signs,
encourage your congresspeople.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to get some recreational cannabis
for you guys out there in Canyon City.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I got another news article up
here and then we're going to get into the
[SPEAKER_02]: hash section of the show as promised and
do a little hash 101.
[SPEAKER_02]: And speaking of hash, that brings me into
our next news article.
[SPEAKER_02]: This article is written by Mr. William
Breeds and the headline is new Colorado
[SPEAKER_02]: hash laws signed by governor, but what do
they actually do?
[SPEAKER_02]: The article says yesterday governor John
Hickenlooper signed a baker's dozen worth
[SPEAKER_02]: of bills on various topics, but arguably
the two most high profile measures had to
[SPEAKER_02]: do with marijuana legislation to establish
a one ounce of cannabis equivalent for
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrates and a proposal to make
marijuana edibles more identifiable.
[SPEAKER_02]: A prominent marijuana advocate praises
these measures as examples of responsible
[SPEAKER_02]: legislation, even though it's quite
unclear at this point what the new laws
[SPEAKER_02]: will actually do.
[SPEAKER_02]: The summary notes that the bill directs
the department of revenue to promulgate
[SPEAKER_02]: rules, establishing the equivalent of one
ounce of retail marijuana flower in
[SPEAKER_02]: various retail marijuana products.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bill authorizes the department to
contract for a scientific study of the
[SPEAKER_02]: equivalency of marijuana flower in
marijuana products, but there's no telling
[SPEAKER_02]: what that means in practical terms as
Westward outlines in the following
[SPEAKER_02]: excerpt.
[SPEAKER_02]: The legislation is vague on the specifics
of determining just how much hash is in an
[SPEAKER_02]: ounce of herb, which depends on how strong
the ounce of herb is to begin with.
[SPEAKER_02]: We kind of talked about that on this show
once a couple of episodes ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they base it on a 30% THC OG Fino or a
low THC batch of something like blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even then it's unclear whether legislators
want producers to measure total THC in an
[SPEAKER_02]: ounce or simply estimate how much hash can
be produced from an ounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of this would widely impact the amount
of concentrates that are legally approved
[SPEAKER_02]: for sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say for the sake of discussion that the
DOR determines that there are five grams
[SPEAKER_02]: of pure THC in an ounce of herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could mean in state residents,
21 and up would be able to purchase about
[SPEAKER_02]: six grams worth of 90% THC hash oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since out of state residents are currently
limited to purchasing a quarter ounce of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, they'd hypothetically only be
able to buy one or two grams at a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what Kevin and I agreed to
the last time we talked about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if the lab the state chooses bases its
findings on how much hash can be produced
[SPEAKER_02]: from an ounce of herb, the amounts can be
much lower.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've spoken with several hash makers who
tell us that a 15% average return from bud
[SPEAKER_02]: to concentrate is reasonable for VHO
extraction, which means they get about
[SPEAKER_02]: four grams of hash for every ounce of
herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ice water can be even lower, only eight to
10% resulting in top grade smokable hash
[SPEAKER_02]: and the rest suitable mostly for cooking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen people get 20 or 22% returns
from some VHO and actually I saw a guy get
[SPEAKER_02]: 34% return on some live resin the other
day, but that's not the point here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The point is they're trying to figure out
how much hash that they can sell us and
[SPEAKER_02]: how much hash is equal to the limit of
weed we're actually able to buy now
[SPEAKER_02]: because people are coming from other
states.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I pick on Texas a lot, but they're
coming from Texas and Oklahoma and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: buying seven grams of hash and it seems
sketchy to some people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's sketchy because when
the dispensaries had a lot of hash
[SPEAKER_02]: available that was good and it was new
with the hash game, I would go buy.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they had the Durbin poison hash,
I would say, can I have all of that
[SPEAKER_02]: please?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't think that was sketchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, that's enough for the news.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take a quick dab and a drink
of something here and I'm going to get
[SPEAKER_02]: into DAB 101.
[SPEAKER_02]: While I take a dab, you guys should go
check out Oilslickpad.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're dabbing with me, you're going to
need something from Oilslick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop getting your mom's table all sticky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out Oilslickpad.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, stoner dudes and stoner chicks,
gather around.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for DAB 101.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we're here for DAB 101.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start with this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is a DAB?
[SPEAKER_02]: A DAB is basically a hit of a cannabis
concentrate, which is usually PHO in my
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some solventless is DAB-able, but for now,
we're just going to focus on PHO.
[SPEAKER_02]: PHO is short for butane honey oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: A PHO is hash made with butane and the
butane is then purged off and the results
[SPEAKER_02]: are PHO of different consistencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I did say it's made with butane,
but after that, the hash is put into a
[SPEAKER_02]: vacuum chamber and heated and the butane
is removed that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not dabbing any butane if it's
done properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to teach you guys how to
make PHO because I don't want to be
[SPEAKER_02]: responsible for you guys hurting
yourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: No matter how many times we say it,
no matter how many news reports we see of
[SPEAKER_02]: people getting hurt, people still insist
on blasting hash indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please stop making PHO inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was saying we get different
consistencies of PHO.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of those different consistencies get
different names, like there's shatter,
[SPEAKER_02]: wax, crumble, earl, sap, there's snap and
peel, and then also there's the new thing,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is called live resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll describe them to you and I'm going
to start with shatter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shatter is usually amber in color.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's usually, it should shatter if you try
to break it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you heat it up with your fingers,
it will get sticky and it'll be bendable.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you first pick it up,
it should be snappy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should break like maybe like a thin
Jolly Rancher candy or something like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of what you're picking up now,
what we're finding now is shatter from the
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensaries and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really close to shatter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really close to shatter.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another type that's called sap or
snap and peel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really the same color of shatter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that amber-y gold color.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be anywhere from like a dark amber
to almost a bright yellow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got some right now that's really
dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was done with some flow and it's got
some tange in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's flowing tange.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been calling it the flange or the
flangerine or the tangelo.
[SPEAKER_02]: We kind of fuck around with the names a
lot, but that one comes out a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: darker for some reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there's some Freedom Tie Lemon Baby
dabs that have been being made recently
[SPEAKER_02]: that are coming out really light,
light gold and yellow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about the product and all about
the starting material.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll make different colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sap and the snap and peel look very
similar in color and texture to the
[SPEAKER_02]: shatter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, sap is kind of sappy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's stickier.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you fold it up in parchment paper,
it sticks to the parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sticks to your fingers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of goopier.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something that's right between
shatter and sap.
[SPEAKER_02]: I call it snap and peel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't shatter like shatter does and
it doesn't stick, but it kind of breaks
[SPEAKER_02]: off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sort of like a Laffy Taffy,
kind of like the Laffy Taffy of hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can pull off enough to get a good dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can mess with it long enough to get it
on the dabber and handle it, but it
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't break off and it doesn't stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of your better ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the snap and peel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also think that it's higher quality most
of the time when it's the snap and peel.
[SPEAKER_02]: That style usually seems to have a lot of
flavor to it, but also it seems to give a
[SPEAKER_02]: big fat hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you take a fat chunk of wax and you
hit that, you really feel that in your
[SPEAKER_02]: lungs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a kick.
[SPEAKER_02]: For some reason, shatter feels smoother to
me and the wax hits harder, which
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes I like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you like a shotgun to the head
when you're in the mood for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some wax that doesn't stick
together and that's just because of the
[SPEAKER_02]: texture of the plant material.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of things that can
contribute to that, but the crumble is
[SPEAKER_02]: basically wax that won't stay together.
[SPEAKER_02]: It crumbles apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just won't stick together for some
reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be a lot of oil in the hash
itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's shatter, wax, crumble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Earl, we just call a lot of the stuff that
we smoke Earl.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Earl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything is Earl nowadays.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of other cool names for
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also talked about live resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're making BHO, you can either use
nugs or trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that the better you put in,
the better quality you put in,
[SPEAKER_02]: the better quality you get out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people now, they're taking a plant
that is ready for harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: You cut it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You let it dry for three or four hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then at that point, you put it in the
freezer and you let it get nice and
[SPEAKER_02]: frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once the whole plant's frozen,
they put it into a closed loop system.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about that again later.
[SPEAKER_02]: They put the whole plant into a closed
loop system and they blast it with the
[SPEAKER_02]: butane that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: After it comes out of the closed loop,
they put it into a vacuum oven and they
[SPEAKER_02]: purge off all the residual butane that
could be left in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hash that comes out of that is called
live resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's some of the best tasting hash I've
ever had.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also gives me an amazing high and it
seems to last longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion, live resin would retain
more of the beneficial compounds than hash
[SPEAKER_02]: made from dried material like dried trim
or dried buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does require a closed loop and it's
pretty advanced tech.
[SPEAKER_02]: Live resin is next level shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like now is the time when I should
mention that you should not ever use
[SPEAKER_02]: contaminated material.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't ever use moldy buds or moldy trim
like if you had powdery mildew or bud rot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't use that shit in your BHO.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had bugs, if you're the only one
dabbing it, if you don't care,
[SPEAKER_02]: go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to give that to somebody,
sell that to somebody, if you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: give that to a medical patient,
if you're going to give that to a sick
[SPEAKER_02]: person, don't ever make dabs with your
buggy ass material.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not good for anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please don't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try to think about your patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think that every piece of hash you ever
make or have or even your buds,
[SPEAKER_02]: think of all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine what would happen if you gave that
stuff to a sick person because you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know where it's going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try to be conscious of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's our responsibility as growers,
as hash makers, as part of a cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: community.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what makes us the difference
between the people that care and the
[SPEAKER_02]: people that are just in it to make a buck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, be very aware of everything that
you're spraying on your plants because
[SPEAKER_02]: that's going to end up in your dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're spraying systemic neurotoxins
onto your plants, you will be dabbing
[SPEAKER_02]: systemic neurotoxins in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're planning on using that as medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what dabs are intended for,
is medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't use your medicine as something
that's going to make you sick because
[SPEAKER_02]: that's why we're using cannabis in the
first place is because we don't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: take the medicine that they're forcing
upon us that is making us sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fight the power.
[SPEAKER_02]: Help yourself fight the power.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we can do dabs, we're going to have
to talk about a gear list.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where it gets fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say that you have acquired some
dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You went to the dispensary, you called
your guy, whatever happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: However it happened, you got some high
grade dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to notice that you need some
special packaging for those dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, it came wrapped in parchment
paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it came in a little silicone
package.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're using those silicone packages,
I only recommend oil slick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oil slick is platinum cured silicone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recommend you go to oilslickpad.com and
read about the process of platinum curing
[SPEAKER_02]: their products because it's very
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you get home, get those dabs,
get it out of that parchment paper,
[SPEAKER_02]: get it out of whatever they sold it to you
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go on oilslickpad.com and get yourself a
little slick stack or a slick ball or a
[SPEAKER_02]: slick ball mini.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a couple of them and then fill all
those up with different types of dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you got a little dab collection and a
safe container to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cool thing about those slick stacks is
your hash won't stick to those.
[SPEAKER_02]: You won't get ripped off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You always feel like if you put it in
plastic or glass, you're going to get
[SPEAKER_02]: ripped off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go trying to scrape those last
couple of dabs off the plastic because
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to end up dabbing plastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to taste like shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to choke.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to suck.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to have a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got yourself a slick stack.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got your hash stored up nice and
safely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you were probably going to notice that
that hash is real sticky, kind of hard to
[SPEAKER_02]: handle.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to need to get some dab
tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe a highly educated dabber or maybe
a highly educated dabber with a carb cap
[SPEAKER_02]: on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll stand up right for you, but you need
something to stick in there to handle
[SPEAKER_02]: those dabs for you because it's going to
stick to your fingers if your fingers are
[SPEAKER_02]: warm.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to get those dabs onto the tip of
a dabber somehow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then that dabber is actually going to be
the key to your success here pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, be careful the first time you go
dabbing into a container of shatter.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to stick your dabber right
into that container.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've said it before.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as you push down into that
container of shatter, a little piece of
[SPEAKER_02]: that shatter is going to go flying off
into nowhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're never going to find it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be pissed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't lose your first dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be gentle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe stick your thumb in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Warm it up with your thumb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rub it with your thumb a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll make the hash a little softer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be more pliable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you'll be able to get a dab off of it
without wasting your first dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do launch one off into the middle
of nowhere, we always say that's one for
[SPEAKER_02]: the dead homies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to pour out a 40.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you just flick a dab off into the
middle of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be thankful that it didn't go into
your eye because when it does,
[SPEAKER_02]: it fucking burns.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so now you've got your dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got yourself some shatter or some sap.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how to get it out of the
container without wasting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time to figure out a little bit more
of this gear.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most important thing you're going to
need is a rig and a nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: A rig is basically ... Everybody tries to
call it a bong.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're smoking Earl through it,
that's your rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an oil rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: Needle rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer a small rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about that later.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the Twitter questions was,
why do I use such a small rig?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll explain that to you in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: You also need a nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nails are either made of ... Well,
they're made of titanium or my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also ceramic.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's glass and there's quartz.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a fan of the glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: They never seem to taste right to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: The quartz is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I break shit, which is also why I
don't use the ceramic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer the titanium.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm going to buy a nail, I only buy a
highly educated nail to tell you the
truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight, I've been dabbing off of a highly
educated duality nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Task.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks a lot, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I say this a lot, but really invest
in your nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a budget, spend the smaller
portion on your rig and the higher portion
[SPEAKER_02]: on your nail because you're going to be
heating that sucker up to a really high
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature, between four and 600 degrees,
maybe hotter depending on how crazy you
[SPEAKER_02]: are with the torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be heating that up and
then you're dropping your medicine onto
[SPEAKER_02]: that and you're smoking it off of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're basically inhaling whatever is
in or on that nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got some funky shit from China,
they don't care about you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our friends here in America that are
making good products, I'll recommend Hive
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'll also recommend Highly Educated.
[SPEAKER_02]: They make good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Halen Honey Hole, awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good shit right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are three products.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a quartz, you got a titanium,
and you got your ceramic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Hive, the Halen Honey Hole,
and anything from Highly Educated,
[SPEAKER_02]: any Highly Educated titanium product has
got my endorsement all day long.
[SPEAKER_02]: So get yourself a good nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like a little tiny rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said that before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're going to need a dabber and a
torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the first few things you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be careful with the torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody gets scared of you when you pull
out a blow torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be careful where you do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a little dab torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the Vector torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a little more expensive,
but they do have a lifetime guarantee.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to wrap them up in stickers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a custom torch with the Chewbacca
on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually a creme brulee torch that
came from Bed Bath and Beyond that my
[SPEAKER_02]: buddy customized for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're not a big spender,
go to Bed Bath and Beyond.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get the $30 creme brulee torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It works just as well as the Vector,
but it doesn't have a lifetime guarantee.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you got your rig, you got your
nail, you got a torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a dabber.
[SPEAKER_02]: A dabber is basically, it's a poker that
you use to drop your dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just put a little dab on the end of
it, just a little tiny dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about dab size in the future
also.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just take a little dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put it on the end of your dabber.
[SPEAKER_02]: You heat up your nail with your torch and
you don't have to go fucking destroying
[SPEAKER_02]: this thing with heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just need it hot enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you put your hand over it, you just
barely want to feel your skin tighten up
[SPEAKER_02]: and get a little hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to burn.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to touch it, but you want
to like hold your hand over it and feel
[SPEAKER_02]: the heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just trying to melt this hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're using a rig that has a dome
on it, you put the dome over the nail now,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then you put the hash inside of there
directly onto the nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a domeless nail,
don't drop it right down the hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put it in the area around the hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you've got a carb cap, put the carb
cap over it and just inhale as soon as you
[SPEAKER_02]: touch that and you're going to get a nice
fat dab if you did it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we're familiar with the rig,
the nail and the torch and the dabber.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked about a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll explain that a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're also probably going to need like an
oil slick pad or possibly a rig rag or
[SPEAKER_02]: some sort of dab pad.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have some residual
leftover dabs on your dabber after a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of dabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: A dab pad, a 710 dab pad is a good place
to wipe that on.
[SPEAKER_02]: An oil slick pad or a slab pad is also an
excellent place for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: A slab pad is also a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: It keeps your rigs safe from the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a rig rag is also handy, but it's not
as classy as the other two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just something to wipe that excess dabbage
off of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, you may see the email coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The email is the electric nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a bunch of different brands
available lately, but most of them do the
[SPEAKER_02]: same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The email is basically the electric nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: It plugs into the wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a little box.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of them look like a small,
like a piece of musical gear or a small
[SPEAKER_02]: amplifier or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks just like my little Focusrite
audio interface here is about what most of
[SPEAKER_02]: them look like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little box with a couple switches on it
and then a cord coming out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the cord attaches to a nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people are using the highly educated
Infiniti nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you put this heat element onto your
nail and that sits on the rig and it
[SPEAKER_02]: always stays hot at the perfect
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could drop that down to a nice low
temp.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can set your dab on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you throw the carb cap up on top of
that and you let it sit for just half a
[SPEAKER_02]: second.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you start dabbing it and you
really get a nice flavored, perfect heat
[SPEAKER_02]: dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does make me over dab a little bit,
honestly, when I have it sitting on the
table.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tend to take extra dabs because I don't
have to sit there and heat the nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you're having a social gathering
and there are a lot of dabs going around,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's really helpful because I find the
torch to be slightly abrasive when there's
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're balling, get yourself an
e-nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's worth the cost in butane alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll save so much butane from heating up
the rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people talk about hitting a vape
pen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to piss a lot of people off
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: A pen hit is not a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not dabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool for if you're at the movie
theater or maybe it's cool for your
[SPEAKER_02]: girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just get a rig and take a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we should have a basic understanding of
what dabs are.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should know what the gear is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should know how to handle your dabs by
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like there's only one thing left
to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's take a fat dab together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to put a nice sticky dab of some
shatter onto this highly educated carb cap
[SPEAKER_02]: with the dabber on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the flat tip the best I've learned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'm going to grab my torch here and
I'm going to heat up the nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: This nail, I usually have to give it about
a 10 or 12 count.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to hold it away from the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually go one, two, three, four.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you guys can count to 12,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it should be getting pretty close.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That gets me about there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell that it's hot enough by looking
at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see that it's slightly getting
orange.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it cool for just a brief moment here
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's where I take a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a dab with me, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm going to cough for a couple of
seconds and then we'll come back and
[SPEAKER_02]: answer a couple of Twitter questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, don't be afraid to cough and turn red
and sweat and shit after your first couple
[SPEAKER_02]: of dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We expect that of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not choking a cough and you're
not taking big enough dabs, give me a
[SPEAKER_02]: minute to get my shit together and we'll
come back and work on these Twitter
[SPEAKER_02]: questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope everybody survived their dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get to these Twitter questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said earlier that I was going to answer
the question, why do I use such a small
[SPEAKER_02]: rig?
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody saw me post an Instagram little
clip and I was using a little tiny mad rob
[SPEAKER_02]: rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like a little tiny rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: The purpose of a large bong is so that you
could fill it up with smoke and then pull
[SPEAKER_02]: the carb and then you get all that smoke
at once.
[SPEAKER_02]: With a dab, you're just taking a little
tiny dab and you don't really want to fill
[SPEAKER_02]: it with smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just want to get that smoke to your
head.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a little rig takes less sucking and
less air.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I had a great big rig, a great big
bong, I'd have to suck all that air
[SPEAKER_02]: through to try to get that dab through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just feels like I'm sucking a lot of
air because you can't fill it up with
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can only get so much dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you're not going to carve it
because it's hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hot as shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The nail is really hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I use a small rig because I
don't want to smoke air.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to smoke a fat dab right to my
face.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want just enough water to cool it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need a whole lot of special
percolation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a basic perk is cool with me because
I just need that to cool it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to get really filtered like
you do with your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to over filter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to cool it down, punch it right to
my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I use a small rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another question was about dab size and
how much hash am I smoking?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not me myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much hash are people smoking in a dab?
[SPEAKER_02]: How much is what's a serving size or a
dose?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd start off with about a sesame seed
size dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a piece of rice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a piece of rice is probably about
0.02 of a gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the average medical patient or the
average dab consumer is going to take
[SPEAKER_02]: about a 0.02 to maybe a 0.1 would be kind
of a larger dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: But some people take up to 0.2 or 0.25
just depends on what you're getting into
[SPEAKER_02]: and how big you like to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a little bit of math.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are 28 grams in an ounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you get a 20% return that turns
into 5.6 grams of hash, basically smoking
[SPEAKER_02]: a 0.2 dab is the equivalent of smoking one
gram of herb in one hit by yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can go anywhere from 0.2 or 0.02
all the way up to 0.2 with your dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done a gram before, but I wouldn't
recommend it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: My lungs are still fucked up from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They never will be the same, I don't
think, from taking too large of a dab
[SPEAKER_02]: several times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just once, but I did it over and over
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I hurt myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing to think about is it takes a
lot more heat to heat up a big fat dab
[SPEAKER_02]: than it does to heat up a little dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just take a bunch of little dabs and it
requires a little bit less heat and your
[SPEAKER_02]: lungs don't get all that heat in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I say that, but then I look over at
my dabber and I've got a big gigantic dab
[SPEAKER_02]: sitting there waiting for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take a big dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll answer one more Twitter question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we're going to give thanks and start
wrapping up the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you guys enjoyed that dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sure did.
[SPEAKER_02]: My last question from Twitter is,
what is with this 710?
[SPEAKER_02]: What does 710 mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, 710 is nice and simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you turn the number 710 upside down,
it spells the word oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've been listening, oil is all about
the dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: In one of my early episodes, I mentioned
that if somebody sent me a tweet,
[SPEAKER_02]: with who coined the phrase 710,
that I would send them some stickers as a
[SPEAKER_02]: prize.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody actually tweeted me the correct
answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it was on Instagram, but you sent
the correct answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just need to give me your mailing
address so that I can send you those
[SPEAKER_02]: stickers.
[SPEAKER_02]: The correct answer was Task Rock and the
guys from Healthstone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we're going to give thanks and then
we're going to wrap up the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: This episode we're going to give thanks to
my friend Big D, Daniel Desai.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think the hash movement and the
710 community could be where it is today
[SPEAKER_02]: without the help of Big D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big D was the founder of Top Shelf
Extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a Cannabis Cup winner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big D actually gave me my very first real
dab at the Cannabis Cup at the Broadway
[SPEAKER_02]: Wellness booth when we had the first cup
here in Denver at the X-Dough.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wouldn't be the dabber I am today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't be able to give you this info
today without the inspiration and the help
[SPEAKER_02]: from Big D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big D is the host of the Secret Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Secret Cup is a secret, so I'm not
going to tell you too much about it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it is a dab competition.
[SPEAKER_02]: They host regional competitions.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have finals and then they also have
the national championships.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a hash competition, but it's a
secret.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going on right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big D is in California working his ass
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you get to hear this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big thanks, much love.
[SPEAKER_02]: One year for 710, Big D hosted an event
called the Dabs of Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had a bunch of raffle items to give
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: He sold raffle tickets.
[SPEAKER_02]: He threw a big fat show at the Oriental
Theater where we were able to dab out and
[SPEAKER_02]: have a real community event.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were a bunch of people there that
night and there was also a huge raffle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big D donated all the proceeds to a local
care center so that they could buy a van
[SPEAKER_02]: to get all of the disabled folks to their
doctor's appointments to make their lives
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just one example of the awesome
things that Big D does for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a big guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a big heart, so we want to give
him a big thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: We love you, Big D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much thanks from the I Grow Culture Show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the entire 710 community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big thanks to Big D.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I want to thank everybody for
joining me for the dab episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a short episode this time,
but it's just me, so it makes it easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys don't want to listen to me for a
full hour.
