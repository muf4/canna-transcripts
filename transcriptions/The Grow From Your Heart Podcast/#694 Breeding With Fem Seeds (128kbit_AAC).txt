[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen and you know I
[SPEAKER_00]: do include a link in the show notes and in
the video description to make it nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: easy for all of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode will come out right after
Thanksgiving, Indigenous Peoples Day,
[SPEAKER_00]: Black Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will actually come out on Cyber Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everybody had a great holiday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you had a good feast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you had a good walk with your
cousin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to tell everybody big thanks
for all of the support on the Black Friday
[SPEAKER_00]: sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, we put out a couple of new
strains and if you were looking for those
[SPEAKER_00]: new strains on Black Friday and you had a
problem finding them, that is because they
[SPEAKER_00]: sold out almost instantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, they dropped it 420 on most
of the vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: By 430, most of them were sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people were sending me
messages asking where and how to get those
[SPEAKER_00]: new drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize, they went quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are being restocked by the time this
episode comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the vendors should be replenished
with the new drops of Saka Souffle in the
[SPEAKER_00]: machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check the website, check the vendor
links.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to find those new packs
in stock somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were looking for the machine and
Saka Souffle on Black Friday and you were
[SPEAKER_00]: unable to get those, I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they should be back in stock now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, check that vendor list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check the websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to find Saka Souffle
and the machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I do have one more thing to cover
before we get to the main topic of this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show is approaching 10,000 YouTube
subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal for this podcast for the end of
the year is to reach 10,000 YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, all I want for Christmas is 10,000
YouTube subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are listening on an audio platform,
I do invite you to come subscribe to the
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come check out the cool 4K video editing
I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got two cameras going.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both 4K.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it looks pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: See my cool background, my lighting,
check out my fancy table setup here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I do invite you to come subscribe
to the YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're watching and you haven't
subscribed already, now is the time please
[SPEAKER_00]: click that little red subscribe button,
click on the notification bell.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, every time I put out a new
episode, you'll get a notification and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll never miss an episode of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's jump into the main topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question came from the iReGenetics
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a grow question,
you can visit the iReGenetics website.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply click on that tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will ask you a few preliminary
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are asking a plant specific
question or a problem specific question,
[SPEAKER_00]: those preliminary questions will help me
kind of diagnose your problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me some details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what's going on in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then at the bottom, it does give you the
opportunity to type out in detail what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on and ask your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was not a plant specific question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a breeding question that came from
our friend, Laser King, and it goes a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Rasta Jeff, when you have
feminized seeds and you make feminized F2,
[SPEAKER_00]: will you have the same genetic diversity
as in regular F2 seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of things to unpack to
get to the answer to that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friend is asking about feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't understand FEM seeds,
I've done several episodes on feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a full podcast about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you type in grow from your heart
podcast, feminized seeds, it will come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a good basis for feminized
seeds, a good base education.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friend has apparently has feminized
seeds or is thinking about breeding with
[SPEAKER_00]: FEM seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've got, so when you make a batch
of seeds, that first batch, we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: call it for the sake of this question
here, we're going to call it an F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you take two strains that are not on
similar parents and you cross them,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have now made an F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably made a poly hybrid,
but that's just details to talk about in
[SPEAKER_00]: the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to say for this question,
you've made an F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've taken a plant and reversed it
and used that pollen to put onto a
[SPEAKER_00]: different plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we have made an F1 that is
feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may also be called an S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could also be called an R1.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of those labels and people are
going to those are kind of made up labels
[SPEAKER_00]: by the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are kind of bastardizing all of these
labels for the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think S and R were kind of made up by
the industry to indicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about what an S and an R
are, because that will help us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we are reversing plants, when I'm
making feminized seeds, we are reversing a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking a female plant and treating it
with a solution to cause that plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: create pollen, which will all be female
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we put that pollen on a another
female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if I take, let's just say Golden
Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat is a really good place to
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I take a Golden Goat female plant and
reverse it and make pollen out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat, I can either put that pollen
on another Golden Goat female,
[SPEAKER_00]: or I can put that pollen on any other
female in my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I put that feminized pollen from Golden
Goat onto Golden Goat, I have done what is
[SPEAKER_00]: called selfing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant has selfed itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may be crass, but you will never
forget it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant just fucked itself and made
babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're never going to forget that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a little crass, but it is in your
brain forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is S, self, selfed itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is Golden Goat to Golden Goat,
nothing but Golden Goat S1 in that
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to find anything but
Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may find some recessive traits from
the Golden Goat parents and grandparents,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's no adulteration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just Golden Goat genetics in that
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were to take that Golden Goat pollen
and put it on any other plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is going to be labeled an R plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: R is for reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number that follows that will be your
generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be an R1 and R2, but in this case,
we're just going to say R1.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I make that pollen and put
it on a different plant, the seeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: come out of that are now labeled an R1.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a reversal one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an F1, but to be friendly and to
give more information, a breeder would be
[SPEAKER_00]: polite if they labeled that as an S1 or an
R1, which would indicate that it is
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized and it would let you know a
little bit of how it has been created and
[SPEAKER_00]: worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is why we use more specific labels
other than F1, S1, R1.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've talked about the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it were a regular seed, it would be an
F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was not feminized, it'd be an F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we're working with fems,
we get S1s and R1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me catch myself back up on my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The original question is, are we going to
have the same genetic diversity as in
[SPEAKER_00]: regular F2 seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: That genetic diversity will be dictated by
a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, was the original plant a
self plant or a reversed plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the second question is,
are you putting that pollen on the same
[SPEAKER_00]: plant or a different plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I'm asking that is because
that is going to unlock different
[SPEAKER_00]: potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are more ingredients going into the
pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I've got golden goat and I'm only
putting golden goat to golden goat,
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% golden goat, I'm going to get
probably 75 to 80% of my phenotypes are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be very golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those other phenotypes,
the other 25, 20-ish percent are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: look like the parents that created golden
goat and possibly the grandparents that
[SPEAKER_00]: created those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little bit unlikely, but it is
possible when you're working with
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do see the history when you're making
things, but we're not going to see any
[SPEAKER_00]: other genetics other than the ingredients
that were in that pie that make golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat, but it's going to be very golden
goat dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about if I took a golden
goat and pollinated, let's just say lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk and made lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got the opportunity to see the
parents of the golden goat and also the
[SPEAKER_00]: parents of the lemon Jeffrey in that
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got two different ingredients,
so we've got more options for more
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time we're going to see a
beautiful 50-50 mix of golden goat and
[SPEAKER_00]: lemon skunk, which is a beautiful
phenotype of the lemon Jeffrey,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're going to see leaners toward the
golden goat and you're going to see
[SPEAKER_00]: leaners toward the lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is going to depend on which plant
is more dominant in the genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: which traits take over.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be recessive traits, there'll be
dominant traits, there'll be co-dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which traits in your plants win in that
mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you just put all these
ingredients in a bowl and you shook them
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one's got more flavor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one's going to win in that mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which flavor?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are so many other things to
think about when it comes to breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor, the aromas, the buzz,
and the appearance are all things we can
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly identify, but you've also got to
think about how does it grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it resistant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there resistance to pests and pathogens
and problems and stress?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are very important things to think
about, but I'm kind of getting off topic
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing we're going to see is the
parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see the golden goat and
the lemon skunk and then you may see a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of the golden goat parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Romulan, island sweet skunk,
Hawaiian sativa in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see some of those traits pop up in
the lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some sort of skunk and some sort
of lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know exactly what made the
lemon skunk, but you're going to see
[SPEAKER_00]: traits of those parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, a lot of the things,
if I reverse golden goat, I can identify
[SPEAKER_00]: the golden goat traits in it and then I
can identify the traits that come from the
[SPEAKER_00]: other plants very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lemon Jeffrey, that spacey spacious
between the nodes at spacious growth
[SPEAKER_00]: between the nodes that directly comes from
the lemon skunk that crazy wicked potency
[SPEAKER_00]: that comes directly from the golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of depends on the dominance of
the traits in which plant you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let me get myself back on track and
focus a little bit because the question is
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically about S2 or F2 with feminine
seeds and will we see the same genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity as in as within an F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my experience, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you make F2s of regular seeds,
the F2 is when you find the wild
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity, the wild variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is called transgressive
segregation or recessive segregation.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those words is accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody tell me, because I just pulled
that out of the sky randomly and there are
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of words in my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those is accurate, but it's the the
segregation word.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we find offspring that outperform the
original parents, that's when you see
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the F2s will show what they look like
in the wild variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see a lot of things that look like the
mom, a lot of things that look like the
[SPEAKER_00]: dad, a lot of things that are 50-50.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we see a lot of crazy grandparent
traits get brought out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking to find some of the
older stuff in the line, you can kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: find that in the F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it will represent itself or
present itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you find the F3 and breed those
together and wash all that old stuff out
[SPEAKER_00]: and start narrowing it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the process for there.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the feminine seed, you don't really
bring out all that old stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are kind of locking it in even
tighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I have noticed when you do make
the feminized S2s, sometimes you can make
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of weaker spindly plants that don't
perform as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you really lock in super traits
and have very uniform plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That S2 will come out almost like an F4
and F5 with the uniformity if you've done
[SPEAKER_00]: proper selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, a lot of this will be based very
much on the plants which you select,
[SPEAKER_00]: the dominance of the genes which you're
using.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since you're using feminized seeds and
doing that, the Ss, the S1s, and only and
[SPEAKER_00]: not doing Rs, you've got the good
opportunity of locking in the traits that
[SPEAKER_00]: you really want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's all about phenotypical selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I have noticed is that different
phenotypes of the same strain will react
[SPEAKER_00]: differently when they are feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a plant and we'll just say number
nine and number four were both reversed
[SPEAKER_00]: and self to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And number nine was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number four was trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the seeds that came out of there
showed me garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not like what they represented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number nine was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite plant that came out of the S1s
of number nine, I made S2s of those and
[SPEAKER_00]: that got labeled, if I start talking
numbers, I'll reveal what it is because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's known as number 77.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number 77 had problems being reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so dominant and so female that I
could not reverse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to really spray the shit out of it,
start spraying it early to get it to
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the original question is will I see the
same genetic diversity in the F2s?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they're going to be, in my opinion,
they'll be much more locked down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was rambling about how the F2s in
regular seeds bring up that wild genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The feminized F2s kind of lock it in
really tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to see much diversity at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be more like an F3 or an F4
of regular seeds and it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very uniform if you have selected
the correct phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, number nine was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number four did not want to be F2ed in any
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I kind of hinted at this a moment ago,
but think of breeding a little bit as
[SPEAKER_00]: chefing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every ingredient you put in is going to
add to the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now think about portions of those
ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I add one portion of one thing,
my meal tastes or my mix, my final product
[SPEAKER_00]: tastes like that one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I put in golden goat, it tastes like
golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is only golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I put in some lemon skunk, now probably
I'm going to get 50% lemon skunk,
[SPEAKER_00]: 50% golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we shake it up, you got to think
about like there's going to be the edges
[SPEAKER_00]: of the pan or the edges of the cookie
sheet or however, that's where your
[SPEAKER_00]: outliers are going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right in the middle is going to be your
regular shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then outliers are going to be out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to find some weirdos out
there, but most of your flavors are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be 50-50.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's think about if we're breeding
feminized plants to itself again,
[SPEAKER_00]: you just added more golden goat to the
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're just doubling up on the golden
goat flavor, making it super golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that one is going to have that one
batch of pie or that one cake is double
[SPEAKER_00]: golden goats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now whatever you breed to that,
it's going to be two golden goats to
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you breed it to, technically just
because of the breeding that you've done,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've locked in that golden goat trait so
hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of think about it as if we filled the
pan with golden goat, you're only going to
[SPEAKER_00]: take golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we filled the pan with 50% golden
goat and 50% lemon skunk and blend it
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now right in the middle, there is going to
be a beautiful blend of 50% lemon skunk,
[SPEAKER_00]: 50-50 lemon skunk and golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe on the outer edges, maybe we didn't
blend it too well, you're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: some that's a little more golden goat,
some that's a little more lemon skunk and
[SPEAKER_00]: the opposite on other parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of how breeding works.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to be real basic about it and
compare it to cheffing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I took off on a good ramble on that
one, but the short answer is you will not
[SPEAKER_00]: see as much diversity in the feminized F2
as you would in the regular F2 because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not unlocking that Pandora's box.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my experience and in my opinion,
the phenotypes do come out much more
[SPEAKER_00]: uniform, much more regular and quite a bit
like that original plant that you started
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes though you can create weak and
spindly offspring in the feminized F2,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a lot of the times you do make very
stable, uniform, viable crosses when doing
[SPEAKER_00]: the feminized F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and foes, smokers, growers,
clone cutters and pollen chuckers,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts
out there.
