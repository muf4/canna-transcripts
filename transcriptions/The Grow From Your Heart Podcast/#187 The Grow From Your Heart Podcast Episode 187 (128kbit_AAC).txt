education and conversation.

[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_01]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_01]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this my friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.

offender.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse's back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I hope everybody waved you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope they replied.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope they're in their car and like,
what's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: They said something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope they feel weird now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope they're at public in public with
their headphones on and said some dumb
[SPEAKER_01]: shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, thank you for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, anytime, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're always welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you on the show every other episode
if you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do Mike episode, one episode,
you the next, Mike, you, Mike,
[SPEAKER_01]: you, and then granny occasionally.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could do that.
All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys heard it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're all invited whenever you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lindsay, we'll put you in the mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do some podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of podcasting, I owe a huge shout
out to my friend, Bo Nellis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bo did, Bo hosts a podcast called the
spliff podcast and she gave me the hugest,
[SPEAKER_01]: longest shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was talking about her favorite
cannabis podcasts and I got a lot of love.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not already listening to the
podcast hosted by Bo Nellis, go check that
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: She spells it the, that's the spliff
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's P O T C A S T.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit different cannabis show.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's more like a kindergarten teacher
that takes dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's got a very soothing kindergarten
teacher lady voice, but she's fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: She does a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that she's part of our team in
the cannabis education and podcasting
[SPEAKER_01]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to Bo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen to her, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do an outdoor episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about preparing your
outdoor garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can talk about a whole bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a nice list of things,
but before we get there, I'm going to stop
[SPEAKER_01]: the music.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking about distillate and Jesse
just told me he's tired of distillate.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said he's kind of burned out on
distillate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Burned out on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Burned out.
Huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: What the fuck, dude?
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously?
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to get Terps all the time or
basically free.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also went along with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a bunch of distillate, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you were just now we've got to explain
this to some people because not everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: is a spoiled Colorado hashbrack.
[SPEAKER_01]: The distillate is hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, it is really good hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is in the high 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 95% and above.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen 97s and 98s.
[SPEAKER_01]: 97, 98% THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the ingredient you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the part you it's just going to make
you high as shit, but there's no flavor
[SPEAKER_01]: and there are a lot of things missing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's basically it's the moonshine
equivalent of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great way to put it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have basically distilled off all of
the ingredients into separate containers
[SPEAKER_01]: and they are selling you the THC so that
you can dab that by itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is there's no flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's let me explain why I'm kind of
burned out on it because there's no flavor
[SPEAKER_02]: to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it has like a minty kind of flavor
maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe sometimes a woody popsicle stick
flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've often wondered if that flavor
actually just comes from the machinery
[SPEAKER_02]: that it was made in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never thought of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've noticed that from different labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're different and then some of them
don't have any flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spherex did not have any flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Evo Labs usually doesn't have any flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't tried Evo yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: This brand here, I forgot what they're
called.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a P and a J on the logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pure distillate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pure, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they have a flavor that is very
close to the strain that I have purchased.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a representative flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recognize it a little, but it's not as
strong as it should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're an old school pot smoker.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been smoking weed since...
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, before we should ever admit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoke way more weed than I do Debs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you smoke distillate, you're
missing that terp, the plant flavor,
[SPEAKER_01]: the terps from the hash, the terps from
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're missing all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also when I said I'm kind of
burned out on it, I would rather have like
[SPEAKER_02]: a really good live resin than distillate
personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lately, I like for my medical smoking
reasons and my recreational smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons, both.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want a sativa that gives me energy,
makes my eyes bug out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost makes me feel like I'm on almost
wired, too much caffeine, too much coffee,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe a little slight stimulant,
but I like a dab, almost a psychedelic
[SPEAKER_01]: dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the distillate is the quickest,
easiest way to get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's right to the point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, here's the one that makes your
eyes bug out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too much for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see people take that THC distillate
dab and they just go, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see them panic and turn red
and sweat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've made a few people turn white with
distillates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get pale, blood sugar drops.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't breathe right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can take the hugest dabs of distillate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can take, of the big dabs I can take,
distillates the easiest because it's the
[SPEAKER_02]: cleanest.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I can heat up a banger and let
it cool to just the right temp and just
[SPEAKER_01]: squirt almost half a gram in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't even cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can just pull that half gram like it's
nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I blow out the biggest, thickest,
richest cloud and I don't even cough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen you do one gram dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I bet you could probably do a gram and
a half.
[SPEAKER_02]: A distillate dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done a gram of the distillate and it
was no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a gram and a half might be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I don't know if I'm getting
older or if I am working too much and not
[SPEAKER_01]: resting or if I'm not hydrating or if I've
been dabbing too hard, but my lungs are
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to get tired of the large dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said on one episode, I was like,
it's time to retire the big dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I fucking lied.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing big dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still hang out with Lindsay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still hang out with granny.
[SPEAKER_01]: They love to give me giant dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I go places, people know who I am and
they think it's polite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the kindest thing they can do is just
to give me the biggest dab they can muster
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm so high after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, you fucking just ruined my day,
but I want to be polite and take the dab
[SPEAKER_01]: with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone dabs me out, ruins me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad I have a reputation as a
lightweight dabber.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate getting forced in big dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's oh fuck, ruin your day shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun and terrible at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like that the best struggle ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I'm good at life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got it figured out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not slightly handicap myself?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see if I could do this high out of
my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like playing on the expert level.
[SPEAKER_02]: You beat the video game.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you're going up in difficulty.
[SPEAKER_01]: No guns.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to choke everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: This whole match.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just knives and chokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: No guns.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, distillate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We give a shout out to our friend Bo
Nellis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's time to segue into talking
about growing cannabis outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is probably hopefully going to be
episode one in a series of outdoor grow
[SPEAKER_01]: lessons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I guess there's one more thing I
should mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to save this for another
episode by myself and not steal all the
[SPEAKER_01]: thunder on a dual episode, but I should
announce this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I today, yesterday and today took on the
position of being the grow manager at
[SPEAKER_01]: Three Rivers Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been talking about the project and
the thing I've been doing and keeping it
[SPEAKER_01]: secret.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's been keeping me so damn
busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am the manager now of a large grow
facility in Pueblo West, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three Rivers Organics is a really cool
facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to all my friends and coworkers
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the cool ass management,
everybody that helps us out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's keeping me busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Jesse stays busy all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to do an episode about why we move
from facility to facility so frequently
[SPEAKER_01]: and why, why that happens in this
industry, because people probably don't
[SPEAKER_01]: understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to write that down actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could get a couple other people in
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually think I'm in a long-term home
where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even think I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know when you work somewhere and you
know that one day you're going to have to
[SPEAKER_01]: just get your shit and leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have, there's that like employee
cubby area and the employee fridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't leave your shit in the fridge
when you leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, I got to get my Tupperware
because I don't know if I'm going to come
[SPEAKER_01]: back tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: My last two grow facilities where I
worked, I had that feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, any day I might just say,
fuck it, not even come here because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not a hundred percent legit for what I'm
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not satisfied.
[SPEAKER_01]: This place, I've got stuff in the cubby
hole at work right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I feel like it is, it's going to be a
long-term thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They keep me happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They listen to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're not, the owners know
they're not pot growers and they don't try
[SPEAKER_01]: to be pot growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the important things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the hardest part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're business owners.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a job in itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do payroll and manage a business and I'll
manage the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they respect that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They see that I've got the girl under
control and I know that I don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck with payroll and we all respect our
boundary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to do a whole episode about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's save some of that for a whole
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about growing weed outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was the other thing I wanted to
mention you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we're so busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this will be the start of a series,
hopefully, but I am now the manager of a
[SPEAKER_01]: large facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a crew to manage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got other people to answer to
facility wise when the owners are like,
[SPEAKER_01]: how many pounds are coming?
[SPEAKER_01]: When's it coming?
[SPEAKER_01]: What strains do we got?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much of this do we need to order?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a lot of shit to handle now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to be a little busier,
but we're going to keep the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just going to be harder for Jesse and
I to time each other out to get to the
[SPEAKER_01]: series we want to do, but it's going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got faith in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this episode is going to be about
outdoor preparation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to talk too much about all
of the things you need to do during the
[SPEAKER_01]: season.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about how to be
prepared because I think preparing is
[SPEAKER_01]: probably like a good 50% of the battle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll make or break you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the most important thing and it's
the thing people overlook the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a plan, you guys, just because
you're growing outdoors and it's basically
[SPEAKER_01]: free.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got space and the time,
it's damn near free.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have to buy- If you're
doing just a few plants, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get carried away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get greedy because it's free.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you grow three small plants that nobody
can see, you've got way more chance of
[SPEAKER_01]: getting away with that than growing one
giant fucking plant that everybody can
[SPEAKER_01]: see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get greedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, this is meant to be medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: This wasn't put here on this earth to be a
profit plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was put here to be a medicine for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think about that when you're growing
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm skipping ahead, but don't fucking
shoot anybody for your weed, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're stealing your weed,
don't shoot them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the number one rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't shoot them for weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That looks bad on us.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're that down to- If you want to go
out there and fight them, you can fight
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm cool with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please don't kill anybody for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they shoot at you first, too,
I mean, by all means, defend yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you feel capable of doing such
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you want to just fucking run when
they shoot, go for it and let them have
[SPEAKER_01]: your pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably the best thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: To give them the weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're going to shoot at you,
if they're down to kill you for that weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: let them have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You better, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They probably want it a little more than
you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You better damn sure, make sure they
really want to kill you and you only got a
[SPEAKER_02]: few seconds to think about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not feel like any seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a live or die thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shoot or don't shoot and that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please don't kill anybody for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant doesn't want that bad karma on
it either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to read the word marijuana
grow and murder.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I hate doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want those things in the paper
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody comes in your house,
do whatever the fuck you have to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outdoors, just let them take that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow more next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my opinion on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get to something less grim.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made a little outline here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We made an outline.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel that location is super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the first things to think
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Location.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your goal with this grow and find
a location that fits that goal or make
[SPEAKER_01]: your location suit your needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't overload your location.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't get too carried away.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to bust off your 99 plant
extended plant count in your backyard,
[SPEAKER_02]: in your suburban area.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to fail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I promise.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually a dude that lives on the
East side of Pueblo that every year he
[SPEAKER_01]: just walks to his backyard and throws a
handful of seeds and post pictures of it
[SPEAKER_01]: to the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's amazing that he doesn't get
in trouble for it, but he does the way too
[SPEAKER_01]: many plants outside thing and it's a
jungle mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to be cleaned up, put them in
some pots, control it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think it's amazing that he does
that and posts those pictures and gets
[SPEAKER_01]: away with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about location.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want somewhere that is safe and
secure.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I mean by safe and secure?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want anybody getting into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote down cops.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need it safe and secure from cops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's legal where you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either way, the cannabis cannot be seen by
anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody driving by can see it,
you are now illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, thieves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be safe and secure from
thieves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people are good, honest people until
they see big, fat, shiny buds with no one
[SPEAKER_01]: watching them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pot plants turn honest people into
douchebags real fucking quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's few things I've seen that do that
to people quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing I want you to make sure that
will not ever come in contact with your
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plants is children.
[SPEAKER_01]: If young kids are walking to school,
to the park, through your neighborhood and
[SPEAKER_01]: they pass by your cannabis crop and they
decide to steal a bud, you just fucked up
[SPEAKER_01]: bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please don't let that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is one of the biggest things that
Colorado is afraid of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's all worried about the children.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about the children?
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep your pot plants away from the
children, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember reading a story about that in
the Denver Post several years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a show a long time ago on TV.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like weed cops.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was basically cops, but all they were
doing was going to weed grows and places.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them, they got in trouble because
the kids pulled a couple of buds off of a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant on their way to school and took it
to school and was showing it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, look what I got.
[SPEAKER_01]: The teacher's like, where'd you get that?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, I just pulled it off the plant
on the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cops came and they're like,
show us where?
[SPEAKER_01]: That kid was like, here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They knocked on the door and they busted
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, dude, you got plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually where I saw that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It happened up in somewhere up in Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was definitely the fucking idiot had
that shit planted like right next to a
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking jogging trail behind like a four
foot fucking privacy fence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that when we talk about location that
is safe and secure, that's a fucking fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a perfect example of what not to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can have an outdoor grow that is
not enclosed, I recommend buying a dog
[SPEAKER_01]: run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to Lowe's and get the 10 by 10 dog run.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a 10 by 10 area.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is six or eight feet tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Build that shit to the best of your
ability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put a lock on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now your cannabis is pretty safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those, those dog runs are highly
modifiable.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do, and you can put two of them
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can put three of them together.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do all kinds of crazy shit with
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would work really well if you got the
10 by 10 pre-built dog run and the
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-made eight by eight greenhouse and
just put the eight by eight greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: inside the 10 by 10 dog run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're super compliant with the
law in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were in a greenhouse and you were
locked and secured.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cute.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then put your dog inside of that 10 by
10 run and just make them run around the
[SPEAKER_01]: grow all day, not inside of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then no one get in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like having a moat or a goat or a
crocodile.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said moat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking goat before you said moat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is going to be a fun podcast or
already is a fun podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Goats are fucking scary, especially the
big ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never male goats, I should say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the goats I've interacted with have
been in a pen, so I've never had to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel threatened.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always an offense.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So safe, secure from cops, thieves,
and children.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please do not let the kids get a hold of
your weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also think about your location.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it legal?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a legal grow area,
make sure if you want to, I encourage you
[SPEAKER_01]: to find out all of the rules for outdoor
growing in your county, in your local
[SPEAKER_01]: area, and follow them to the best of your
ability.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way, if something goes wrong and
the cops show up at your house,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can say, rule A, followed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rule B, followed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a dickhead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to grow medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to help myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do your due diligence.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's not legal where you are,
I cannot encourage you to grow outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please follow the rules, all that stuff
that I'm supposed to say legally.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you do choose to grow outdoor like
a fucking adult, because you can do that,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're an adult, wherever you are,
be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't have your plants visible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep them below the fence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Camouflage them some way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow some other plants around them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't tell anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, all those if you're growing in an
illegal area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you are growing in an illegal area,
don't do it at your house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't grow in your backyard illegally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go find somewhere in the forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't take your girlfriend with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't take your best friend with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't take anybody with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody that that relationship can end and
somebody can be salty for you,
[SPEAKER_01]: don't take them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't need to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little tip though.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you aren't growing on your property,
it's really hard for them to convict you
[SPEAKER_02]: if you do happen to get busted.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to have film of you going there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even that's hard to hold up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you could have just driven past.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't take law advice from two dudes with
beards at my table though.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not legal advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's illegal advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's illegal where you are,
be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be careful with your pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of pictures have GPS tracking in
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's geotagging in your pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: That stuff just incriminates you too if
you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't take your cell phone because it's a
tracking device.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were growing, you guys do not grow
on federal land.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people back in the day loved to
grow in national forests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will get caught.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an extra crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were growing on federal land.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're extra pissed off.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to make an example of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to fuck with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't take your phone with you to the grow
if you're growing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a GPS tracking device.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't take pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: There if you do, be very careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't tell anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've said that three or four times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't tell anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just reiterating that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't hint of where it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find another excuse of why you're
disappearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't even tell them, I have to go water
my grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to take my mom to church.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just find a good reason to be gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are finding somewhere to grow and
it's outdoors, whether it's a legal or
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal spot, if it's your backyard or if
it's down by the creek, shout out to my
[SPEAKER_01]: buddy James, you need to be able to get
water there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a lot of water in the beginning,
but it's going to get hot in the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to get 90 degrees everywhere
this summer in America, in North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need to be getting a lot
of water to that grow very frequently,
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly every single day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure you can get water there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you've got, if you're doing it a
big outdoor grow far from your house,
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to get water in a vehicle to that
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Legally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not get pulled over, not get trailed
with a bunch of water up a mountainside
[SPEAKER_01]: and then come back with no water.
[SPEAKER_01]: No water and no excuse.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're doing a large outdoor grow,
I highly recommend irrigation system.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will reduce the amount of water that
you need that you consume.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's well designed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can probably only do that in a legal
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to be setting up too much
irrigation and pumps and toys in an
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be very careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's a trick on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to Lowe's and they have the irrigation
experts and they actually it's a pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: good, what they use is a pretty good
program that can quickly design an
[SPEAKER_02]: irrigation system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Draw your plants out on a grid and tell
them that they're cherry trees and just
[SPEAKER_02]: put square plants for your little grid and
tell them you need two irrigation heads at
[SPEAKER_02]: each one of the plants and they can
totally design it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll give you a part list and
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to do an episode on building
an irrigation and drip system and I had no
[SPEAKER_01]: thought of modifying it for outdoor use in
my plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just made that episode a little bit
longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's next on the list.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, we keep getting more interesting
shit to talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little more to outdoor
irrigation systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: But mostly just because of the materials
difference you're using because it needs
[SPEAKER_02]: to be more rigid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Better PVC, thicker tubing, longer lasting
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think about getting water to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about building yourself an
irrigation system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's something that is more applicable
to the backyard environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Space for plants, room for plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about how big your plants are going
to grow and make sure you give them plenty
[SPEAKER_01]: of space apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want them touching.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they start touching, they know it and
they'll stop growing wider.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, oh, I don't want to touch
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to touch you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to grow up and they're going to
quit going out because they don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: smother each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they do smother each other is when
you start getting powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the bugs hide.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where you get bug mold or bud mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So give them plenty of space.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very, when you plant these plants in
the late spring, or early summer and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're just little tiny plants,
it's hard to imagine how big they're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're doing it right, they're
going to get fucking gigantic,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially if you're planting out like
late April or very early May, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: here in Southern Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the early shoulder of the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by the time they start flowering in
late July, they are going to be,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, depending on how well you plant
everything out, they'll be fucking huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 feet tall, literally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like planting plants on like six or
eight foot centers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I was going to say is six or
eight foot centers, which means that plant
[SPEAKER_01]: needs six feet for itself to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want that plant's going to be six feet
around itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to put another plant next
to it, you want a foot gap and then
[SPEAKER_01]: another six foot space for that plant,
at least a foot gap, maybe two,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you want to walk through it and
carry a five gallon bucket to water it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So leave yourself space.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't underestimate the growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be amazing, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this is your first outdoor grow,
you're going to be blown away.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're growing behind a six foot fence,
if you plant really early, the plant is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to go over the fence.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to learn to either
tie it down or create an outdoor trellis
[SPEAKER_01]: or plant a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trim it or many things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't recommend extending the fence up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen people do that and it's always a
red flag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody that is a ripper knows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody that's a grower knows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone that works with the DEA knows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone that lives in Colorado knows or
we've caught on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see all that shit all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so make sure you have plenty of
room for your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next thing I want to talk about is
don't plant your plants between the
[SPEAKER_01]: garage, the fence, the back of the house
and the shed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put them in an open area where you can get
airflow, where you can get wind,
[SPEAKER_01]: where you can get sunshine, where you
don't have too much shade.
[SPEAKER_01]: What side of the mountain do we want to
plan on?
[SPEAKER_01]: If we had owned a mountain, do you want to
be on the east or south facing slope?
[SPEAKER_01]: Plan on the southern facing slope if you
can, if you've got a mountain.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where you're going to get the most
sunshine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll want to also plan on the south side
of the buildings and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always the south side of anything in
this hemisphere is the sunniest part of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't plan on the north side of the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in the backyard, you're going to
have to deal with what you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to get on the south side so that
you're not getting shadows all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to get those plants where they get as
much sunshine as they can.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the minute the sun comes up,
to the minute the sun goes down,
[SPEAKER_01]: those plants can eat up all the sunshine
you can give them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't over-sun a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you feel like it's getting burned,
something else is going on, unless you
[SPEAKER_02]: just put it outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That first few days maybe, and then it'll
pull out hopefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like if you had outdoor plants that
had a problem, hypothetically if it were
[SPEAKER_01]: feasible, you could just carry them
outside and put them under the sun for
[SPEAKER_01]: four or five days and they'll heal
themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll go, oh, that's what I was missing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen that happen a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've used that trick a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't like taking them back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I just brought in every bug in
the neighborhood when I do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually feel like they get cleaner when
they go outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bugs are like, oh, cool nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on your local.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've just got a bunch of dirt in your
backyard and you don't have grass or
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetables and there's no beneficial life
back there anyways, it's a different
[SPEAKER_02]: story.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I do it, it's at one of two places
that is very thriving fauna.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a farm boy, so I'm sure everything
is just flourishing where you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sun is king is my point, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure those plants get enough sun,
plenty of sun, all of the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want more.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're like, it's getting enough and
it's shaded, it wants more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can take it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing, if you plant on north sides
of buildings, the northeast side of a
[SPEAKER_02]: building is going to be the darkest side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or just the northeast side of anything is
going to be the darkest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Planning in that can actually cause your
plants to bloom early.
[SPEAKER_02]: All kinds of weird stuff will happen
because the building is going to start
[SPEAKER_02]: blocking off light at a certain period of
the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once the light gets below a certain
intensity, even though the sun may still
[SPEAKER_02]: be up, it's off to the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That can trigger flowering, which may be
something, depending on your situation,
[SPEAKER_02]: you might be able to use that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use that to your advantage, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just something to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep that in mind when you're watching
that plant and trying to judge your
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest window.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to change everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the opposite side of that, I wrote down
streetlights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try not to plant your plants directly
under streetlights.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend Henry, a few years ago,
plants outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: He called me over.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, dude, it should be done and
look at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was still, the pistols are all bright
white.
[SPEAKER_01]: The calyxes aren't fluffy yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at it going, what the fuck is
going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought, look straight up above you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked up, there's a streetlight
directly above these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the sun sets, that streetlight comes
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those plants never got a dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've learned through the years,
it does have to be pretty damn close to
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that they're using LED streetlights in
a lot of places, they don't even affect
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy was in a smaller city and I'm
sure he had the old antique HPS.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was using a grow light for a
streetlight, basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a problem growing somewhere with a
streetlight years ago in a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't finish and we actually had one
herm really bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll do that because of the light.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was also a combination from a security
light.
[SPEAKER_02]: A grow happened at that place again this
last summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Security lights gone and the streetlight
across the street's an LED light and they
[SPEAKER_02]: had no problems whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best solution for the streetlight,
if you can't plant somewhere else,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably a pellet gun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably the way to solve that
problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been so much illegal advice given
in this episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are not lawyers and- Oh, it's because
it's episode 187.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stepping and getting gangsta.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked about where to grow your
plants and where not to grow your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outdoors, lots of space, somewhere safe,
somewhere with a lot of sunshine and away
[SPEAKER_01]: from streetlights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just thought of something with shooting
out streetlights.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they shoot them out, they're going to
send a man out to fix it and he's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: go up in a cherry picker and he'll be able
to see all the backyards around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the backyards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wrong idea, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bad fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even going to edit that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to admit that I fucked
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't shoot out the streetlights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You touched on this a second ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Timing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Timing is crucial in everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Estimated date to put the plants outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in Colorado, late April,
early May, if you want them to not grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: monstrous, you can wait until the
beginning of June.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grow at several places outdoors
typically in a season or help friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll call it that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've grown in many different locations
and each location has a different start
[SPEAKER_02]: date for varying reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I don't want the plants getting
monstrous, I'll put plants out later in
[SPEAKER_02]: the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they can grow free and get to 12 feet,
16 foot tall, I try to get them out as
[SPEAKER_02]: early as I can, late April.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about your timing based on the
situation where you're going to be growing
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got room for monstrous plants,
be vegging now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start vegging indoors under T5 lights or
under HPS lights or under Gavitas or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just get them going now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing outdoor work this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took clones a month ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're over in two gallon pods right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just getting topped and getting trained.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge, biggest plants I've ever grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the sticks cracked up so they're nice
and knurled.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all legal, so we can just extend the
fence up with the fucking tarps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't talk too much about tarps because I
want to do another episode about light
[SPEAKER_01]: depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's not say tarp too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll teach people too much on accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put the plants outside based on
the size you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want bigger plants, put them out
earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want smaller plants, put them out
later.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can judge that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to grow once or twice
outside to see how amazingly they grow
[SPEAKER_01]: because they take off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, you've never seen growth indoors
like you will see outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something to ... I mean, I think it
probably goes without saying, but more
[SPEAKER_02]: shady advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're growing in a place where size is
an issue, instead of having a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: big plants you may consider according to
your legal laws or local laws and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything, but you can always increase
the amount of plants, more smaller plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Colorado, they're thinking about
limiting us on ... Mike's going to want to
[SPEAKER_01]: do an episode about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to limit our number,
no matter what your medical card says,
[SPEAKER_01]: to either 12 or 18 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means we're going to have to start
growing monsters, monster plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The right grower could do 100 pounds off
12 plants outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are people that just set their phone
down and scratch their heads going,
[SPEAKER_01]: what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: 12 outdoor monsters is ... That's some
serious fucking plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about when to put them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Estimated flowering start date.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, everything we're talking about
on timing is going to be Colorado-based.
[SPEAKER_01]: In California, it's going to be different.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Maine, it's going to be different.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Michigan, it's going to be different.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Kentucky, it'll be different.
[SPEAKER_01]: North or south of the equator is going to
be different.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're talking about is Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We apologize that we're so specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me add to that a little.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where it changes, it doesn't change so
much from east to west.
[SPEAKER_02]: It changes from north to south.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say Albuquerque plants are going to go
into bloom earlier down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you come up the road to Pueblo and
they're going to be a little bit later up
[SPEAKER_02]: to Denver and so on and so forth as you go
north and travel between the poles.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes total sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes complete sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: When should we expect them to flower
around here in Pueblo?
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on strain, anywhere from mid to
late July.
[SPEAKER_02]: Early, mid August for most strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seems like some indicas go faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really wild land race sativas go pretty
early too, but they finish much,
[SPEAKER_02]: much later.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes Golden Goat a long time to kick
into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: She does not want to flower outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, I'm not ready yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flo on the other hand, you're like flower
and Flo's like, I'm done now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flo is a great guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great strain to grow outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can only pick a few to grow
outdoors, the Colorado cut of Flo that
[SPEAKER_01]: goes around is a great outdoor cut to
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: The blueberry, a lot of DJ short stuff
does wonders outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you know what you're doing,
I've never done it, but I understand the
[SPEAKER_02]: principle behind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could actually harvest Flo twice
outdoors with a little bit of that tarp
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, but that's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: DJ talks about doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can figure it out indoors,
you can do it outdoors, just extend your
[SPEAKER_01]: season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tarp talk again.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get to that in another episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know when to put them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know when flowering is going to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since we're starting flowering mid July,
mid August, usually 55 to 65 days from
[SPEAKER_01]: there is going to be our harvest date.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strain dependent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see much more variance in
trichome maturity throughout the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoors that you would indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I look at a plant for ripeness,
I use a scope to look at the top,
[SPEAKER_01]: the middle and the bottom of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just scope around a little bit,
measure with my eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't use too scientific of a method.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look at the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a few of them are kind of amber,
it's time to cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: If none of them are amber, leave the plant
standing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a difference in the top,
the middle and the bottom of the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you do it outdoors, the top of the
plant, the trichomes will be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be brown and the bottom of that
plant still be crystal clear trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little harder to judge when to cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you want to do what Jesse says and
take part of it and wait a couple days
[SPEAKER_01]: while you're trimming and then take the
rest of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's up to you how you do it, but don't be
too discouraged when you see the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just got to pick a date and cut or do
it however you want to stagger that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a huge difference though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually recommend through my years of
experience, I've changed my opinion on
[SPEAKER_02]: this, but I actually recommend a slow
harvest like that because most of the
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor I've seen in my life here in
Southern Colorado gets way too overdried
[SPEAKER_02]: or it'll develop mold issues hanging in
too small of a room or this or that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Easiest way to eliminate all those
problems is just harvest in small chunks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take the top most mature buds off,
stand out the plant, let the middle buds
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest off, go ahead and finish off and
so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take two weeks to harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who gives a shit?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be trimming all that weed
for two weeks anyways and it's going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: overdried by the time you're done trimming
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can catch up and it'll stay moist.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll stay alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do that indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, plants may herm indoors doing
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That stresses them a little bit,
but you're at the last two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's up to you if you want to risk that or
not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indoors it seems like the buds don't
always mature off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you scared the plant,
you pissed it off and it doesn't know what
[SPEAKER_01]: to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, where'd my top go?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually trying to decide which bud
is the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's trying to send hormones to decide
which is now the top, the dominant top to
[SPEAKER_01]: be the king.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's spending too much energy there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They never even skip a beat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, great, we got sunlight now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sun is the king.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sun's god out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why a lot of cultures worship the
sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's move on and talk about,
there's some things to think about,
[SPEAKER_01]: options.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to go from clones or seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going from seed, I hope you have
sex to your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want male plants ending up
outdoors pollinating everybody for the
[SPEAKER_01]: next four miles because there are a lot of
people growing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't fuck up everybody's grow,
please.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should outdoors if your plants are a
decent size and are good health.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Jeff said, I don't recommend doing it
either, but if you do do that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you should be able to tell that the plants
are males long before they go into the
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: That requires checking it every three
days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be diligent about it, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, every three days, if you see ball
sacks instead of little fingers thrown a
[SPEAKER_01]: peace sign, you got boy plants they need
to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ideal way to do that is to run those
seeds indoors, cut a clone from it,
[SPEAKER_01]: flower the clone and see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it shows that it's a female,
keep it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it shows it's a male, toss it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the easiest way to solve that
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you still have the original plant
that you can put outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growing nice and big.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice and bushy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to take the top because I'm going
to top it anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just take that main node right out the
top, make my first clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That becomes either my mother plant or my
throwaway.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love to do it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Decide if you want to grow from seeds or
clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of you don't have access to clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have access to seeds,
growth, whatever you can, do the best you
[SPEAKER_01]: can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just pay attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't know where your source of
your clones came from, pay attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to pay attention very
closely unless you trust your clone
[SPEAKER_01]: source.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds, same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that some people will send you
shitty seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people will send you amazing seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to have some
expectations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Know what you're trying to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Know what you've got coming out of those
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Know if you've got an indica or a sativa
or a 70-day or a 50-day strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Know if you need a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or an F1 or an F2 or a polyhybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do some research before you order your
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do a whole episode on that
too, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing you're going to have to
think about is do you want to grow your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants in pots with soil above the ground
or do you want to dig holes in the ground
[SPEAKER_01]: and put your plants directly into the
soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something to think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to do that, you need to
think about your soil or your whole size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either way, you need to think about what
kind of soil you're going to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use bottled nutrients in an
outdoor grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that something you want to do or do you
want to mix up Jesse's secret recipe that
[SPEAKER_01]: he's going to share with us on probably
the next episode on mixing soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to use a soil recipe to where
all you got to do is feed it with water
[SPEAKER_01]: and tea a couple of times?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something to think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to go organic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to go synthetic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to go premix?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to go no-till?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to use compost?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are a lot of things to think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mostly, that's going to be the amount of
work you want to do, the dedication you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to put in, and also your budget is a
lot of what's going to decide that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you a bottle mixer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you a science geek or are you like
Jesse and want to get your fingernails
[SPEAKER_01]: dirty and mix organics?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is my opinion, not Jeff's,
but we'll talk about it more in the next
[SPEAKER_02]: show, but there's no reason not to grow
organic outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually much, much easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll completely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody is going to be on the same
page with us though, but I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to do it outdoors,
why not go organic?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to be mixing up veg bloom
and carrying it outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pot size always go bigger and smart pots
outdoors are way better than black plastic
[SPEAKER_02]: ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, those earth colored, the tan colored
smart pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those things are sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use those outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse said it right, go big.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your pot is too big, the only downfall
is that you can hold more water so you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have to water as frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a problem outdoors because
you're going to be amazed at how much
[SPEAKER_01]: these plants drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it gets 90 to 100 degrees out there
and the plants need water at six in the
[SPEAKER_01]: morning and at noon and at three.
[SPEAKER_02]: How does a five gallon pot use 15 gallons
of water a day?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you just answered your question
right there pretty much in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then at the end of the year, when you've
got these giant resin covered buds,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to go, holy shit,
that's where all my water went.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to notice it's going to be
way worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, some people choose to drag their pots
indoors into a structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's something you want to do,
you're going to have to set a rigorous
[SPEAKER_01]: schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't fuck that up once or you're
going to cause problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: You also want a good dolly system so that
you don't bust the plants up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen that happen a few times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually we'll throw it in, but tools is
something that will, tools that you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to make a note of tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll keep going though, down your list
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, feel free to add stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are the outdoor expert here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we call you in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like Rick from Pond Stars.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is I think our third episode we've
done on outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go back through all the Chronicles
or as Jeff is releasing the old episodes,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll run into some of the older outdoor
episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a lot of ways they're similar,
but they also show our experiences
[SPEAKER_02]: changing throughout the years too.
[SPEAKER_01]: As growers and podcasters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait to start putting out the
episodes when you start popping in the
[SPEAKER_01]: show in the old G.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because bro, you've come a long way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was so nervous.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were dead silent the first episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would nod.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a podcast and you're nodding bro,
but we'll get you going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you can't get you to shut up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're mic friendly also.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pots, big pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to drag them in,
like Jesse said, get a dolly system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been putting everything on wheels
at the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything I can put on wheels, it's on
wheels.
[SPEAKER_01]: The shop vac came on wheels.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking pulled them off and built our
own wheels for it because they're better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if it can roll, it makes my life way
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the most used tool in my grow
lately has been a shop vac.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A pH pin in the shop vac is what we use
the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get big pots, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will talk about soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hole size, hole size, however much room
you've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can dig like a three foot round,
two foot deep hole and fill it with super
[SPEAKER_01]: high quality soil that's amended with the
proper amendments that we're going to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about in another episode, do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spend that money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A three by three hole that is 18 inches
deep is 100 gallons.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a 100 gallon smart pot or hole is very
common and you'll be very successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen people use kiddie pools,
like the pools that your kid plays in,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the front lawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me, I'm going to burp.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do that, stab some holes in the
bottom of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to drain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to create a mud hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to, you want to have aeration in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a soldering iron and just fucking go
all Christopher walking on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the coolest image in my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, fucking stab it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't do a walk in impersonation,
but it's your dirt when he threatens to
[SPEAKER_02]: stab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just see it happening with a soldering
iron in a pool though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow your weed asshole.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think about if you want to do pots or
if you want to go directly in the ground,
[SPEAKER_01]: that may not be an option.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have this, the decision may be
made for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: My backyard, where I live is all rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't go into that ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have to till up all the rock and have
to dig three feet and replace all the
[SPEAKER_01]: dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're only go grow in the place for a
year or you don't know for sure you're
[SPEAKER_02]: growing there the next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pots are, you know, soil is expensive and
there's no reason you can't reuse it again
[SPEAKER_02]: the next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I recommend pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're, if you're more comfortable and
you know, like say you own the house or
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that, then I recommend
building up a hole in the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it takes a lot of work and initially
you're going to haul off half the soil in
[SPEAKER_02]: that hole and import a pea or cocoa based
potting soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're outdoors in commercial,
I also recommend pots and get your
[SPEAKER_02]: checkbook out because it's very fucking
expensive to do 99 hundred gallon plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or even one giant trellis.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're, you know, kind of a more NorCal
style grower and you're doing,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, 25 plants or something like
that, I'd probably go with plants in the
[SPEAKER_02]: ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of it also, it depends on the
quality of soil at your location.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we'll go over that some more next
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go in depth on dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna just write dirt real big.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been learning a lot of new stuff
about probiotics and working with native
[SPEAKER_02]: soils and soil compositions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping next episode I can put it
together in my brain well enough to,
[SPEAKER_02]: to convey it to the listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good at fishing parts out and putting
them together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll put it, we'll put it on paper and
make it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've, now you've decided if you're
running clones or seeds, you've decided if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going in pots or in the ground,
Jesse's going to teach you what kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: soil to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't want to mix up fancy soil,
you can go to the store and buy some crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: We recommend that you mix up some good
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you need to decide, are you going to
grow in a greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to go to Lowe's?
[SPEAKER_01]: And buy a little crappy greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to call forever flowering
and get the fucking convertible custom
[SPEAKER_01]: Corvette greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are you going to go light depth?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about a whole nother
episode about light depth and hoop houses,
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Light depth or hoop house is also another
option.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you just want to go butt naked and
go outdoors and just grow outdoors under
[SPEAKER_01]: the sun, under the stars with no cover?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something you need to think about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in that equation, the more money you
spend, the higher quality of bud you will
[SPEAKER_02]: have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants that are just outdoors get really
beat up by the rain, the wind.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sun even to a point, but that doesn't
really happen till later in the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you get frostier bud, the more you
cover your plants.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like the way you put it in the very
beginning of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more you spend, the better it will
come out in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you spend wisely, you can't just make
it rain and expect the plants to come out
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you spend some decent money on a
decent greenhouse that has ventilation and
[SPEAKER_01]: protects it from the wind, the hail,
maybe even some of the bugs, it will
[SPEAKER_01]: really help you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of cover goes a long way when
it comes to growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even when you know it's going to rain,
you don't even need to cover the plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: just a well-placed piece of plastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you realize where the rain is coming
from, in your patch, always figure out
[SPEAKER_02]: where the prevailing wind comes from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like here, say at my work, the wind always
comes out of the west.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our outdoor plants will be protected
from the dust that comes from the west
[SPEAKER_02]: with a simple piece of plastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guarantee it'll make a noticeable
difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: So think about stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's planning, planning, planning,
planning.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what this whole episode's about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plan ahead, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way when shit does come up,
you're not out there scrambling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cover the plants, something above them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I was going to say a long time ago,
when I first got, I've got a DinoLite
[SPEAKER_01]: scope that hooks up to my computer and you
can see trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the whole size of my computer
screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like one trichome is whatever this Mac
looks like a 13-inch screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the trichome head was a 13-inch circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were putting buds under it and we had
indoor and outdoor buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the indoor buds had these big,
beautiful bulbous trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the outdoors were similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we got to one batch and I was
like, what the fuck's up with these
[SPEAKER_01]: trichomes?
[SPEAKER_01]: They look beat to shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was because they got beat up by rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm certain of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were outdoors and the rain just
pummeled those trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took all the bulbous heads right off of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just stocks on a lot of the
trichomes on the very tops of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, protect your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll keep those trichomes on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what you're farming for.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a trichome farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your goal, turps and trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need the green part.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just the carrier.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just the earth suit for all of what
we need.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell happens pretty much everywhere,
especially in the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's pretty predictable about what
times of the year it's going to happen at.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to cover the plants
completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually throwing up plastic over
plants during a hell storm can actually
[SPEAKER_02]: damage it worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: A series of chicken wire and stuff like
chicken wire.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's it just like screen?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to think of a specific kind
of screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But all that kind of stuff, it can help
break up the hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, it'll bounce off of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot easier to put up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe like a ceiling or a roof of just
chicken wire.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it's coming down, it just breaks
and you still get plenty of sun
[SPEAKER_01]: penetration.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recommend like at least two layers and
overlap them on each other so that it
[SPEAKER_02]: makes the holes even smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, or real fine, real even extra fine
chicken wire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what that would be called,
but monkey wire.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a finer mesh like a quarter inch
screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't think of the term I normally call
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something with small, fine holes so that
when that hell comes it shatters it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a brilliant idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have never thought of it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it does rain on your buds,
the natural instinct is to want to go out
[SPEAKER_02]: there and shake them dry or blow them dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're actually when you're doing
that, you're actually pushing water into
[SPEAKER_02]: the bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you leave it to its own devices,
it'll drain it away from the outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that I've never
mentioned, but it was a theory that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: had.
[SPEAKER_01]: First off, trichomes work is like like
Rain-X.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when you put Rain-X on your
windshield, trichomes work just like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that the way the cannabis
plant shapes itself, it works as an
[SPEAKER_01]: umbrella and it pushes the water out to
where the outer roots are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I think the plant represents the
underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I'm shaped this way up top.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm shaped this way on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it umbrellas the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It spreads it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The leaves go outward and the water runs
outwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: It falls down and it lands at the base on
an outward circle where it wants it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it yeah, I totally agree with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it rains on a plant, it drops its
leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you might get scared,
you know, freak out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's its own natural defense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's covering the bud and it's helping
drain it away from the plant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant's got little hairs, little
cuticle hairs all over the leaves that
[SPEAKER_01]: they move the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't see it happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like little fingers just brushing
the water the right direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: They encourage it to flow the right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plant is protecting itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So greenhouse, we talked about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to talk about projected problems
and ways to kind of get ahead of them
[SPEAKER_01]: before we get to them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I just burped right into the mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to prevent it so bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a rude ass podcaster.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried so hard to avoid that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about some problems that may
come up.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one you'll probably see is,
well, some people see aphids pretty quick
[SPEAKER_02]: or thrips.
[SPEAKER_02]: They still tend to come out pretty late in
the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: And grasshoppers too, this also applies
for.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way to get rid of them the best you
can is preventative getaway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus, I'm all stoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: My fault, my fault.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jenny Beth's fault.
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting to lose my voice too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get all the vegetation away from them,
especially like sunflowers and sunflowers,
[SPEAKER_02]: tumbleweeds, all that kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grasshoppers love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you get all the food away from their
plant, from, you know, the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inviting things, remove that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year you told me chickens to defend
against grasshoppers.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once the plants are... Once they're big
enough to be... Once they're bigger than
[SPEAKER_02]: the chicken.
[SPEAKER_01]: Above pick and range, peck and range.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't even think I was going to talk
about bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad you said thrips and aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aphids, you guys are really easy to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked about them in another episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's not spray a bunch of shit outside,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's not put pesticides on the outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Jesse's outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my daughter's outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everybody's outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's not spray too much shit to disrupt
outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to buy some stuff to use to
combat the bugs outside, buy predatory
[SPEAKER_01]: insects and release them on your garden
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best thing you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to disrupt the ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or be patient and wait for nature to work
its course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you get aphids, whatever eats
aphids is coming next.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be like aphids and it's
going to come have a fucking orgy on your
[SPEAKER_01]: aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to eat them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is an email service that you can
sign up for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will have the link for the next show.
[SPEAKER_02]: You plug in your region and that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all the information you have to
give them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they send you free emails to let you
know, hey, it's almost aphid season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or hey, it's almost spider mite season.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a tool that all farmers use.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just learned about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to bring dope growers in on
this too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think it's really neat that the
Department of Agriculture in Colorado has
[SPEAKER_01]: stepped up and said, hey, you're growing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were a part of the Department of
Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an agricultural product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before they denied us, they didn't want
anything to do with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they're actually helping us out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're stepping in and saying,
these are things you can do, things you
[SPEAKER_01]: can use, ways you can solve them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to learn a lot more stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure somebody in the Department of Ag
shared that with one of our dope growing
[SPEAKER_01]: friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, actually I've been doing some webinars
and I learned about it from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love how hungry for info you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You stay busy and you stay learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else was I going to say?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about bugs, but I've got a
list here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got lost, I can jump in whenever
you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grasshoppers.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a product called Nolobate and it's
biological.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will not harm the earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here in Southern Colorado, you throw it
out in about a month.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a microbe that eats.
[SPEAKER_02]: The grasshopper will eat the bait because
when grasshoppers first emerge,
[SPEAKER_02]: there isn't a whole lot of food.
[SPEAKER_02]: The theory is they're going to go after
this bait.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like granulated, just grasshopper
bait.
[SPEAKER_02]: They eat it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually a biological fungus and it
stops them from being able to eat
[SPEAKER_02]: anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: They grow mold from the inside out and
they die.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beneficial fungus are amazing,
aren't they?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out at my work, they had problems with
grasshoppers big time last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: They spent a lot of money on a consultant
to tell them that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some free info for you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't waste money on that consultation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Nolobate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nolobate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not available anywhere, but the
public can buy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you type it in, you'll find it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just Google it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get yourself some Nolobate.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to throw down like 200 fucking
pounds of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sprinkle it out there all day like an old
guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that when I talked about
possible problems, cops.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing dope, be prepared for
police.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a nervous person, if you get
anxious around law enforcement,
[SPEAKER_01]: learn to calm the fuck down.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you act around cops is like a good 70%
of how they treat you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless if they come in and there's a
fight, they're treating everybody how they
[SPEAKER_01]: are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you answer the door that two
seconds from when you open the door,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you go, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you open the door with a smile and you
go, good evening officer, is there a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: You might be okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have committed the same crime as
the guy that opened the door going,
[SPEAKER_01]: what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're, good evening officer.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can I help you tonight?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm super cordial and I have a smile on my
face that could make your night go
[SPEAKER_01]: completely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could end up on your couch taking a
dab or you could end up in the pen bugging
[SPEAKER_01]: with handcuffs on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had a cop in my patch and I had a
pistol on my side.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all about the way I presented
myself to the police officer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're here now, so I'm sure it went
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: You actually complimented the gun.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool cops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you guys, if the cops are showing
up, make sure you're not doing something
[SPEAKER_01]: stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't have a reason for them to come
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Know your rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they knock on the door, if you're
doing something wrong in the house,
[SPEAKER_01]: step outside, lock the door behind you,
lock yourself out of the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're locked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody's going to fucking help you get
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now those cops can't get in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if they're like, let's go in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, I'm locked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't, they can't go search your house
if you wanted to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even better yet, walk around, lock
yourself out and walk around to the back
[SPEAKER_02]: door.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I mean, don't surprise them
when you walk around, but that even,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, cause then they can't even look
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't let them in.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you cannot come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a warrant?
[SPEAKER_01]: No warrant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: If they don't have a problem and don't
have probable cause, they're not coming
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let them in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't talk you into coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't want them to come in,
tell them no.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they come in without your consent and
no warrant, hopefully everything that
[SPEAKER_01]: happens gets dismissed because they fucked
up and did it wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to go get a warrant signed by a
judge.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need probable cause.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to come back and do it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The minute they leave, call two of your
best friends and get the fuck rid of
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they're coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just go get rid of everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get that shit gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean up.
[SPEAKER_01]: No evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to get rid of every stick.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to get rid of your scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to get rid of it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even take your head stash over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wherever you're taking your shit,
just get rid of it for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they're coming back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recently read the cornbread mafia.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a book about some dope growers in
Kentucky from back in the eighties and
[SPEAKER_02]: nineties.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, when Kentucky first started using
airplanes to site grows, they had an
[SPEAKER_02]: airplane fly over the grow and there were
guys working in this one or two acre grow
[SPEAKER_02]: that was full of pot plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time the airplane turned around,
went to the airport, landed, got the cops
[SPEAKER_02]: in the cars and started driving to where
they were at.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they got there, the entire fucking
field was harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to be that quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you need to do, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think of how long it takes us to harvest
at work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, these guys did that shit
fucking like seriously, like 30,
[SPEAKER_02]: 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were prepared, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had U-Haul trucks on site.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were going.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a great read by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I highly recommend it to any readers out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornbread cowboys?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cornbread mafia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornbread mafia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mixed cocaine cowboys and cornbread
mafia together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the DEA is doing with that stupid
name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys read that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like a good read.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse only recommends good books.
[SPEAKER_01]: So read that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Know what you're going to say if the
police come.
[SPEAKER_01]: Know your rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be an asshole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have an idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not a good public speaker,
seriously look in the mirror and get rid
[SPEAKER_01]: of your damn intimidation of police
officers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just assholes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not all.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're people with badges with a job to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them don't want to bust your
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just been told to by somebody
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to go do it as their job.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to be cordial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Know your rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't come in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't have any marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come back with a warrant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just practice the same shit in a car.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never heard this or I've never been
in this situation, but I've heard if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're in the point where, you know,
you're fucked, uh, offer to start chopping
[SPEAKER_02]: them down for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're in your grow and they're like,
you're going to jail for 50 plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: just get scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if I just cut them down right now,
sir?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can watch me cut them all down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll help you when you go to court.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or yeah, that's what the theory is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, another thing you need to worry about
you guys is thieves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, don't advertise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't brag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't tell everybody you're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't tell anybody you're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had, I had to grow with some friends
and one guy got mad at another guy and the
[SPEAKER_01]: next morning the whole crop was gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one guy wasn't involved,
but I know that he told that the two best
[SPEAKER_01]: friends talked and our whole crop,
four or five people's operation is gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause one guy told one guy that shouldn't
have known he took fucking everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: 75 outdoor plants that were taller than
me, all gone the day before we went to
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We drove up to harvest to a bunch of
sticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't, don't tell people, uh,
don't tell your girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't tell your cousin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't tell your best friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't tell your bandmates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't tell your masseuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't just shut up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody needs to know about your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we're all happy to take pictures of
it, but if just be careful, people are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to go steal shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are rippers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it far from the fences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't have it out where people can reach
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy had a big outdoor grow with a lot
of plants and they started taking the
[SPEAKER_01]: corners.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just took the ones in the Northwest
corner and then the other corner and they
[SPEAKER_01]: just got every corner where they can just
barely get in and get out, get in and get
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they started picking them inward.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time they got like six plants,
we all just stayed up all night,
[SPEAKER_01]: cut everything down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thieves don't set up booby traps.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not set up booby traps.
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody gets hurt by a booby trap you
set up for your cannabis plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: you are going to get hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an actual charge and it's called man
trapping and it is very easily can become
[SPEAKER_02]: a felony.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hear that guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're trying to grow medicine and you
just accidentally committed a felony by
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to fuck somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them steal your pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just let them take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to take some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't shoot them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't kill them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you let your dog out on them,
the dog's going to get put down if it
[SPEAKER_01]: bites them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just really think about how you're
going to defend that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best bet is to secure it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have it in a locked area and don't tell
anybody about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it, grow out in the county,
far, far out in the country, far,
[SPEAKER_01]: far away from everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't tell anyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many, many of these problems go away or
greatly, greatly reduce the further,
[SPEAKER_02]: the further you get away from metropolitan
areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can go far away, do it and don't
tell anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if somebody tries to steal it,
grow more next year you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put out like six plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put out plants in different patches is a
good way to protect from thieves and cops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put out six.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got one for the bugs, one for the
animals, one for the thieves.
[SPEAKER_01]: One for the cops, and then hopefully two
for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then do another patch a few miles
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be careful of cops and thieves,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep your mouth shut.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not in a legal state,
don't post pictures of yourself on the
[SPEAKER_01]: internet with your weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait until it's harvested, packed up,
sold, then post a picture of yourself with
[SPEAKER_01]: it because now it's already gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been showing me, what weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we talked a little bit about bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk briefly because I see you were
at an hour and I saw you look at your
[SPEAKER_01]: phone and it's 10,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: 30, so I know we got to wrap this up
pretty quick for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're right at an hour anyway,
so it's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about animals that we may run
into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deer seem to love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rabbits seem to love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cats fucking love cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cats, okay, we'll just start at the end
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cats will be one of your least concerns
and their only concern early in the
[SPEAKER_02]: season.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do like to use your awesome potting
soil as a litter box too that's also a
[SPEAKER_02]: concern.
[SPEAKER_02]: So early in the season, they can be kind
of a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had a cat kill several clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to replant three times one time at
this one place.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, I can't really get too pissed
at the cat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the plant just as much too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the litter box, you can mulch with
plastic and just cover your soil area and
[SPEAKER_02]: that will stop them from trying to use
your soil as a litter box.
[SPEAKER_02]: That also help with your watering and
building beneficial bacteria and fungi
[SPEAKER_02]: below it.
Sweet.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll trap some heat in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chicken wire cages will protect them when
they're small from cats and deers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Deer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another cool, or let's go back to deer
some more.
[SPEAKER_02]: A cool trick I've recently learned is you
could run a simple two wire hot wire
[SPEAKER_02]: around your patch and then you bait it by
wrapping aluminum foil around the wire and
[SPEAKER_02]: smear peanut butter on the wire.
[SPEAKER_02]: The deer will smell the peanut butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: They walk up and lick it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if anyone knows what hot wire does,
the deer won't come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I promise.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's totally legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to hurt the deer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just enough to piss it off and let it
know, don't come here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can get a hot wire system for a
couple hundred bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost guaranteed to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to slow down a thief also.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you hear someone in the backyard go,
ah, fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just hit the hot wire.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That works really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the middle one you said?
[SPEAKER_02]: Rabbits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rabbits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chicken wire cages.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're only going to be a concern when
the plants are really small.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And their poop would be actually
beneficial.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think mice are going to get to the
cannabis plants if you got mice in the
[SPEAKER_01]: field or whatever?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never personally had problems with
it.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it was an issue, I would recommend a 22
and a little scope, but that's just.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully the cat that we had problems
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or a snake would solve your problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another issue would be gophers eating the
roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, little fuckers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never seen prairie dogs do it,
but gophers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the way you fix that is if you're
planting in the ground, put chicken wire
[SPEAKER_02]: around the perimeter of your hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're planting in a smart pot,
put chicken wire around the.
[SPEAKER_01]: Underneath it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Set the plant on chicken wire essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: They won't chew through the wire.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty smart.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have, if that doesn't stop
them, just use a heavier gauge of wire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go up to like some concrete mesh or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if once again, the 22 will work
on a gopher also.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Simple traps will work on gophers too.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else might we need to worry about
throughout the season?
[SPEAKER_02]: Elk.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd be the same as deer depending on
your location.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people right now are going,
what the fuck elk?
[SPEAKER_02]: We live in Colorado, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are elk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard of bears getting in patches,
but they were going after the stuff in the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil, the blood mill and bone mill.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're growing in bear country,
keep that in mind because that's bear
[SPEAKER_02]: bait.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they don't give a fuck about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, there's nothing you
can do to really stop a bear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just fucking lock the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get in the truck and drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Snakes, I don't believe would be an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would only be a harm to the farmer
himself.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And only a small percentage of those are
actually going to be a harm to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit, I can't take any other pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like we've got some stuff for more
episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get tools next time because I do
need to go get some dinner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I've got a couple of things to
handle also.
[SPEAKER_01]: So man, thank you for coming and doing a
long podcast with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did over an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's super awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to tell people how they can
find you on social media so that they can
[SPEAKER_01]: stalk you and see your garden?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can check me out on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been super active lately,
but I'm sure when this big outdoor girl
[SPEAKER_02]: that I'm doing at work gets going,
I'll be posting pictures of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go click like on what he's already got
up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, you'll encourage him to post new
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since you got a bunch of people listening
to you, you got anything you want to say
[SPEAKER_01]: before we click stop on the recording?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up to my beautiful wife?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are in the state of Colorado and
you're buying anything from Willie Lee's
[SPEAKER_02]: reserve under the strain, Gorilla Glue,
Old Time Bubble Gum, or Granddaddy Perp,
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good work, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congrats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't you love it that people can come
just buy products that you grew and you
[SPEAKER_01]: can tell how I did that before you had to
kind of hide.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just sent them some bubble gum last
week that they're going to turn the large
[SPEAKER_02]: shipment of cannabis into pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to use trim or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was one of the best batches of
bubble gum I've grown so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's Willie stuff is expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you what, but that's the
cheapest way to get into it and get them
[SPEAKER_02]: while they're fresh still.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get them while they're fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, you don't want your joints
drying up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody wants a crusty dried up pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank everybody for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: No advertisement or anything at the end of
this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
friend Bone Ellis for giving me a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: shout out on her podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a huge shout out to Jesse
for joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for everybody for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And until next time, take a fad dab and
give your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know
[SPEAKER_04]: this little girl, her name is Maxine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Her beauty is like a bunch of roses.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I ever tell you about Maxine,
you would say, I don't know what I know,
[SPEAKER_04]: but murder she wrote.
[SPEAKER_04]: Murder she wrote.
[SPEAKER_04]: Murder she wrote.
