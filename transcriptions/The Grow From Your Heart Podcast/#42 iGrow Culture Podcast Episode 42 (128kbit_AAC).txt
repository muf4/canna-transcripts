[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, what's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time for episode number 42 of the
iGrowCulture podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: They call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, joining me at the table tonight,
we have a brand new guest who's never been
[SPEAKER_04]: on the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, Tony?
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_04]: I am great, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to turn down the music a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tony is the dude that built my website.
[SPEAKER_04]: He built the iReGenetics website.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tony is responsible for getting the feed
up that hosts the iGrowCulture podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, dude, big huge shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't get the credit you deserve.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Props for that, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gosh, excuse me while I cough out a lung.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as usual, well, not usual,
as often, I guess, our good buddy Jesse is
[SPEAKER_04]: back.
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, podcast land?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you guys have a good Thanksgiving?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I imagine you did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tony's got an Italian family, so I could
imagine how much you guys ate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No headphones for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes this thing cuts out,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's this headphone jack here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did it come back?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once in a while, it'll just fart out on
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just give me that same where the fuck are
my headphones signal and we'll correct it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have it right now either.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we'll keep going.
[SPEAKER_04]: You back?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your Thanksgiving, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: I almost skipped you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the privilege of going to four
Thanksgiving dinners.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I had two Thanksgiving dinners,
incidentally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to my aunt Lisa.
[SPEAKER_04]: She made a huge Thanksgiving dinner for
the whole family.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really super cool of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was tasty.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a vegetarian, so she was really nice
and made some things differently than she
[SPEAKER_04]: would have.
[SPEAKER_04]: She didn't put beef broth and bacon in
some shit, so I had a lot of options to
[SPEAKER_04]: eat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, huge shout out to Angela.
[SPEAKER_04]: Angela doesn't have any family here in
Colorado, so I totally invited her to come
[SPEAKER_04]: eat dinner with my family and I,
and she had a great time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: She was totally cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: My family loved her, so thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really appreciate that, Angela.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope all the listeners had a good
Thanksgiving, or if you're not into that,
[SPEAKER_04]: then I hope you had a great Thursday and a
good weekend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people hate Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm impartial, and I go eat with the
family to be social like we should.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's one of the better holidays.
[SPEAKER_02]: At its core, it's one of the better
holidays.
[SPEAKER_04]: What about 420, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, that's an awesome holiday.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like Christmas for the potheads.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, do I have any other stuff we got to
do?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get to some ads real quick so we can
get right down to business.
[SPEAKER_04]: On this episode, I do plan on doing a
little lesson on nutrients and stuff,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I also have a good question for my
buddy Tony.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tony is an organic chemistry student.
[SPEAKER_04]: How far are you from your degree,
bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: About five.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 credit hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't go to college, so what does that
mean for humans?
[SPEAKER_01]: A semester.
[SPEAKER_04]: A semester.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tony's a new father, so he's distracted
from school.
[SPEAKER_04]: Congrats on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: He hasn't been around as much,
so I'm sure he's not at school as much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Turn down that music.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to yell over it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It feels way better.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we'll have Tony talk about a couple of
things here in a minute.

[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, I've got the coughs from some
dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: This podcast, you going to cough too?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll turn your mic off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those dabs were killer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they were kind of bigger than what
we should have taken right before a show.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was heavy duty.
[SPEAKER_04]: We wanted to get it done and get to the
show.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you take two dabs that are really big,
you just move on.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to sit there and dab out
all day.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big love to Treethugger.com.

[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to save this one for a little
bit here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk about that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big love to all the sponsors, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: We really appreciate you guys helping us
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, a big shout out to Coot Dog and
Catherine of the Mystic Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_04]: They let me play all of their music on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: How cool is that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't go much cooler than that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to give a big shout out to Spence
and Maddie.
[SPEAKER_04]: They came over the other night and helped
me do a chore.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish you guys great luck with the secret
cup that you're headed to.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you guys bring home a trophy and a
whole bunch of prizes and a new rig.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to dab out of your new rig on the
podcast next week.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be super awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the respect that you totally deserve
and are worthy of.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you hear that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't say that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't say that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my homie, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_04]: I butter him up a lot, but Jesse just said
that you guys deserve respect.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, a big shout out to Laz.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you listen to the show,
but I met a dude named Laz recently.
[SPEAKER_04]: We finally met in person.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been online buddies.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to hang out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool ass dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, last shout out for a minute,
Mr. Omnio.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're finally caught up on episodes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like we're hanging out in his
kitchen.
[SPEAKER_04]: He left a tweet that says, I'm listening
while I'm making beef bouillon.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like they're hanging out in my
kitchen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, we record this show about 10 feet
from my kitchen.
[SPEAKER_04]: That could have been a reality almost.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were almost there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come cook for us.
No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come cook for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody can come cook for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a strict vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse will eat almost anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tony, you cool?
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything, man?
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come cook for us, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can be the agriculture chef.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a couple topics written down.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them, this just came up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was kind of rude to somebody the other
day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I realized that they were selling their
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Their crop got powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of salvaging it, they decided to
cut the crop down and make live resin out
[SPEAKER_04]: of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would not have known about it unless
somebody else told me that they were doing
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I called him out on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, you are the difference between
being a caregiver and a cashcropper.
[SPEAKER_04]: You are the person that's going to make
somebody sick because we shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_04]: giving tainted medicine to people who
already have a compromised immune system.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other people in the room treated me like I
was kind of going overboard.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I felt it was kind of my
responsibility to call this dude out and
[SPEAKER_04]: let him know that he's really doing it
wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's making us all look bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's not helping the movement at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's not what I'm working towards.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanted to have a little bit of backup
when I approach this dude saying this is
[SPEAKER_04]: why.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why I brought Tony on the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I was saying earlier, Tony is an
organic chemistry student, and he knows a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess the simple question I want to
ask, once again, excuse my dab throat.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we take these powdery mildewed buds and
we blast them with butane, are we going to
[SPEAKER_04]: get powdery mildew or what is happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell me a little about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you're not going to get the powdery
mildew itself, but you'll get the
[SPEAKER_01]: mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or any sort of toxins that they create,
which powdery mildew is fairly toxic to
[SPEAKER_01]: humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, believe it or not, you could actually
probably be better off smoking the buds
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself, not distributing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it would be less toxic than blasting
it and concentrating it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why they call them concentrates,
because we're concentrating everything
[SPEAKER_01]: that's in the plant matter into an oil
that is far, far, far more concentrated
[SPEAKER_01]: than the plant matter itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hadn't even thought about that route.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're making powdery mildew dabs,
just like you are hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're taking the mycotoxins and
concentrating it.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, sorry, I got to fix that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got that mic up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you say fairly toxic, could you put
some kind of comparison on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's definitely not like black mold
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm sure you guys remember the swag
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the cheap brick weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That stuff had powdery mildew in it very
often.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even smoking small quantities of that,
you'd end up with chest congestion,
[SPEAKER_01]: bronchitis usually, sore throat for a week
and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can imagine what happens if you
concentrate it 10 to 15 times the dosage.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you take a big fat dab like I
like to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you just probably got a good percentage
of mycotoxins in your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and the trippy thing about that is
it's not going to show up immediately,
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably going to show up in a month
or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really weird effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably going to go a little nuts
from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of psychosis in my mind?
[SPEAKER_01]: Behavior change, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Paranoia.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's if we smoke a lot, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not like from one or two dabs to
some PM dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's consistent small doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're smoking it just once a day
for a week or two, it's going to do some
[SPEAKER_01]: weird stuff to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You definitely don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes you think, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wonder where your dabs are coming from.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said, this is something that caught
my mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, it's almost, it would be better
if you smoke the buds than it would be to
[SPEAKER_04]: smoke the hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also like that you said,
smoke the damn buds yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't give them out to anybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you should do.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you grew powdery mildew buds and you
have to do something, smoke it yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: That way, reap what you sow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That way you're not getting somebody else
sick.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to do it, do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't give it to someone else to smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_04]: You said a little bit of psychosis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think a little bit of headache,
nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, stuff that
[SPEAKER_04]: would be described as hidden or mistaken
as other things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually flu-like or cold symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as it gets later, you'll
definitely get like typical mold
[SPEAKER_01]: poisoning, like seizures and very,
very, very, very bad things will happen to
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kidney and liver toxicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: From mycotoxins, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those wreak havoc on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And powdery mildew is, it's of that type
of organism that's going to produce those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, they don't worry about it for
food crops very often because it's only
[SPEAKER_01]: leafy parts that get affected by it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most fruits like tomatoes and stuff won't
show the little patches on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like cucumbers or squash that always
get infected, the fruit itself is probably
[SPEAKER_02]: safe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, to consume, not to blast into hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably running into the same
trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cucumber resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get some turps, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even then that's not very strong
quantities because you have to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: large amount of leafy matter infected with
the white patches.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the fruiting body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's a toxin that's systemic that
goes throughout the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, you'll end up with it in your
cucumbers or squash or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: but not much.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we're smoking leafy, leafy
flowers, which accumulate that stuff with
[SPEAKER_01]: freakishly high concentrations itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not the same as a food issue
because it's technically considered
[SPEAKER_01]: non-toxic for food crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though they don't let it ever happen,
but you definitely don't want to be
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had it on, like you said,
the leafy parts of plants, but we've never
[SPEAKER_02]: actually, like I've never actually seen it
on the fruit.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're into the side of the mic like
you're some kind of gangster rapper.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Punk rocker.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've always, you know, since powdery
mildew kind of came around the last few
[SPEAKER_02]: five, six years, it seems like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've wondered about those late season
crops that always get infected with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've tended to throw a lot of that
stuff in the compost pile.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably what you should do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that powdery mildew going to affect his
compost?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to actually put that in
compost either, they say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a good one to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Microtoxin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured it got hot enough that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't kill the spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't actually have to worry about
inhaling the spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's literally the toxins that you're
burning are just going to wreak havoc on
[SPEAKER_01]: the mucous membranes at first,
and then it's going to make you feel a
[SPEAKER_01]: little weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen some big commercial rooms that I
felt like the spores actually burned my
[SPEAKER_02]: nose.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I know who you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I know who you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Possibly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this dude told me that using a one
micron screen would prevent any of the
[SPEAKER_04]: microtoxins or spores getting into the
hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's completely bullshit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we're basically juicing the
microtoxins right through that screen,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in solution, so you can't filter
them out as if they were solid particles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like the THC is, correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's totally the same thing as salt and
water, unless you actually have a filter
[SPEAKER_01]: that's not even a filter anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call it a semi-permeable membrane.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what osmosis uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not even a filter anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't filter a dissolved solid out of
liquid.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that Tony knows a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's warm in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: It got hot in here today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, those tabs got to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone's a little slow, I can tell on
the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically, powdery mildew is fucking
terrible, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got powdery mildew on your buds,
don't give that to somebody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Smoke that yourself if you're going to do
anything with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't blast it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please don't blast it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a medical marijuana provider and
you are giving powdery mildew buds to sick
[SPEAKER_04]: people, you're the devil.
[SPEAKER_04]: You are anti the movement.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're doing everything wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're making sick people sicker.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're causing more problems and you're
helping.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're the difference between a
cashcropper and a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be a cashcropper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm done with that rant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll stop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Ryan, if you listen to the podcast,
I kind of went off on you kind of hard
[SPEAKER_04]: about this the other day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_04]: I try to be a leader of the movement and a
lot of people will accept that and I want
[SPEAKER_04]: to speak out about it and make sure that
you know how passionately wrong I feel
[SPEAKER_04]: that it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I might have been rude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're still friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll still dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I promised that we would talk about
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys all feel good about the powdery
mildew topic?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for your expertise, Tony.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tony will be good at this nutrient part
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tony's I'm not going to call him a pro
level grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a couple few crops under his
belt.
[SPEAKER_04]: He he's got that chemistry background,
so it really helps him out, but it also
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of kills him.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, guys, we had to take a quick
break, but we are back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse had to dip out.
[SPEAKER_04]: He well, I wish I had a better story for
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: He took a dab and turned green,
so we had to cut out and get Jesse some
[SPEAKER_04]: water and get him to the couch right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse is chilling on the couch.
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll be all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: He may come back to the show, but I doubt
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said go on without him.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Insert your make fun of Jesse comments
right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is a professional, but sometimes a dab
will get you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's chilling.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do him some love by this way.
[SPEAKER_04]: This podcast is brought to you by our good
friends at Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies has two
locations to serve Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: Visit the Denver store on 6271 Beech
Street or check out the beautiful Pueblo
[SPEAKER_04]: location on 618 East 4th Street in Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check out Hygro for competitive prices and
a great selection of indoor grow supplies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hygro is running a special for the podcast
listeners.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you check out at Hygro, tell them you
listen to the I Grow Culture podcast and
[SPEAKER_04]: they will give you commercial pricing on
your entire purchase.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tony, you can do that too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell them I listen to the I Grow Culture
podcast and they'll give you commercial
[SPEAKER_04]: pricing, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a $25 bag of dirt for 17 bucks the
other day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So imagine if I was buying something big.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also a huge shout out to Hygro Indoor
Growing Supplies for hooking me up with a
[SPEAKER_04]: brand new Nano Lux light to test.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to Nano Lux lighting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't run it till January because my
rooms are full, but I really look forward
[SPEAKER_04]: to running that light.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the dual ended light bulbs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure it's going to put out some
lumens.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to make my room bright.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to make my plants happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse was giving them praise earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said he set up one light with a room
that had an uneven canopy because a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: times your middle plants will grow better
because that's where all the lighting is.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said they evened out within a week or
two.
[SPEAKER_04]: So must be doing something right.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said we're going to talk about doing
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was also mentioning that Tony is a
chemistry and organic chemistry major.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a physics nerd.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a computer nerd, but this dude knows
a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that his knowledge of science
really helps him when he grows,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I also think it almost kills him when
he grows.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plants are predictable, but plants aren't
science.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have limits.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I see Tony, he's like, I fed them
potassium.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why aren't they potassiuming it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, you got to go to bed and you
got to wait like three days.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you got to come back and check and
then maybe you'll see what you did.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, I want it now.
[SPEAKER_04]: He thinks he should mix it up and see
explosions for the way plants work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it works.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it does, but it's funny watching
you be baffled.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know how much you know about science and
organics and to see you look at me like,
[SPEAKER_04]: dude, how come?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just the smallest thing that you
overlooked.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great seeing you learn like that,
but sometimes it does slow you down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it totally shoots you in the
foot because you don't believe that the
[SPEAKER_04]: plants will do what I think they should do
on their own.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want everything to be the incredible
whole.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look on steroids, raw.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to talk a little bit about
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was hoping Jesse would be here because
he really has a lot of cool shit to
[SPEAKER_04]: contribute, but I will cover.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will try to, I'll go like, I'll put my
voice really deep.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll turn up the lows on the microphone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe we get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it didn't help, but I'll turn up my
voice real deep and I'll do Jesse's parts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, most of what we're going to cover
today will be based on bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a lot easier for a new home
grower to learn with a good line of
[SPEAKER_04]: bottled newts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, next week I'm going to have a guy
named Sean over, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe two weeks until I have Sean over.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to see what happens with the secret
cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I should, Sean will be here next week.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe Spence will be here the week after
with the secret cup victory.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm hoping for.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Sean's going to teach us about
organics and sustainable horticulture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sean doesn't use to the best of my
knowledge, Sean doesn't use any hydro
[SPEAKER_04]: store products.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, but for today's lesson, we're going to
focus on basics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, bottled nutrients are usually reliable
and consistent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our good friend, Adam, who couldn't be
here tonight, he specifically asked me
[SPEAKER_04]: what he needs to be feeding his plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he also asked, what the numbers on the
front of the bottles mean.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think the numbers on the front of the
bottle is a good question and it's a super
[SPEAKER_04]: good spot to start.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll talk about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are three numbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go to the hydro shop and you pick
up almost any fertilizer bottle,
[SPEAKER_04]: there are three numbers on the front.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, the first number represents nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_04]: The second number represents phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the third number represents potassium.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, that's NPK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, those are known as macro nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a bottle of basic grow nutrients,
like if you grab Botanicure, Botanicure
[SPEAKER_04]: Pure Blend Pro, or maybe some advanced
nutrients, Jungle Juice Grow, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: the numbers on there are going to be like
3, 2, 5, or 2, 1, 6, or something like
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Each brand is going to be different.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if it says 2, 3, uh, 3, 2, 5,
that's what we're going to work with now
[SPEAKER_04]: is 3, 2, 5.
[SPEAKER_04]: It means there's 3% nitrogen, 2%
phosphorus, and 5% potassium in that
[SPEAKER_04]: nutrient, in that bottle.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the numbers on those bottles tell us
the NPK values of what the NPK values are
[SPEAKER_04]: of the fertilizers we're buying.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's up to us to figure out,
uh, which bottles to use and when to use
[SPEAKER_04]: them and how much to use.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, most of the nutrient companies make a
really cool nutrient calculator that you
[SPEAKER_04]: can get at the hydro shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of times it's in a little insert
thing, like a coupon right next to the
[SPEAKER_04]: brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get those.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are always super helpful.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of times Tony will be like,
how much of this nutrient do I use?
[SPEAKER_04]: And since I'm kind of a nerd, I've
happened to have a bunch of those little
[SPEAKER_04]: inserts laying around and I'll just pull
it out and be like, it says this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I definitely recommend reducing the
recommended dosage to about half of what
[SPEAKER_04]: they say you use.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, sometimes 2, 3, 3.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can tell, we'll talk more about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wrote that part down.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, most of the companies make a chart
or also online.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go online to botanicare.com or
advancednutrients.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know they have super great, uh,
feeding schedule calculators.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, if you use a pre-developed recipe from
there, they'll tell you exactly what to
[SPEAKER_04]: use every week.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I suggest you reduce the dosage,
like I was saying, to about half.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those companies, they want to sell you
more.
[SPEAKER_04]: They really want you to buy more shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they tell you to use a little bit
extra, like five or 10 milliliters,
[SPEAKER_04]: every week adds up to them and to you,
but you don't notice it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your plants won't notice it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they kind of overfeed your plants on
purpose.
[SPEAKER_04]: So reduce what they say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, if you see signs of a deficiency,
you can increase your fertilizer on the
[SPEAKER_04]: next feed, but you can't, uh, if you over
correct it, if you overfeed, you can't
[SPEAKER_04]: correct that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, you've got burnt leaves and angry
roots and your plants look all fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: fried out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I think I've seen a couple of your
plants do that one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Tony's not afraid to mess with some
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tony is all about getting in there and
torturing the shit out of his crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually pH burns.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to talk a lot about pH burns.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we have time, I'm going to try to go
about 45 to an hour here, but if we have
[SPEAKER_04]: time for pH, we'll get into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, something I recommend, and this is,
uh, this is part of what I think Tony
[SPEAKER_04]: shoots himself in the foot with.
[SPEAKER_04]: I recommend that if you're going to use a
brand of bottled nutrients, you stick with
[SPEAKER_04]: the brand until you become experienced and
you can identify deficiencies and
[SPEAKER_04]: problems, which means a few things.
[SPEAKER_04]: First, if you use Botanicare Pure Blend
Pro as a base, I totally recommend using a
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever Botanicare Pure Blend Pro
additives you can afford to add,
[SPEAKER_04]: but don't mix stuff from other brands.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that sounds ridiculous,
like brand loyalty or a sales pitch,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I think it's rational with any brand
and I'll explain why.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mix brands because of,
and Tony will like this, chelation buffers
[SPEAKER_04]: and bonding agents versus organics.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of products have chemicals that make
the products last longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some, uh, have chemicals that prevent
certain compounds from bonding inside the
[SPEAKER_04]: bottle and ruining the solution.
[SPEAKER_04]: And many of those chemicals will ruin all
of the beneficial compounds in an organic
[SPEAKER_04]: solution.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Tony may correct me on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like if I poured some synthetic
nutrient, like if I got almost anything
[SPEAKER_04]: from advanced nutrients, if I poured Big
Bud into a batch of organic compost tea,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the Big Bud would kill most of the
bioactivity in my compost tea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think Big Bud, especially like,
uh, overdrive definitely would wreak
[SPEAKER_01]: havoc.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about my Mycos?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it just going to destroy my Myco life?
[SPEAKER_01]: Destroy your Mycos and, um, actually it's
probably going to bring things out of
[SPEAKER_01]: solution, uh, like calcium compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those, once they're unavailable to the
plant, they actually, uh, create other
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about balance apparently.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just over, uh, you've definitely
enforced what I was trying to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: I sound like I know what I'm talking about
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So unless you, uh, unless you're sure the
product gets along with other products,
[SPEAKER_04]: you shouldn't be adding two things,
uh, from different brands because you
[SPEAKER_04]: could cause problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could have everything going for the
first six weeks and then you go and add in
[SPEAKER_04]: some Bud booster that doesn't match up
with your schedule.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it could totally just ruin all the
work you've done for the past veg time
[SPEAKER_04]: plus six weeks of flour.
[SPEAKER_04]: So another reason I stick with one brand
is because as you learn, you need
[SPEAKER_04]: something to be consistent.
[SPEAKER_04]: As many things as you can need to be
consistent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it's hard to adapt to changes and
identify problems with too many variables.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like if we minimize the variables,
we can dial in our crops to perfection.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, if you're not truly happy with your
nutrients, you can for sure switch them,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I recommend trying the same brand
while you learn.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I keep talking about it,
but I personally, I like botanic hair.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've used advanced nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: I felt like with advanced, I got huge buds
and everything finished really quickly,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I also feel like, uh, everything
looked and smelled and tasted the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think there was much variation.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I ran OG Kush, sour diesel,
strawberry haze, they all kind of had the
[SPEAKER_04]: same advanced nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: They all smelled like Nirvana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, advanced, uh, it's actually kind
of like junk food.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the wrong kind of nitrogen that you
get.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd want for healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look nice, but they're not actually
as healthy as they should be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't ever think of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like all I could tell is that they were
taken off and for what I paid,
[SPEAKER_04]: I could tell I was getting my money's
worth.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was getting that extra that they
advertise, but I didn't like the flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you're growing crops for
yourself, I want the flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want the flavor I want.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I grew with Psycho.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did a couple rounds with Psycho.
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually gave me a free box set and I
ran it side by side next to botanic hair.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have a five by five hut next to a
five by five hut.
[SPEAKER_04]: But everything is the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in the same room.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did Psycho on one side, botanic hair
on the other.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Psycho side, everything turned really,
really purple and it was sexy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really photogenic bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again, I didn't like the flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't burn as well and it had a funky
flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used soul synthetics from Aurora,
excuse me, from Aurora innovations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it has a lot of molasses type stuff,
a lot of humic stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that made for tasty, tasty buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, it didn't give me enough harvest
and it didn't get real resiny.
[SPEAKER_04]: It tasted super good.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I didn't get the harvest I wanted.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Humboldt nutrients, that stuff worked
well, but, uh, there's a lot of PGRs and
[SPEAKER_04]: things I'm trying to get away from in
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, just like advanced nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to use a lot of PGRs and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Humboldt did well, but again, I prefer
botanic hair for the flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I liked the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about tea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's turning, now it's getting to be
all about the teas.
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy that's coming on next week is all
about making super awesome teas.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for my personal, I'll always probably
go back to the botanic hair Pure Blend Pro
[SPEAKER_04]: with all the additives recommended.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also use C Plex, uh, and, uh,
from the OrganiCare lineup.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll add some kind of molasses and
yucca extract and maybe some dehydrated
[SPEAKER_04]: coconut water to my feeding toward the
middle of bloom.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's our secret.
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't ever say that on a podcast where
people could hear you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually good for beginner growers
pile on the yucca.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your error tolerance for temperatures and
a bunch of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very good for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it's kind of like aloe vera on a
sunburn except inside.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that sounds weird, but it
definitely works to, uh, moisten things up
[SPEAKER_04]: and keep things safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: A good source of yucca extract.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't want to just go find yucca
extract and figure out how to use that,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, Humboldt honey is actually packed with
yucca extract and it's a great product.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need something with molasses and
sugars in it anyway, late in bloom.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, if anybody from Botanic hair is
listening, you can send me an email and
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll get you my shipping address and
sponsorship info.
[SPEAKER_04]: I read genetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check out my feed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, yeah, botanic hair.
[SPEAKER_04]: I buy a lot of your stuff guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, another reason I would stick to one
brand is because doubling up on nutrient
[SPEAKER_04]: brands, uh, you could actually double up
on something you don't want.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could have overlap.
[SPEAKER_04]: There could be too much, uh, magnesium in
this one or too much, uh, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_04]: molybdenum in this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you don't realize it because they
don't list all that small stuff on every
[SPEAKER_04]: bottle.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you use something from botanic care,
something from advanced nutrients,
[SPEAKER_04]: you may possibly be overdosing your plant
with something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so botanic care is not going to,
uh, botanic care is not going to make,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, a nutrient A with nutrient B that
would overlap.
[SPEAKER_04]: They would, and they kind of wouldn't,
they wouldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They know that that's in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: My throat's all clogged up from taking
those dabs that killed Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I should say that, uh, most of the
nutrient companies make their own myco
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those you can, uh, go a little outside
the, oh yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well as, uh, there's a few other things
like, uh, enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enzymes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, for enzymes, I always recommended the
hygrozyme.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for mycos lately, uh, all of the OGT
products are freaking awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also like great white shark myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put those in almost every plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to go the advanced nutrients
route and you want to spend a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: money, that piranha and tarantula in the
liquid bottles, it's $183 and 50 cents per
[SPEAKER_04]: bottle.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like 10 or 20 mils will give you
explosive roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put that shit in your cloner.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got an easy cloner, your roots
will push the lid off the cloner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your plants will get up and walk away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So once you guys get comfortable and have
a good understanding of your feeding
[SPEAKER_04]: routine, you can add whatever you feel
like you need.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just read the bottles, uh, adjust your
PPMs accordingly and pay attention to what
[SPEAKER_04]: you're feeding the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you're just read the labels,
like read them, go to the website,
[SPEAKER_04]: find out what's in those products.
[SPEAKER_04]: They should be readily available.
[SPEAKER_04]: If a company doesn't want to tell you
what's in their stuff, I don't want to use
[SPEAKER_04]: it is kind of how I feel anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wrote down a side note talking about
PPMs.
[SPEAKER_04]: A friend of mine was having problems with
his crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, his leaves were curling up looking
like, uh, goofy fingers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was a light leak during the
dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: He thought it was the genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, everybody was real confused.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just burped right into the microphone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody was real confused.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, but, uh, the room was correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had good genetics and after a few days
we realized a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: His magnetic ballasts were causing
interference with the PPM and pH meter and
[SPEAKER_04]: everything was way off.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's thinking he's balancing out the pH
perfectly, you know, six, five,
[SPEAKER_04]: seven, and he's actually making it 11 or
lower.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's probably going down.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably like four.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause that low is probably what made
everything curl is getting it real low.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, so, uh, what I, what I was going to
say is, uh, try to get away from your
[SPEAKER_04]: magnetic ballasts so that when you take
readings, your magnetic ballasts aren't
[SPEAKER_04]: making everything jump up and down and
also take good care of your PPM and pH
[SPEAKER_04]: meters.
[SPEAKER_04]: People overlook those and they're super
important.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse recommended making the cords as
short as possible, uh, in your grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that would definitely help with stuff
like having your PPM meter fluctuates so
[SPEAKER_04]: heavily.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, but it'll take a couple of weeks,
but his plants will be back on track.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just a couple of weeks behind.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll look good.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're talking about nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a side note.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to make sure to get out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our main goal here with nutrients is to
have the correct amount of nutrients at
[SPEAKER_04]: the right time, uh, to keep the plants at
peak performance without ever overfeeding
[SPEAKER_04]: them and causing nutrient burn or
lockouts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and also I wrote down, don't forget to
pay attention to your pH.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also I said, when you see problems
that look like deficiencies, they are
[SPEAKER_04]: often from a pH issue that was overlooked.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to push your plants to
perform, you need to have the proper pH.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think 6.5 to 7 is ideal for most
cannabis strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to adjust to your
room, your environment and your strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the cocoa fiber people, they have a
different range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the regular like deep water
culture, uh, hydro people, I think they
[SPEAKER_01]: want it down in the five fives.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that sounds about right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of what I talk about is soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, guys, I'm a soil, soil is kind of
guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most everything I do is in soil is mixed
indoors under a thousand watt lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you'll have to adjust like a thousand
times.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything is about adapting.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good call right now for reminding those
people or me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, so during, during the veg phase,
your plants are going to want,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, high levels of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_04]: As the plants progress into the flowering
stage, they're going to require much less
[SPEAKER_04]: nitrogen and they're going to want more
phosphorus and potassium.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to kind of shift into
explaining the nutrients and their
[SPEAKER_04]: functions, which is cool that Tony's here
for this one, cause he knows a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, you hear us talk about NPK.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll focus on nitrogen, phosphorus and
potassium.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go with nitrogen first.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll almost always hear nitrogen first.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, most of what you breathe is nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an odorless colorless gas that
constitutes over 75% of the earth's
[SPEAKER_04]: atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, despite the overwhelming presence of
atmospheric nitrogen, there are only a few
[SPEAKER_04]: kinds of plants in the legume family that
can make use of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Marijuana is not a legume.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it should say cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_04]: I cut and pasted this from the internet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give them credit in a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't want to break away from my
focus here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where is the website that I stole this
from?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't want to stumble around.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do too many things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm messing with the computer and getting
distracted.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, so marijuana is not a legume,
so nitrogen must be supplemented.
[SPEAKER_04]: Synthetically produced nitrogen fertilizer
is made in the form of anhydrous ammonia
[SPEAKER_04]: from natural gas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's what I said.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anhydrous ammonia from natural gas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, anhydrous ammonia is then usually
converted into ammonium nitrate for
[SPEAKER_04]: storage and ease of application.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once granulated, the ammonium nitrate is
ready for use as cost effective and easy
[SPEAKER_04]: to use plant food.
[SPEAKER_04]: Natural sources of nitrogen are numerous
and include blood meal, manure,
[SPEAKER_04]: bird and bat guano, among many others.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, guys, Sean will be here next
week.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to jump in for a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, he'll be here next week to discuss
this all organic method.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now he calls it organic as fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you hear about your nutrients being
fed, being made with anhydrous ammonia,
[SPEAKER_04]: it kind of makes you start getting more
interested in that sustainable
[SPEAKER_04]: horticulture stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds kind of weird and extreme,
like some crazy chemistry, but it actually
[SPEAKER_01]: happens in the soil itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little cycle that nitrates,
um, ammonium nitrate, and actually pure
[SPEAKER_01]: NH3 ammonia, um, are converted back and
forth by, uh, your mycos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes, uh, you'll buy a pack of mycos.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll say, uh, nitrogen fixing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they convert nitrates usually into the
ammoniums.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it happens in the soil anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but that's actually what makes
advanced nutrients junk food.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all nitrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to have some ammonium ions in
there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they actually do exist in the,
uh, composted organic stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they're just produced usually by
bacteria, aerobic decay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Tony's got access to all of the
ingredient lists and studies from the
[SPEAKER_04]: colleges, cause he's a college kid and,
uh, he's read some great shit and told me
[SPEAKER_04]: some great things about nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's that stuff right there that's
golden.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, where was I?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about Sean's coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, once I read about this stuff,
I got kind of like, I want to go more
[SPEAKER_04]: toward a sustainable way of growing my
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it'd be better.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my next step.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can crow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can breed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can select phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can identify problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like everything, my game is strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I just got to adjust and get more,
uh, more eco-friendly, quit using so much
[SPEAKER_04]: electricity and photohydro shop stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, much love to my hydro shop sponsor.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just got to get away from some of that
stuff, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, so because, uh, when I was talking
about nitrogen, because of its crucial
[SPEAKER_04]: role in photosynthesis, fertilizers high
in nitrogen are used during the vegetative
[SPEAKER_04]: phase of growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, nitrogen is key to both chlorophyll
and protein production and used throughout
[SPEAKER_04]: photosynthesis for the conversion of
carbon into sugars and other organic
[SPEAKER_04]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So grow fertilizers are high in nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're used for rapid growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're used to build chlorophyll and
promote a healthy green color.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they improve the volume and health of
plant foliage.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, you guys, if you see your plants
looking pale and yellow, that's your first
[SPEAKER_04]: sign of probably a nitrogen deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, we're 35 minutes in.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get through these nutrients at
least.
[SPEAKER_04]: This will be cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should say that the plant, most plants
in general will intake 80% of all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen they use in a lifetime during the
vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why all your vegetative cannabis
nutrients have a higher, um, nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: value than the flowering ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you cut that out right at the start
of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stores it up, uh, for metabolic processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it just saves just chilling in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of carbohydrates actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stores it up as energy and then releases
it during flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I usually feed my veg nutrients until
about two, uh, two weeks into flower so
[SPEAKER_04]: that I'm giving them more nitrogen to have
available.
[SPEAKER_04]: Should I just switch right away?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that's what I've been doing,
but mine turned yellow way too fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I'll just keep, uh, feeding that
next, that extra two weeks kind of seems
[SPEAKER_04]: to keep them green for the time that I
need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's like veganic sources of plant
nitrogens, usually amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those usually they direct you to use those
up to flush, which I've not figured out
[SPEAKER_01]: why, but it's the good nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Veganics is way different.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've grown a veganic crop with some
veganic nutrients I was given and it had
[SPEAKER_04]: the flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: It definitely had a serious flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cotton seed or soybean meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are very high and weird organic
types of nitrogens, usually amino acids
[SPEAKER_01]: and proteins.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why all these organic guys are
getting great results.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're using actually naturally
occurring, but you have to have a high,
[SPEAKER_01]: highly active, uh, myco sphere there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of bacterias and rhizomes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to be, I can't wait for Sean
to come, uh, listen to the next episode
[SPEAKER_04]: with Sean.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk a little bit about phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, phosphorus is a volatile volatile and
reactive element, which is why it is
[SPEAKER_04]: probably never found in its pure elemental
form in nature because of its volatility.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fertilizer packaging is actually showing a
measure of its oxide P two zero five.
[SPEAKER_04]: Phosphorus is commonly refined from stone
called phosphatite or mine from guano
[SPEAKER_04]: islands comprised of primarily bird and
bat droppings.
[SPEAKER_04]: A common biomass of source of phosphorus
is found in the ground bone, also known as
[SPEAKER_04]: bone meal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, cannabis plants use the phosphorus
throughout their growing cycles,
[SPEAKER_04]: but at elevated levels when flowering is
the plant's nutrient requirements change.
[SPEAKER_04]: The feeding schedule is adjusted to
include bloom foods with higher levels of
[SPEAKER_04]: phosphorus and lower levels of nitrogen
because plants also use phosphorus and
[SPEAKER_04]: root formation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Low doses of it are often found in cloning
solutions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, so phosphorus, basically, uh,
bloom foods are higher in phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_04]: phosphorus improves blood production,
uh, phosphorus aids in root development,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's involved in oil and glucose
production in the end of your blooming
[SPEAKER_04]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're actually, you want your highest
phosphorus levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few weeks before flower and like for the
first third of flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, so boost those up just like we did
with the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, the nitrogen starts to drop down
and that's when the phosphorus goes up and
[SPEAKER_01]: then towards the middle end of flower,
you want lots and lots of K.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want a very, very high last number.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about K potassium.
[SPEAKER_04]: A potassium is an alkali metal that reacts
violently with water and oxidized quite
[SPEAKER_04]: rapidly when exposed to air.
[SPEAKER_04]: This unstable nature requires that it be
added to fertilizers in the form of
[SPEAKER_04]: potassium compounds known as potash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not all forms of potash are suitable for
plants like phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Potassium is mined from mineral laden ore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, like N and P potassium, which is K is
a key component in the metabolic functions
[SPEAKER_04]: of plants and plays a large role in the
production of proteins and photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Potassium also helps strengthen the
marijuana plant's immune system when it
[SPEAKER_04]: corrects that cannabis plant's immune
system, which helps the plants cope with
[SPEAKER_04]: environmental stresses, including insects
and diseases.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bloom formulated fertilizers often include
increased levels of potassium because it
[SPEAKER_04]: helps improve flower quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, so potassium is found in both grow and
bloom fertilizers because Tony was saying
[SPEAKER_04]: that it's good towards the end of veg.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it helps the plant's immune system and
it increases flower quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll see it in most of your bloom
boosters.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be real high in potassium.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're looking for a bloom booster
and a bud hardener, that last number on
[SPEAKER_01]: the bottle, that's the one you're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: One more week.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, there's some, yeah, the, if you kick a
lot of potassium in them, it keeps them
[SPEAKER_04]: moving.
[SPEAKER_04]: It definitely keeps them from slowing
down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your plants don't get as lazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll talk a little more specifically
about when to feed things to our plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, when the plants are young,
we kind of covered this, but when the
[SPEAKER_04]: plants are young, they don't require as
much realization.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I focus on root building when the
plants are young.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mycos are your friend and enzymes are too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, we've talked about mycos and enzymes
on the show before.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll come back to that once we get all
the basics covered.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, that's your OGT.
[SPEAKER_04]: And your hygrozyme, if you guys are
looking for products, use them just like
[SPEAKER_04]: they say on the bottle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, small plants want nitrogen to grow
strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of phosphorus will help them,
uh, build roots and grow vigor,
[SPEAKER_04]: vigorously.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little potassium will keep them healthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your basic veg nutrients probably have
enough NPK to get you through your veg
[SPEAKER_04]: phase.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, if you veg for long periods,
you may need to add some calcium
[SPEAKER_04]: magnesium.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, that's something that larger plants
will start running out of.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's talk a little bit about Cal Mag
while we're here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Calcium and magnesium are what are known
as secondary nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: Calcium is a big part of the cell
structure and cellular growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Calcium stimulates enzymes that build
strong roots and cell walls.
[SPEAKER_04]: Magnesium is essential to absorb light
energy.
[SPEAKER_04]: If your plants are slow and lazy,
they may be experiencing a magnesium
[SPEAKER_04]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's certain types of a yellowing
between the veins.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's magnesium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Magnesium is actually what makes
chlorophyll green.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of humega from Organicare
will speed your plants up when they start
[SPEAKER_04]: getting lazy like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, so in the beginning you need nitrogen,
a little phosphorus and a little
[SPEAKER_04]: potassium.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, if you're looking for big roots,
definitely add some type of mycos or root
[SPEAKER_04]: inoculant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always brag about the OGT and great
white shark together.
[SPEAKER_04]: That shit works great for your roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get big fat white roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, if you feed OGT and great white shark,
along with your mix, your regular feed
[SPEAKER_04]: schedule in the morning, right when the
plants come on, if you go in about two
[SPEAKER_04]: hours later, most of your leaves will be
pointing straight up and they're praying
[SPEAKER_04]: and thanking you.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're saying, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They love that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, if your plants get a little too big
and veg, you're going to need Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you enter the flower phase,
totally like we talked about, reduce the
[SPEAKER_04]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, the first two weeks of flower won't
show you much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep the plants fed and happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I use my grow based nutrient until week
three of flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I was talking about, I feel like it
keeps them nicely, uh, nitrogened up until
[SPEAKER_04]: the end of flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I had some Cal Mag and put some
potassium silicates in, um, and also some
[SPEAKER_04]: type of kelp at week three.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a Cal Mag, potassium silicates
and kelp at week three.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll add liquid karma and sweet at week
three also.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you start week three of flower,
you can drop out most of the nitrogen and
[SPEAKER_04]: really start pumping up the P and K.
[SPEAKER_04]: Week four, I do the same thing as week
three.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we should be low on nitrogen and
pumping up the P and K.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd add some kelp and a small amount of
molasses by now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would also add some enzymes to my mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be running the whole botanic care feed
chart by week five, um, week four.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Week five is where I really pound my
plants with food.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a day 30 is where they're really
ready for sugars and boosters.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when they're really ready to get
hammered with a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've dropped the nitrogen by now and
I'm feeding heavy doses of P and K.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be adding my bloom boosters and lots
of molasses and sugars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Cal Mag would be super important for
the next couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, enzymes and kelp would also be helpful
for big tasty buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think kelp, uh, I use a lot of C plex.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think all that kelp really, uh,
adds to the stink and the density.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really adds to the, uh, some flavors,
if they have that foot, cushy skank,
[SPEAKER_04]: skunk smell, that stank, it kind of makes
them come out a little bit better if you
[SPEAKER_04]: had a lot of, uh, a lot of kelp.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, you should add some potassium
silicates for thick branches at this time,
[SPEAKER_04]: like week five, week 30 ish.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, maybe you could have put those in at
week four, but if you got good,
[SPEAKER_04]: healthy plants, I think they're cool on
week five.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just need them for, to build those
branches up a little bit while the buds
[SPEAKER_04]: grow too super thick because they're going
to start falling over.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't have some kind of tomato
cages.
[SPEAKER_04]: So week five is basically your bloom based
nutrients, lots of blood, bud boosters,
[SPEAKER_04]: sugars, enzymes, potassium silicates,
and kelp.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, week six will basically be the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Focus on your, uh, bud boosters and sugars
and get that stuff up there as high as you
[SPEAKER_04]: can without burning the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put a lot of molasses in there,
a lot of P and K products, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: and some enzymes in there to keep all of
that stuff moving.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you do the same thing up to however
long you need to go, uh, week seven,
[SPEAKER_04]: week eight, usually don't feed after week
nine.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should start flushing by week eight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most plants aren't going to go more than
10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, if you're growing a plant that takes
more than 10 weeks, I hope you're
[SPEAKER_04]: experienced and I hope all of this stuff
already makes sense to you because that's
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be, um, it's going to be a bitch
for you to grow an 11 week plant without
[SPEAKER_04]: this knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: So once you get to week eight and you've
gotten done feeding these plants and
[SPEAKER_04]: keeping them happy and healthy,
you need to flush.
[SPEAKER_04]: You, we've just talked about how much
stuff we poured into these plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, now you need to spend at least 10 to
14 days with nothing but water in these
[SPEAKER_04]: plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So on Monday, however much, if you've got
a five gallon pot, pour water through it
[SPEAKER_04]: until that shit's running through until
your tray is almost full until you're
[SPEAKER_04]: worried about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have a way to get that water out of
the tray, that's ideal and get that water
[SPEAKER_04]: out of there and let those plants sit
until they're almost dry and do the same
[SPEAKER_04]: thing all over again and do that for the
next 10 to 14 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Try to get three or four cycles of just
clean water through there so that you can
[SPEAKER_04]: push out all the nitrogen, the phosphorus,
the potassium, the calcium, the magnesium,
[SPEAKER_04]: the mycos that we just put in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to clean your soil out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to get all that stuff out of
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, if you have like really clean,
uh, really clean sorts of like molasses,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could use that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your first flush watering, uh,
quite a bit of that and, uh, sugars
[SPEAKER_01]: displace salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why all of the like clear X that
they'll sell you, uh, clear X is just a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of different types of sugars,
um, displaces salt, but it feeds all of
[SPEAKER_01]: your mycos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like basically it feeds all of them,
boosts their colonization up and then end
[SPEAKER_01]: up eating any residual food that's left.
[SPEAKER_01]: They eat a bunch of it for you,
like little garbage disposals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: He just said sugars displace salts,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: So most of the nutrients you're feeding
are salts and your plants are filled with
[SPEAKER_04]: salts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, salts don't taste so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sugar sounds like it tastes good,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you put some sugars in there when
you're flushing, it'll push the salts out
[SPEAKER_04]: of your plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll also clean up the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll break it up kind of goes in there
and stirs it around, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Feeds your hungry mycos, which is always
awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I want to go to a website.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is where I got a lot of the
information about, um, just a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: information from the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called marijuana growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: HQ.com is where I got a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also got some guidance from the
botanic care website.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'm kind of looking at their feed
charts to keep in mind what I would feed
[SPEAKER_04]: every week because I don't have my own
feed chart in my hand because it's,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, it's in the growth spaces.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't carry that around,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was a shout out to the people that
made the, the charts easy for me to figure
[SPEAKER_04]: out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they made NPK easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Easy for everyone to understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I think we should stop there on the
nutrient lessons because we're 45 minutes
[SPEAKER_04]: in 47 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think if we go any further,
we'll end up running over an hour and you
[SPEAKER_04]: potheads run out of attention span at 45
minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell how long you listen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stitcher tells me, uh, Tony can definitely
tell how long you're listening because he
[SPEAKER_04]: runs all my web stats.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we've had about 5,000 listens on the
past few episodes, which is remarkable.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank all 5,000 of you hope all
5,000 of you continue to listen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it seems like it's about time to wrap
up the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't feel like I have much more to
cover.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where was that page that I had my topics?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I covered them all.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to say we did cause I can't
find the damn paper.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had to have covered all the topics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the cannabis cup was, uh, over
Thanksgiving, uh, the vault genetics and
[SPEAKER_04]: DNA genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Crockett.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember exactly who won
everything, but big shout out to everybody
[SPEAKER_04]: that took home prizes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope everybody has a safe trip home or
the cannabis cup got raided and they shut
[SPEAKER_04]: it down.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they had to move everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no big smoke out expo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, all that they did have was the
concerts that were supposed to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope everybody got home.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope nobody got in any trouble.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so now that the show's over,
yes, the show is over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that the show is over, dude,
Tony, thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally having you on the show,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've been, it's been a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
