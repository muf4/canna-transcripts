[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode number 233 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_01]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_01]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends call me Ross to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I need to give a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_01]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks to Kat, Ku and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, White Mike is back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not very good grammar for a podcast
host.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should we give them an English lesson?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing good would mean that I am out doing
good things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm passing out food to homeless people
and I'm helping old ladies across the
[SPEAKER_01]: street.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: The world needs more of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I feel well, so I am doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: This shows off to a very odd start.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enough of the English lessons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining me today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This odd intro is brought to you by the
thermal bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the thermal banger.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about that one on the last
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I just did drop a gigantic dab of
some lemon jeffery.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call it lemon pee.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's lemon skunk, prodigium mix,
and some shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just dunked a huge ass dab of that into
some lemon jeffery, high terpene,
[SPEAKER_01]: full spectrum extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took a dab of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still a little cloudy.
[SPEAKER_01]: My head is cloudy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The room is cloudy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all matches in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, Mike and I have been working together
for a couple of weeks now.
[SPEAKER_01]: This week was fucking long, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was a crazy week at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're both pretty tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found some time to squeeze in an
episode, so we're trying to put one
[SPEAKER_00]: together for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you can tell, this is a little
stumbly already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike sounds like he's half asleep over
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a hell of a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: My brain does the thing where terps make
it go brrrr and I just start going faster
[SPEAKER_01]: and I wake up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I feel like I get so much shit
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys look at me at work sometimes
like, are you going to stop because you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to fall over if you don't?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just keep going and just smoke
another dab, get it done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining me, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, if you want to follow Mike on
social media, you can check him out on the
[SPEAKER_01]: Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's at Nemopunk15 and then on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you even check your Instagram?
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, because I've tagged you in a couple
of really killer posts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, most of them have been liked by me.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the Instagram, he's also Nemopunk15.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, what you should really follow is
his Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_01]: On Facebook, he is Pueblo for sensible
cannabis laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: He supports sensible cannabis laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's here in our town, Pueblo,
Colorado, and you should check him out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He kind of trolls some other cannabis
pages.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a little trolly lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll own that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's Mike against a whole army of
fucking admins on these pages.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's me against the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Mike just slays them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's easy because prohibition is
just an idiotic concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm starting off where it's like we're
playing chess.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get one pawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get all your pieces too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those people are so gullible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, they're not very good at what
they're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: All passion, no willingness to do their
homework.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're calling all the dads green crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crack weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green crack weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you walk into a dispensary and go,
God, I need that crack weed, then you get
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the best looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're pretty sure that's our
favorite new thing in the world is that
[SPEAKER_00]: crack weed because we need our weed fix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our weed fix.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say it's hallucinogenic and it causes
us to act like zombies and become out of
[SPEAKER_01]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I wish some of the effects they
prescribed to cannabis were real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of that sounds fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all the time, but for a long weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're confused.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're smoking DMT or something because I
don't feel any of the effects they talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about when I smoke a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just took a pretty chunky dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of it is terminology and where
they're getting it from.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole psychosis thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being unable to accurately gauge time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how long we've been sitting at this
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do that along with one or two other
little things, very similar to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we would call being stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: A psychologist might call feeling the
effects of psychosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're a little detached.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheetos are funnier than they should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't that happen when you drink alcohol
as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: They need a better word for intoxication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they came up with a number of
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then soccer mom reads it when they
Google pop bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they decide that people are taking a
dab and then just losing their minds and
[SPEAKER_00]: doing the craziest shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they spend all day looking for
news articles that back this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I find myself in the awkward position
of explaining that marijuana isn't this
[SPEAKER_00]: magical thing that prevents bad things
from happening to people who are near it
[SPEAKER_00]: or using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that horrible things happen to people
just randomly because that's life and life
[SPEAKER_00]: is unfair.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just because you happen to be
near marijuana when that horrible thing
[SPEAKER_00]: occurred doesn't mean those two events are
necessarily related.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's just something that I see a
lot that I end up like, oh, this is really
[SPEAKER_00]: touchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a sad tragic story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how do I separate and gently say like
marijuana doesn't prevent tragedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at the numbers the other
way, it's also clearly not causing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot to digest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was making sure there was a lot of
information there and I'm pretty big.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you had flipped one at one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you had said the wrong one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you got it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You brought it back around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's what I was doing before I came
over to podcast, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you thinking about that speech?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I was writing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually a beautiful I didn't plan
on bringing this up on the show just
[SPEAKER_00]: because he took us there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a beautiful op ed in the Denver
Post right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: By Jeffrey Mirren, who if you're into
cannabis policy at all, you've seen in
[SPEAKER_00]: clips like in the culture high documentary
and a couple other documentaries or videos
[SPEAKER_00]: of that nature, talking about the
economics of prohibition and the policy
[SPEAKER_00]: from that perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an economics professor at Harvard
talking about how you attack the black
[SPEAKER_00]: market and you can't stomp away the black
market because it's economically driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's demand, there will always be
supply period.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always an apartment building with
some dude just selling five or ten dollar
[SPEAKER_01]: bags of weed just to get by.
[SPEAKER_00]: The harder you try to stomp something out,
the more risky supplying it becomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more profitable supplying it becomes,
the more incentivized supplying it
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes, the harder you try to get rid of
it, the more you encourage people to
[SPEAKER_00]: supply it is essentially how it works
economically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with marijuana prohibition,
like you can't see this in the numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: that we pay for weed just as consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twenty years ago, when we were trying a
lot harder to stamp it out, it was a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of us had trouble finding it or
buying it or consuming it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we paid a lot more to do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know what herb costs at a
dispensary right now in Colorado?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very so wildly from shop to shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're paying anywhere between like
twenty five and fifty five and eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I went to kind love.
[SPEAKER_01]: About a year ago and I bought a quarter
and it was seventy five dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's I think that's on the expensive
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're one of the more bougie shops and
they charge a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was seventy five for a quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eighty percentile price range.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember a time when it was one hundred
and twenty, one hundred and twenty five a
[SPEAKER_01]: quarter and a quarter would weigh six and
a half grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to have to tell people that it was
one hundred and twenty something,
[SPEAKER_00]: something, something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember the one hundred and
twenty whatever and change.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I would say with and with tax
that comes to and then I'd have to hit
[SPEAKER_00]: them with that number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was like one hundred forty and
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people would look at me and be like,
well, it's legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mind paying an extra forty six
bucks over what I'd pay back in Texas or
[SPEAKER_00]: wherever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'd just throw down their money and
roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when you're shopping at the
dispensary, you don't mind paying the
[SPEAKER_01]: taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a security guard looking at you,
making sure you're not getting robbed by
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a guy weighing it in front of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's going to weigh.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the best parts of the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you get a lot more for that tax
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The safety, selection, lab testing,
consistency, quality, ease of purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to sit there and watch how
it's made for two hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to sit there and listen to
his new ukulele solo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, check out this fish video.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, I know you want a bag,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get your bag in a minute,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch this fish solo, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch Trey tear it up, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, bro, I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch the video, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're talking over fish, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trey's doing it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't miss those days at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you don't miss college trying to buy
weed or just set it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, man, you know, can I just swing by
after work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, it's been a long week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sure?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be by like nine thirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You walk in the door and you get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my down the hall neighbor has been kind
of bitchy lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you could hang out for like at least
like an hour and 20, like I'd really love
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Friday night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to get a weed and go home and
get a sandwich and take a shower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we going to do for an hour and 20
hour?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're we're going to watch cops really
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we're going to smoke my weed while we
fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I don't miss that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull over, pull over into the parking lot
like you do at any of the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walk in like you do at any of the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Point at what you want like at any of the
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay for it like at any of the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a home like at any other store.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no part of the black market I
miss.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at least when I was that guy back in
the day, because I used to be that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, man, you should hang out, man,
for at least like 30 minutes, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would just keep packing bowls.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I would get you to stay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just get you so high you can't leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to look like a loafing jug.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a lot of different ways to do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I knew one dude who was always making
like grub little snacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it wasn't just like you want some
chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was always like celery with peanut
butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: With raisins sprinkled over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was always like the next step.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ants on a log, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, full on dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I would buy weed from that guy just
because he had ants on a log with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a she and it was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, the ladies take good care of us
and try to feed us snacks, take good care
[SPEAKER_01]: of us, keep us nourished.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shots of the ladies taking care of the men
feeding us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was always a little healthy snack wise,
but it was always a really nice treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you got to sit and chill somewhere
for that long, might as well have some
[SPEAKER_00]: grub.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a guy would be like, I got pizza
and a scent and a beer, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least ladies got some ants on a log for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two warm beers next to the fridge,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might eat that crust though,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That pizza crust.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fuck did we smoke, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're weird today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it was a lot of hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, it was a really long week.
[SPEAKER_00]: We crushed it this week, but God invented
weekends for a reason so we can recover
[SPEAKER_00]: from weeks like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a good weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to a humble brag, I guess tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to work a little bit tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to go into the grill and handle a
couple of small things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I have a lot of small things,
they're clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a whole bunch of small things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whole tray of tiny things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got to go take care of a bunch of
clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm going to come home and clean
up and chill out for a few and head up to
[SPEAKER_01]: Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to go see the awesome Steve
Simone at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody listens to the show frequently,
they know me, they know how much of a
[SPEAKER_01]: comedy fan I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you know Steve Simone, Steve Simone
doesn't use much profanity.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a really good, smiley, positive dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a good positive attitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just puts me in a good mood.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dude can do, I'd say an hour,
two hours on Chinese food.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a bit about Chinese food.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really good bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to burn it and do it,
that's just this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Google Steve Simone, it's spelled
funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: S-I-M, I'm trying to, it's Simeone is what
it looks like, but it's Steve Simone.
[SPEAKER_01]: S-I-M-E-O-N-E.
[SPEAKER_01]: S-I-M, I'm not sure anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Question for Google.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Google Steve Simone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Google will help you out, but he's going
to be funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be the dude who looks funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big Italian dude with the big head and
the big smile.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't use any profanity.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a podcast called Good Times with
Steve Simone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's produced and co-hosted by the good
dude, Lee Syatt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that guy a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I'm stoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to go see some comedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be the beginning of the
summer of chaos.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about to start for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got one, two, three comedy shows,
then three fish shows in a row,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then another comedy show between now
and September 4th.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a lot of miles on the
car, but it's going to be a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got nothing planned until one evening
in December, and then I've got nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: planned until Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: December.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin Smith's coming to Pueblo,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not even, it's September right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, I've got a two-year-old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, then you've got a lot of cool shit
to look forward to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to work, get home, make sure there's
laundry for tomorrow, clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the big doing stuff night of my
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I live the Malamute lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take some of that with me wherever I go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smell like weed and I trail dog hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you get when you order me.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you order a mic, he comes with half
of a Malamute attached to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just no other way to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got some Mick the dog fur on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Mick the dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody's listened to the podcast for a
long time, they remember the time I kicked
[SPEAKER_01]: Mick the dog on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got emails about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fucking sorry, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was under the table, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: He kept moving, and I moved my foot and I
got him, and you could hear a little
[SPEAKER_01]: whimper on the show, and I was like,
I'm fucking sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't call PETA.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show's produced really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: These mics are awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it heard me stomp on Mick the dog on
accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a good boy, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: He jumped up into my lap the last time we
hung out, like just cuddled up in my lap,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a little, I don't know, I felt like a
little fucking kangaroo laying in my lap.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how people don't have dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a dog of my own because I'm
in too many grows and I don't like my grow
[SPEAKER_01]: hair, my dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, but like you're dog people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you could, you would.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just go to other people's houses and
just then I get, I don't have to pick up
[SPEAKER_01]: shit or buy food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get to play with doggos all the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And dogs like me, cause I'm just a hippie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to go hippie at heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they come up to me and they're like,
oh, hey, look at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, gotta have one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a little crushed after my dog died.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to do that again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to do that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a while to get back at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I just know that I know it's,
maybe it's a shitty attitude that I know
[SPEAKER_01]: that about 10 years after I get it,
I got to feel that way again.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dog died again.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like one of the shittiest
feelings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can, I can dodge that by not doing that
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go play with everyone else's dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the grow from your dog podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, uh, this, this podcast is brought
to you by hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_01]: They hashtag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do, I'm going to suggest we
take another dad before we get into
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever topic you have lined up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take in a dad, but while we
get it lined up here, let's talk a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit about what's, uh, what I wanted to
talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's kind of give it a little preset so
that we can fucking talk about it before
[SPEAKER_01]: we lose our shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Nancy Budwell.
[SPEAKER_01]: She asked me a question on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is a great grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should be following Nancy Budwell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, great photography.
[SPEAKER_01]: She just sent me a Facebook message.
[SPEAKER_01]: My phone just lit up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were having a great conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: She does some beautiful photography,
beautiful photography.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's, uh, she hasn't been growing for
super long, but the amount of time that
[SPEAKER_01]: she grew has been growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: She came up really fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good job, Nancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so I wanted to talk about,
uh, so people think like you work in a
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial group, you grow weed all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You must be smoking weed all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just hanging out, listening to Bob
Marley with a fucking spliff blazing,
[SPEAKER_01]: get the fucking air conditioner on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in a, on a sofa.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got cushy chairs, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When people hear legal weed, they tend to
picture in their head where they bought
[SPEAKER_00]: weed in college being a profession now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that is not at all the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, um, I've shuffled more paperwork now
than I have any other job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Paperwork is the fucking word I have
written down on my list here just to think
[SPEAKER_01]: about, to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the past, I've worked for, or worked
with like locked up teenagers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked for NIDA as a subcontractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like I've had some major jobs that
required insane amounts of record keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: and regulation and rule following.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've never had anywhere close to the
level of paperwork I have at this place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes people are like, so what'd you
do today?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, well, I put a hundred clones
from the clone dome into pots and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: like a hundred.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, oh yeah, but I had to write down
every single one and an RFID tag number
[SPEAKER_01]: and a mother plant number and the date and
the name of the stream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: On multiple sheets of paper, one for us
and one for the, the it's called the
[SPEAKER_01]: department of ag slash metric,
uh, the marijuana, something tracking some
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but I have to write down a copy for us
and then we have to document it for
[SPEAKER_01]: metric.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have to make a sticker for each
plant and there is so much paperwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after I, so I write down that
I've just put whatever we'll say 25 blue
[SPEAKER_01]: dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's pick blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just took 25 blue dream clones from the
clone dome into, they go into four by four
[SPEAKER_01]: square pots with a soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm throwing that into there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to write down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just did 25 of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: They came from mother plant number 56,
53.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm making shit up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did it on the date was seven 10 and.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then Mike has to go put those into the
computer and then there's a first,
[SPEAKER_00]: we write it down on a sheet of paper
because I'm in a whole nother area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we take that and transfer into a
computer system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we actually physically do that with
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's just, it's there's three steps
where there's only one necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if y'all ever watched the show
moonshiners, there's an episode where fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: nuts in the overalls is trying to get
legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck nuts in the overalls on the moonshine
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that narrows it down to the,
I know that narrows the cast way down,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, uh, they're talking about getting
legal and he's getting his legal moonshine
[SPEAKER_00]: business up and running.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Tim, Tim, Tim.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was tickle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole episode pickle tickle was a
tickle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was tickle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole show is totally fake,
but the, the little story they were trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to tell was at least plausible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the whole gripe during the going legal
section was how much paperwork is
[SPEAKER_00]: involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm just used to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do I got to write it down four times?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, because it's legal now,
let's list off the agencies that oversee
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's the department of revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the marijuana enforcement
division.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the department of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the IRS, there's state,
local and federal law enforcement
[SPEAKER_00]: agencies, the fire department,
the health department, the health
[SPEAKER_01]: department, um, the building inspectors,
uh, code enforcement, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: building inspector city code enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or county code enforcement, depending on
your location.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's yearly inspections,
quarterly inspections, monthly trainings,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, policy change memos, rule book updates
from all of them, all eight of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's so much involved with being
legal, just like any other legal business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I imagine some of this is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're trying to open a taco truck
from just driving around, selling
[SPEAKER_00]: burritos, goes out of the back of your
Subaru, but like with legal cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: we went so overboard with a lot of the
rules and regulations that like sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: we have to stop and note shit in the
system that happens in the same room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we didn't do anything, but like
change the container it was in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and if we move a plant from one spot
to another, we got to mark that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's in a certain spot in the room or a
certain area, some facilities have little
[SPEAKER_01]: RFID tags and little trackers so that if
you move through a certain area,
[SPEAKER_01]: it just tags it for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plant knows that now you went from
room A to room B, but we don't,
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't really have that yet,
but we will in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that's even necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not necessary, but it would be nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would save three steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would save clicks, save you having to
click when you do 150 plants at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is so much paperwork in a commercial
grow you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just the start of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, there was a saying that was going
around a lot during the election season in
[SPEAKER_00]: this area last year that we're in the
compliance business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we do that well, we get to sell
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I agree a hundred percent with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of what we do all day is compliance
and regulation oriented.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smallest amount of our, our tasks
every day are production and distribution
[SPEAKER_00]: of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of our waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: So imagine you harvest a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike just starts laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your average marijuana plant in a
production facility is probably going to
[SPEAKER_00]: weigh in somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what the hell they're doing
in any other facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to talk to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, in our facility,
you're looking at several, like 1200,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2000 grams, 3000 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the plant first gets cut down,
that's it's wet weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's fully harvested in, in bag
ready, you might have 300 grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the difference there, all of that has
to be accounted for, even though most of
[SPEAKER_00]: it's water weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then whatever physical hard trash you
have left, like the stems, the dried up
[SPEAKER_00]: fan leaves, all of that you have to make
unrecognizable is plant matter,
[SPEAKER_00]: not as marijuana, but as plant matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to be destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next time y'all mow your lawn,
that big pile of grass clippings you get
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if you had to make that not appear
like plant matter in your trash can at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now imagine that we haul out like 40 bags
like that a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just throwing away our trash is a
nightmare.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, uh, there's several ways to make it
unrecognizable.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the leaf stuff we'll mix in with
old dirt or cocoa or old perlite.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll just mix it in with the bag and stir
it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now it's like mulched in there with all
the leaves and the dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's unrecognizable.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's destroyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the sticks, you can't really do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we run all the sticks through an actual
wood chipper on the weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a guy, a strapping young lad will
fire up a big wood chipper, like an
[SPEAKER_01]: industrial grade chipper and run sticks
for, he takes half the shift to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he'll just chip it up all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that stuff, all of the unrecognizable
waste then has to be locked in an approved
[SPEAKER_01]: locked trash container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dumpster inspections, y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your dumpster has to be inspected.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to have a padlock on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't be able to break into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the dumpster gets inspected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of that's because some fucking
tweaker went on the news way back when it
[SPEAKER_00]: was like, what we do for money is break
into dispensary dumpsters and blast their
[SPEAKER_00]: trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the press ran with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nonsense.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all knew it was nonsense when it aired,
but the rest of the world didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now we have a special rule where
every couple of months an inspector comes
[SPEAKER_00]: out and digs through our garbage to make
sure none of it looks like plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's just, yuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalization is a totally different level.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually broken into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked at three facilities and all of
them have had the trash broken into at
[SPEAKER_01]: least once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bad press makes people think there might
be something in there worth trying to get
[SPEAKER_00]: at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green and healthy, the girl was down at
the end of an alley and they would break
[SPEAKER_01]: into that fucking thing once a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like once a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: We probably didn't even need trash
service.
[SPEAKER_01]: We probably could have just canceled the
dumpster because they would just come get
[SPEAKER_01]: our shit every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, there's a bunch of dudes that
work there and our favorite thing to do is
[SPEAKER_01]: eat Thai food.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would all order Thai food together and
just fucking, it was just all Thai food
[SPEAKER_01]: trash.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do they think we're going to throw
away?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like weed or we're in the weed business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like anything usable is either getting
sold or extracted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anything's going to happen,
it's not going to go in the dumpster.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the dipshit trimmers would probably
steal it or something before they throw it
[SPEAKER_01]: away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would, like, why do they think it's
even going to make it to the trash?
[SPEAKER_00]: The only place that works is like
restaurants guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't go through the trash at the mall
looking for Levi's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, you're the winner.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't go through the trash looking for
Levi's.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might find a sandwich or a half a
pretzel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you might find food, but you're not
going to find like useful products from a
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are pretty high, aren't we?
[SPEAKER_01]: You said dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get you a dab here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're smoking a little bit of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's going to be that kind of show
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were hoping to learn a lot about
growing cannabis this episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: feel free to send, Hey Mel, the Nemo Punk
15.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at 233 episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I have given myself some leeway to
get high and chill out with one of my best
[SPEAKER_00]: friends on a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me recommend episode 36 and 67.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just picked two numbers at random,
but I'm pretty sure at least one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: two is going to holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like your approach there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a, that's a good little segue and
time for a plug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Old episodes are now available on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, if you go to YouTube
and search for the grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast, uh, I think approximately 75
episodes are up on YouTube right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a weekend coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to work over the weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a lot to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may launch a couple more videos pretty
soon, but by the time you hear this,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guarantee there's 75 videos up on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're not, I just, did that fly fly
into my mouth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I feel like it did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just ate a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like a carnivore bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it was weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: They put a little dry spot on my face.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw it and then I was like, I went to go
walk, wife wafted away and I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: where'd it go?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just ate, I just ate a little skeeter
net or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen on the show,
not going to edit this at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad these mic covers are clean bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a hint what I was saying.
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, by, uh, yeah, yeah, by all means
go check out the YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just ate a fucking bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a showstopper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to let you chew on that bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to hand me that torture?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll heat this up for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will heat up this, uh, this thermal
banger for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bubble cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to tell you, I was kind of skeptical
skeptical about the thermal banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first good dab I got off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't even my own dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff took one of Jeff's dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: His eyes started to roll back and he was
had about the sixth rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: He took out of the bucket and he just kind
of looked at me, shrugged and handed me
[SPEAKER_00]: the rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I took two good rips out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He hit it with the torch again and then
handed it back and I got like six more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I put a little more hash in
there than I probably should have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this bucket with this cap hits like
several trucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of it is that rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people, so there's controversy in
the fucking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Industry and in the cannabis scene,
people are lovers or haters of the hitman
[SPEAKER_01]: glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to stay out of all of that politics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I appreciate that that glass rig
functions and hits like a goddamn Mack
[SPEAKER_01]: truck going down the highway that didn't
even see you and just thump.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of my favorite rigs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my go-to rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had to grab a rig to take a dab out
of, that'd be the first one I go for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a hammerhead.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a hitman hammerhead sidecar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Mike is just choking and it's got
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little more heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll reheat you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to, I went in a little cold,
which is why I am able to speak to you
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm asking for more fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spin the, uh, the cap a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: You spin the capital.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that would be awkward.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got you a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should probably hotter than shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's turning colors over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's wanting to grow from your heart
hoodie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now he matches the red in the word
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's giving me devil horns.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is going to live.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, do you remember what the hell we
were talking about just a second ago?
[SPEAKER_00]: Episode 36 and 67.
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we got past that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we got past telling everybody to
look at YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about the thermal banger change
in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we talked about the thermal bangers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talking about the hitman rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hitman rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about the controversy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't follow that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this particular, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The hammerhead sidecar?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I see on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the, the stem comes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see that you cleaned it today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just dumped it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just dumped it out so we didn't have to
smoke through the clog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get a golf ball, a reclaimed
built in the bottom of this thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: it tends to hit a little slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the function on it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's small.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fist sized.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sturdy and stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like a small dab rig because a bong,
the idea with the bong is to fill it up
[SPEAKER_01]: with weed smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're smoking, you're lighting it,
you're pulling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got smoke filling up in that big ass
tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when it's time, you pull the carb
or you pull the bowl out is what you do at
[SPEAKER_01]: the net with the futuristic bong with the
bong of today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You pull the slide and the smoke goes into
your lungs and then you just get high,
[SPEAKER_01]: straight to the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you're smoking a dab,
there's no need to fill a giant chamber.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to smoke a liter of oxygen,
no liter of cola before I start getting
[SPEAKER_01]: myself a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: This little rig, it goes through the
banger down that little stem into the
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Kapow!
[SPEAKER_00]: Right in the kiss up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need a ton of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need a ton of room in the glass
for the vapor coming off the bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: A nice small rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: My trip is stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first two rigs were real unstable and
no matter what you put on them were top
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that leads to panically trying to grab
a rig as it's tipping or falling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the panic grab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you end up with a nice brand on
your hand from where you grab the hot leg.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just no need for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it's nice and stable like this,
it's just so nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got two Hitman rigs on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're both nice and stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love the flared out mouthpiece.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, okay, Hitman.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good advertisement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about no controversy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just likes what I likes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so well, there's a lot of stupid
controversy in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Hitman controversy doesn't bother me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like what that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you guys picking shit on dumb
shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're haters because people like them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Worry about shit that matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's how you know you're doing all
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just go by how many people fucking
do not like you for no stupid reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been going for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to read an email?
[SPEAKER_00]: We should.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's read one email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got it sitting right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's from a guy from Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see bullet points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Props to the dude from Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to skim and see if we're
supposed to say his name or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always a good idea to put that at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen, I heard that in the last email
episode, that's how somebody started it
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this guy starts and if he gets to
his name, I'll just try to remember to
[SPEAKER_01]: skip it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if not, we'll use the wonderful magic
of editing with something super Canadian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude's name that's super Canadian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we just call him Gretzky?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's see if he signed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just go to the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying not to go with somebody's
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's call him Canuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Canuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canuck.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up Canuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, Dear Rasta Jeff, I'm writing from
Canada near Toronto.
[SPEAKER_01]: About two months ago, we set up a two by
two hydroponic grow cabinet under an LED.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: The setup is not ideal, but even with
legal recreational cannabis coming to
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada by July, 2018, there is a social
stigma associated with the recreational
[SPEAKER_01]: pot use here that would make it important
for us to remain discreet and secure and
[SPEAKER_01]: stealth with our grow for this foreseeable
future, even after legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, there's people around.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just can't let know, which is
understandable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because it's legal and the cops ain't
looking no more doesn't mean the rippers
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe he's got family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe he's got a job.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know who this guy is or what he's
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe he runs a business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he'll lose his clientele if they know
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plenty of other people around to hate,
even if it's legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't all be Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm blessed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he goes on and he says, I know you
don't want to encourage illegal activity,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if you did some podcasts on subjects
for stealth indoor grows, it would help
[SPEAKER_01]: people like me that will be growing
legally next year, but have to keep quiet
[SPEAKER_01]: about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, excuse me, like every new grower,
my wife and I have read everything we can,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can get our hands on to help.
[SPEAKER_01]: We visited Hydro stores and we've asked a
lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're already on the right path,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're listening to a good podcast and
you're reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of people skip that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just go to growing and then they buy
the books later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Setting yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, learning from your experience on
the podcast has made it so much easier to
[SPEAKER_01]: sort through the bullshit that is out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's why I do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've said before that part of why
I did it is because the internet is full
[SPEAKER_01]: of shit and it sucks that people are
getting misled by the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're ruining grows because some guys
said to pour coffee grounds and Dr. Pepper
[SPEAKER_01]: into your plant and it would make it grow
more colas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they tried it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they just got ants and a dead plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen way meaner shit posted as
like polite suggestions too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the email keeps going.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, over the past three months,
I have binge listened to all of the grow
[SPEAKER_01]: from your heart podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to going back over
them again.
[SPEAKER_01]: This time to take notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to give me a lot of clicks in
the ratings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to have to keep traveling
back in time somehow because there are
[SPEAKER_01]: more episodes coming out and stuff falls
out of the Stitcher feeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to start checking
them out on YouTube because YouTube videos
[SPEAKER_01]: don't disappear over time, no matter how
many I add.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a cool little thing I realized
there one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll take me a minute, but I'll get
them all up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got 85 videos made.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 75 posted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take a long time to make and post.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just ties up my computer for however
long the video is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes about three times that long to
post it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's an hour, it's going to take
three hours to post it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I get to these three hour videos,
I don't know if YouTube's going to explode
[SPEAKER_01]: or what might happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of great stuff in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more to this email, but before we
go too far, I want to back up and talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about some of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A two by two hydro grow under an led and a
cabinet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty stealth, pretty smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like we talked about very good idea to
stay discreet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to tell anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll keep you much safer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, we won't encourage illegal
activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's an adult and this only applies
to people doing things in legal places.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big kudos on reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you're doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the compliments on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's see, it's time to take notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now he says we've made some classic
mistakes and this guy is maybe it's a gal.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you said my wife.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it still could be a gal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is so confusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This non-binary listener.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're in the future now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our listener friend, Canuck says we've
made some classic mistakes and I'm,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm proud of them for just admitting their
mistakes right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a cool way to open up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that gives you integrity right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: A sour diesel was probably not a good
choice for a cabinet grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, he gave it right away because he
just envisioned Cole is like three feet
[SPEAKER_01]: tall and a two foot grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two weeks into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's trying to lift that light up for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're just going, oh shit,
what are we going to do now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the saw honey.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to raise the roof and they continue
with, we didn't know what we didn't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we've learned firsthand about
relentless, scrogging, super cropping,
[SPEAKER_01]: trimming and topping to keep them shorter
than the lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's one way to learn and you
won't make that mistake again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you know what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, some bending and popping isn't as bad
as it looks like it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes there are plants that are three
or four weeks into flower and I will walk
[SPEAKER_01]: by them and give them a little twist and
just give them a little pop on the main
[SPEAKER_01]: cola and they'll bend over for two or
three days, but then they'll grow right
[SPEAKER_01]: back up and they'll be even stronger than
they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now the canopy is a little more even.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not getting up away from the
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just, it helps them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's good for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this dude tried to grow sour diesel in
a small space and learned a lot because he
[SPEAKER_01]: was forced to.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good way to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, oh shit, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the book and check is a great way to
learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy sounds like a smart person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure he was like, watch this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll bend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes on and says, we started off with
RO water and learned about nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: The girls are all better now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're using RO water, you're going
to get more deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, because the RO water is cleaning
everything out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to add everything
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: The municipal water is a little more
balanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and already it's got more pieces
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's, well, there's already
calcium and magnesium in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you start off with RO, you have to
add everything yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just all at zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, then he goes on and says, we started
condensing and pulling on the concrete
[SPEAKER_01]: floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: The room where we kept the cabinet is now
power vented to the outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did not anticipate the humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't realize that every drop of
water you pour into that plant to water is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to come back out of the leaves and
it's going to stay in that place.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have some way to get rid of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I talk about building grows,
I talk so much about air exchange and
[SPEAKER_01]: airflow, airflow, airflow, fresh air in
all there out, do it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something people don't think about,
um, as important.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think light and food.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't think about air and an air
conditioner.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to cool it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to bring any fresh air in
or put any CO2 in there or get that old
[SPEAKER_01]: stale funky air out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's, I mean, the humidity is a
major issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: When, uh, when you read about black market
grows being destructive, the two points
[SPEAKER_00]: that the police always bitch about are
mold and wiring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want a fire and then you've
destroyed the house by making it moldy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even when people step up and hire a
good electrician to come in and wire the
[SPEAKER_00]: house properly or get proper wiring to the
grow, they often skimp on, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: air in and out because it's an easy way to
tip off the neighbors that you're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: is when you vent out the window or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that vent there becomes a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why does it smell so dank over there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why isn't there any snow for about four
feet right here by this window,
[SPEAKER_00]: by the basement?
[SPEAKER_00]: A beautiful picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was taken in Holland to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just house after house after house
and they're all covered with snow except
[SPEAKER_00]: for one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's perfectly dry roof and it's like,
man, what's going on over there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone's got some grow lights in the
attic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you remember the house we used to
drive by all the time where it was just
[SPEAKER_00]: metal halide blue for days out of that one
garage window?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was too obvious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you guys got to be a little more
careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's keep going with the email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you realize it's going to get too
humid in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you did not get powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: The email keeps going.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says the plan is forgiving and we're
having a blast watching the flowers
[SPEAKER_01]: develop.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're already making plans for the second
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're having so much fun and can't wait to
use our homegrown medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: A small hydro cabinet under LED is about
as far as we can get from how your ...
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me correct myself here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may have to edit.
[SPEAKER_01]: A small hydro cabinet grow under LED is
about as far as we can get from how you
[SPEAKER_01]: grow, but your help has been invaluable
beyond what you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, everything is applicable in a certain
way and it sounds like you're super smart
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to- I was going to say it's not
that different than how you have grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just hydro and LED.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you've got plants under lights and
you're feeding them nutrients and taking
[SPEAKER_01]: care of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to scrog them and take care of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to trim them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully you did some defoliating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because it's small and you don't have
a bunch of stuff doesn't mean you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have the heart and that you're doing it as
hard as I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going as hard as me, man,
because honestly, I'm going to put my
[SPEAKER_01]: paper down and I'm going to talk about
some real shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing it where it's not legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going way harder than me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to play easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to drive to a place with a hundred
lights that's got fucking security cameras
[SPEAKER_01]: that everyone ... We talked about 18
organizations have come in and said,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got all 18 of those organizations
are up your ass, plus your neighbors,
[SPEAKER_01]: plus the thieves, plus whoever you're
trying to be discreet from, plus those
[SPEAKER_01]: people also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, props to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing it harder than me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one LED is way more balls than
whatever hundreds of lights I've ever ran.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got respect for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't ever think that you're not doing it
just as hard as us because we're pussies
[SPEAKER_01]: here doing it legally.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one thing I laugh at is when people
talk about how good they grow or how well
[SPEAKER_01]: they grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had this conversation earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: When people try to show off their weed,
and I'm like, how long you been at this?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, oh, right when it got legal,
I got my card.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, people have been doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were able to pull that off in basements
where we only rented the house long enough
[SPEAKER_01]: to just blow it up and to get fucking a
crop out and then have to tear it down and
[SPEAKER_01]: leave because it got suspicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were pulling out cup one and crops and
amazing crops and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it's funny now that people are like,
yeah, I've just got my non-discreet,
[SPEAKER_01]: just wide open grow in my house that you
can hear down the block just going,
[SPEAKER_02]: boom, boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, all right, good weed,
bro, but man, it's so easy now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, we give you props for having the
balls to do so in a place that's not as
[SPEAKER_01]: safe as our location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada's on their way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really looked at the,
because they're not final yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not even really down to- I thought
their new dude was- Their new- Prime
[SPEAKER_00]: Minister?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Prime Minister.
[SPEAKER_00]: Justin Trudeau?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see him, but yeah, it took me a
minute to pull his name out of my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did run on essentially not, this wasn't
his main platform talking point,
[SPEAKER_00]: but on a legalization platform and has
pledged to legalize cannabis by some day
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what that looks like, what the final
rules are going to be, none of that's
[SPEAKER_00]: really been finalized yet, like including
the minimum age to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a big to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The group of people that were appointed to
kick out recommendations came back with
[SPEAKER_00]: the 18 is the age age limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all the big prohibitionists that
have been kind of gaining momentum over
[SPEAKER_00]: the last year or so since the rise of
Trump are really freaked out because,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh my God, the US is bad enough with
Colorado and Oregon, Washington and Alaska
[SPEAKER_00]: and allowing a 21, the whole country is
going to be 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just over the border and oh my God,
it's yeah, it's marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not guns.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even fucking bungee jumping or
caffeine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cops are more dangerous than cannabis.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: By far.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's ever been shot by cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: No marijuana plant has ever gotten scared
and shot a teenager in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I meant to say that on a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Stony, y'all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be that time of the year
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So speaking of shooting people,
don't shoot people over your weed crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a random gear shift right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't shoot people over your weed crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still doing this dude's email,
so don't get too far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get too far out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I like your little setup,
little closet grozer where it's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start with a two by two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's just producing enough for himself
and his wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I thought when we were
reading your email is don't be afraid to
[SPEAKER_00]: go with tiny plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much you're looking to
produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or wanting to produce, but you can start
the flowering phase pretty much any time
[SPEAKER_00]: after the clone phase and produce a fully
flowered finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a Sativa that would,
like if you gave it some more time and
[SPEAKER_00]: veg, be a serious height problem,
you can still flower out a tiny one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tiny one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or all like this dude's already learned,
he can scrog it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trick is to learn how to, and I've
done an episode on scrogging, I think
[SPEAKER_01]: recently, the trick is to learn how to get
a screen and spread that small space out
[SPEAKER_01]: and get as much vertical space as you can
get instead of horizontal to where every,
[SPEAKER_01]: you got two feet by two feet, maybe like
every four inches, you got a little tiny
[SPEAKER_01]: cola.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe three, to get the three and a half
inch net.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that'd be pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: The three and a half inch net and just try
to put, just flatten the plant out a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit and try to get one little small
node coming out of every one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would really maximize your grow
space in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm going to keep moving with the
email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And man, going hard as us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was impressed with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, it's also been helpful to hear
Mike's work and the local efforts for
[SPEAKER_01]: sensible legalization, the Canadian
government.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I want to read this while
you're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I saw that, I was like, Hey,
we're going to do this one while Mike's
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Canadian government has said that they
are going to make recreational cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: legal, but they have been a little light
on what the rules are going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the rules develop, I hope we will be
able to be guided by the hard work already
[SPEAKER_01]: done in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really want that to be true that
people like you need to get on it now,
[SPEAKER_00]: the conversations about what the rules
might not be able to based on,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm assuming he may not be able to,
you may have to hang out in the shadows
[SPEAKER_01]: based on his need to be discreet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada's been kind of less dickish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'd be a good way to put it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada just seems less dickish than a lot
of places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada already smoked a joint,
chilled the fuck out apparently.
[SPEAKER_00]: A long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: They learned that if you're nice to your
neighbor, your neighbor is usually nice to
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they've allowed a considerable bit
more public input.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, much like it is over here,
they've got elected representation that
[SPEAKER_00]: they can send emails to, make phone calls
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's always like, have your snowy
friend who doesn't have anything to lose
[SPEAKER_00]: sign the letter for you.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always, I'll do all that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put my full name on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody knows I'm a cannabis supporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not above writing a draft letter
saying, you know, dear Senator so-and-so,
[SPEAKER_00]: please vote this way on this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sending it around to all my
friends and being like, it doesn't matter
[SPEAKER_00]: who your Senator is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copy and paste this, go to this website,
click on the button for your area code.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kicks out who your Senator is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click the blue button next to their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does everything else for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copy and paste this into the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little email box right next to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a piece of mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Click on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the conversations in Canada about what
the rules are going to be, what
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization is going to start out as or
look like initially are being had now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people in power right now are going to
be making those decisions very soon and
[SPEAKER_00]: encouraging them to really look at
Colorado's model, where it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things we didn't plan for originally that
we've since learned about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting those implementations off the
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, I really like our advertising
rules here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that I don't have to listen to open
ads on the radio.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure a lot of companies would love to
advertise, but I'm fine with advertising
[SPEAKER_00]: bans for anything with a certain
percentage of readership under whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: age.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fine with the packaging requirements
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that everything's sold in
well-labeled child-proof packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish other things that I buy in the
world that are harmful to people who don't
[SPEAKER_00]: understand them or shouldn't be consuming
them were packaged like this that aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If fucking no-dos were sold like this,
I think fewer kids would die from caffeine
[SPEAKER_00]: overdoses every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of the rules that we've
implemented here that make a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The security requirements are the reason
Colorado doesn't have endless dispensary
[SPEAKER_00]: robberies, which is already looking like
it might be a problem in a couple of other
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization states where the mandated
security requirements are both less
[SPEAKER_00]: stringent and less publicized.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the great things about Colorado is
we blew that shit up big time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, we're going to make these
dispensaries, put everything on the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest video you can buy, the clearest
picture you can buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was on every news channel for months.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot be in our grow or dispensary
without being on camera from probably
[SPEAKER_01]: three different angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can count the blackheads on your nose
when you're in the parking lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can see this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cameras are so good at the grow at
Three Rivers that you can see the VIN
[SPEAKER_01]: number on my vehicle parked in the parking
lot in the building next door because the
[SPEAKER_01]: parking lot was too full because there
were trimmers there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just park in the building next door
and you can zoom in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of rules that we put in
place that have made our move from
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition into legalization a lot
smoother than it might've been otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And according to some research I was
looking at a couple of weeks ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot more successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They looked at how many or what percentage
of marijuana consumers period are buying
[SPEAKER_00]: their weed in the legal market versus the
illegal market or the gray market.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado has the biggest percentage of
consumers buying product in the legal
[SPEAKER_00]: market of any of the legalization states
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because of the model we built.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most user friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the least restrictive on the user
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's the most popular and the most
successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you talked about things we did add.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did we skip?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first thing we have to say is
consumption places.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nowhere in our rules in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nowhere that we are actually
allowed to safely, legally congregate and
[SPEAKER_01]: consume cannabis as adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Netherlands solved this 35 years ago
with cafes.
[SPEAKER_01]: In most places in America, I shouldn't
even go on this rant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go to just about any corner and
there is a bar and you can congregate with
[SPEAKER_01]: your adult friends and you can drink
alcohol until you throw up on yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most places in America, it doesn't matter
what your thing is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can congregate somewhere with other
people who are really into whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's beanie, baby, babies or guns
or cars or drag racing.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are still playing Pokemon Go,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went somewhere the other day and they're
walking around playing Pokemon Go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost ran some kid over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a picture of something up in
Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were like 30 people hanging out
playing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can gather and do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there are sex clubs, there are bars,
there are Elks lodges.
[SPEAKER_00]: People gather and play Magic the
Gathering.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we don't have a place where two
people can get together, order a
[SPEAKER_00]: cheeseburger or milkshake, take a couple
of dabs, have a conversation and grab an
[SPEAKER_00]: Uber home is just nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sure as fuck ain't scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if we can have shooting ranges and
bars, like we can figure out weed clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We definitely need that in the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other components, the public education
component on some of the products we
[SPEAKER_00]: offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I've explained the edibles thing
to other people, like my mom, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: because a lot of people, right when
legalization happened, came to Colorado to
[SPEAKER_00]: check it out, bought the candy bar because
they thought it was cute, went back to
[SPEAKER_00]: their hotel room, ate the whole candy bar
and lost their shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about Maureen Dowd's famous
edible nightmare on the show before.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several other fairly famous
incidents where a big name reporter or a
[SPEAKER_00]: celebrity came here, Ralph May,
and had some trouble with edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we could solve that all on the front
end with just a simple education campaign
[SPEAKER_00]: and better packaging and labeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: The packaging and labeling thing we
already did.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's still people out there in the
world that don't read labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: They buy a candy bar, they shove the whole
thing down their throat and wonder why
[SPEAKER_00]: they got way too highly afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the same thing with teenagers and
booze.
[SPEAKER_00]: They consume way too much the first couple
of times out of the gate, not
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding what they're dealing with
and consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they end up sick over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not that interesting or nuanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that's what happens when you
don't read the label and dive in head
[SPEAKER_00]: first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could prevent a lot of that with
just upfront education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado's got a program called the Good
to Know campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it's kind of cheesy, but a lot of
it's a lot of the messages they make are
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned shit from that thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, oh, I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a cool little thing I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first campaign Colorado funded was
just so stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was called Don't Be a Lab Rat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was laughed at by everybody on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We spent a fortune to put giant lab rat
cages around Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within an hour of them starting to
drop off the cages, it became the thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: do to smoke weed in the cage and take a
picture for social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within a week, all the cages were taken
down and it's some scrap yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were back at the drawing board
and they decided to just say, fuck it and
[SPEAKER_00]: go with actual research, verifiable,
honest health information.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll hear on the radio warnings about
Colorado law and how to follow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll hear on the radio or you'll see on
a commercial, you'll see things like,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, did you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll show like a little car cruising
around with a couple of people in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look like it's an animation and it's
real soft colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, did you know that it's illegal to
have cannabis in a state park?
[SPEAKER_01]: And at first I was like, oh yeah,
I forgot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even think of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that commercial tells everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, did you also know that
you can't fly out of here with your
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Please leave your stuff in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just like simple shit that like,
maybe it's kind of common sense for most
[SPEAKER_01]: people, but if maybe you didn't think
about it that way, like some people don't
[SPEAKER_01]: even realize that this is something that
you could buy here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you leave with it, you're fucked if
you get caught right outside of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can fuck your life up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wyoming, the state of Wyoming just
released a thing saying, hey, there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people coming here for the eclipse
that's come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of you are set and planning to come
through Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please leave your weed on the Colorado
side of the border.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, you hypocritical fucks,
like leave your fireworks on your side of
[SPEAKER_00]: the border then.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of stuff where you can
have it here and you can't have it there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but no one cares if you cross the line and
buy it and take some home for personal
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the case with marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: They care very much on the other side of
the border.
[SPEAKER_01]: We bought way too many fireworks one year
in Wyoming.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got pulled over and they took those
motherfuckers from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, there weren't parents groups
like warning about the date.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just so silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people in Nebraska really give a shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were like six boys that drove to
Wyoming in a van to go spend all of our
[SPEAKER_01]: summer savings on fucking fireworks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just like, let's get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where most of Pueblo's tax returns
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move forward after that comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our listener, Canuck, our Canuck friend
says, I hope I'm saying that right too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canuck, Canuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not met in a derogatory fashion,
I promise.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I know what it means.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just, I've never said the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are have enough common sense
not to make it this far south.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, hopefully we can skip a few of
the steps and end up with some smart rules
[SPEAKER_01]: for the legal growing distribution and use
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to your podcast and Mike's clear
explanations, we will be better equipped
[SPEAKER_01]: to step up and be heard if things start
heading in the wrong direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ready to step up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good work, Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've taught the people well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely be ready to step up because
it's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing I did not expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have in retrospect, but I did not
expect anti-pop people just flying out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the woodwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's quite a few of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of people without a lot to
do in the evenings.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way to put it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, seriously, you read the
interviews with these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there was one in, I don't even
remember the magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a major East coast magazine,
something out of Boston.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to feel dumb if it was the
Boston Globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might've been the Boston Globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where she's describing how she got into
leading an anti-pod group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's like, we were driving home one
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my kid was like, what's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't know how to tell them about
the new weed store in town.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, what'd you say when he
pointed at the gun store, the liquor
[SPEAKER_00]: store, the titty bar, the homeless person
urinating on the street sign, the lady
[SPEAKER_00]: hooking on Lake, like seriously,
like you're a parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if, if you can't figure out how to be
like, well, son, some people like to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to consume marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a thing that adults do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't really know about till it's
older.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see that little green cross thing,
just ignore it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have nothing you need or want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's three X's in the blinky lady mean
mommy?
[SPEAKER_00]: It means there's a sad man who doesn't
have people to talk to when he gets home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where he spends all his $1
bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it ain't that fucking hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be a parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But instead of doing that, she decided
that she was going to get together with
[SPEAKER_00]: her church friends and try to chase the
pots for out of town.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because that's easier than honestly
educating your child.
[SPEAKER_00]: To survive a dangerous world, social
justice warriors were way better than
[SPEAKER_01]: parents now.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, and as far as I'm concerned,
it's like, instead of teaching them how to
[SPEAKER_00]: cross, look both ways before they cross
the street, you tried to get all cars
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, it would make crossing the
street safer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I got a fucking walk everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the FedEx guys got to carry all that
shit in a backpack.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna push your kid down every time I
walk by him too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's just, it's not practical for the
world we live in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's part of the reason trolling
them is so easy on my Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the email keeps going.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, uh, where did I leave off?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah, sorry for the long email,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be, this is a beautiful email.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the start of the email,
I remember you said that you wanted some
[SPEAKER_01]: advice on stealth growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wrote down stealth episodes so that
I could do more talk about a stealth
[SPEAKER_01]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of stuff that's for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a couple of good videos out
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was just a lot of stuff in this
email that I wanted to get through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it took us 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't even do the stealth part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad that I got all the way through
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He also says, I wanted you to know the
respect and thanks I send your way for you
[SPEAKER_01]: and your guests is from the heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he says, gratefully cabinet
growing Canuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, uh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I read a lot of emails and I get a
lot of praise on the internet and all that
[SPEAKER_01]: good stuff, but man, all of it matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I appreciate all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you, you're a thinker, you're a smart
person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love it when smart people are
learning from me and we're lifting
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody up together.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for doing what you do in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the time comes, if you do need to
step up and speak out and have your voice
[SPEAKER_01]: heard, please do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your voice may shake a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know who you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may jump up and fucking talk like
fucking a celebrity getting an Oscar
[SPEAKER_01]: speech and just crush it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you may be a nervous person.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may get a little shaky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your feet may get sweaty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your palms may get sweaty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your mouth may get all dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just say what you have to say and just say
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so glad it's hard to find video.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not impossible because the places
where you tend to end up speaking about
[SPEAKER_00]: these things tend to have audio and video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Video recording, but I'm glad it's hard to
find the video of the first 30 times I
[SPEAKER_00]: spoke in public at city council stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate public speaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still terrifies me.
[SPEAKER_00]: My heart reacts like I'm going into a
fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I go up and sit down at the
microphone, I know what I want to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how I want to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a thing in, in boxing that
they say like everybody has a plan until
[SPEAKER_00]: they get hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they say it in a lot of movies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me is public speaking wise,
that's true until I get down to the
[SPEAKER_00]: microphone and I go, good evening,
the city council, the county commissioners
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I'm done saying the name of
whoever I'm addressing, I have no more
[SPEAKER_00]: plan anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's game on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to stick to the strategy and the
layout and the talking points I came in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at one point I literally said,
I was pointing out how much money would
[SPEAKER_00]: the city was missing by not allowing
marijuana stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I listed the total that the county had
done in sales and it was some nutty number
[SPEAKER_00]: for Pueblo, like 1.8 or 1.7 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's woohooed like right into the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking outgored it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And afterwards, the guy that does the
recording for the city council came
[SPEAKER_00]: running up and gave me a big bear hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, that was the coolest
thing that's ever happened in this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, no, that was the dumbest
thing that's ever happened in this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But shit like that happens just because
it's terrifying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people have weird reactions to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but don't be afraid of that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone who's, who's ever spoken in
public understands what you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this guy could be a lawyer,
you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: So he could be used to this, but still,
if you're not just sometimes get up and
[SPEAKER_00]: rock the mic, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not comfortable being the
face, there's a lot of ways to support
[SPEAKER_00]: smart policy or support legalization
anonymously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, um, Facebook makes it real easy,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know how, shoot me a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope, um, Pueblo for sensible cannabis
laws on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, uh, I mean, dozens and dozens and
dozens of ways for you to fight for,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, what you want to fight for without
opening yourself up to a lot of blowback
[SPEAKER_00]: or consequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm happy to help, uh, anyone do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone, not just, uh, not just our Canuck
friend, anybody that wants to stand up for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and move it forward with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Mike, we've been going for an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to wrap up the show and take a
couple of dads and call it a day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, uh, we haven't podcasted in a minute,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, honestly, good emails like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like we weren't at work today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, let's do another email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to go back tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got to wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's getting late.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, those are great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, cabinet growing Canuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I've got a stack of emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike sees this folder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at all these papers, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are all fresh emails that we got to
get through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might take us a minute to do a good
stealth growing episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the meantime, um, some time on Google
and YouTube, you might be able to find a
[SPEAKER_00]: good couple of videos produced by high
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll come up with some good short ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of good stuff that you can
go where people have already had this
[SPEAKER_00]: question because it was prohibited for so
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a lot of that stuff got published,
but, uh, that sounds like a fun show to
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll definitely knock that one out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't be too hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some tricks, uh, carbon filters.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your main thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Extra carbon filters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Walk around your place at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if you can smell anything,
hear anything, listen, listen a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look for light leaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do a whole episode on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's not burn it out now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, make sure you follow Mike on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Pueblo for sensible cannabis
laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also follow him on Twitter and Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Nemo punk 15.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find me on Facebook search for the
grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find me on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at G F Y H podcast on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, I've got like 15.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I got pretty close to 15,000
followers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I posted a photo the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got over 2000 likes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm at 2,200 and something likes by now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you follow me and check out my
photography on Instagram, it's I re I R I
[SPEAKER_01]: E underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read genetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I re underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of photography.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what I'm up to.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what I'm growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what I'm breathing.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what I got going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't post any pictures of myself or
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are probably pictures of myself on
there, but it's all just weed plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis photography, gorgeous
photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're, if you're into the cannabis
plant and find a lot of beauty there,
[SPEAKER_00]: his Instagram feeds pretty phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a, there's some purple plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some green plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some friends there not too long
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was asking me if I had photos from the
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, Oh, just go check out my
buddy's Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a way better photographer than I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm busy right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have time for the photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 15 minutes later, I get a text.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I had no idea it came in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just green all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it came in green and brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, where was I also, ladies and
gentlemen, I appreciate great emails.
