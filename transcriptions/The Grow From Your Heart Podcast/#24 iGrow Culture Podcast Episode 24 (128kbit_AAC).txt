versus clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we also talked a little bit about
feminized seeds and autoflower seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: None of us really seemed to like
autoflower seeds, but we did talk about
[SPEAKER_05]: one very useful application.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll go ahead and get right to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did get a little dabbed out.

[SPEAKER_05]: So without any further ado, let's go get
to the conversation with Jesse,
[SPEAKER_05]: Spence and myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_05]: We are back.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got my homie, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_05]: At Jesse Grose on Instagram and Twitter.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also we got, is it at Jesse Grose on
Twitter?
[SPEAKER_05]: I looked for you, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's another person called Jesse Grose
on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck that guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: How the hell is that even?
[SPEAKER_05]: Politely fuck that guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, actually I don't know him.
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be cool as shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be like your German clone or
something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Be just like you in Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Jesse Grose.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also with us over here on the microphone
is our buddy Spence.
[SPEAKER_05]: What up, Spence?
[SPEAKER_05]: What up, guys?
[SPEAKER_05]: Spence has got his microphone
strategically placed so that he can iPhone
[SPEAKER_05]: it up on the table.
[SPEAKER_05]: And talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: And talk at the same time.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got the elbows out.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's chilling it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have had some fat dabs today.
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you give me a dab of a minute
ago?
[SPEAKER_05]: That live resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a Yeti OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I loved it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been smoking on that Yeti OG around
here for a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big ups to the people making the live
resin happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a whole chain of people that make
that happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not one or two people.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a big fucking chain of command.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I appreciate that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very much so.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you guys doing today, man?
[SPEAKER_02]: Chilling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excited to be here for another podcast,
you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: You told me what you did today.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: We won't talk about that on the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's hilarious shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man is getting his hustle on in ways you
never thought of.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesse dug fucking fence post holes all
day.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's lively.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's over here hyper.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: He just took a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we all took fat dabs over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe all of us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesse did just take.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the largest dab I've ever seen
Jesse voluntarily take on his own.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen people give him a dab that big.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've never seen him dip in for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been practicing the last few weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the music up for you guys?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Turned it down way solo.
[SPEAKER_05]: We couldn't hear it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we're here together and talk about
the subject at hand, which today I decided
[SPEAKER_05]: we want to talk about clones versus seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe we'll do a little bit of talking
about feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we might talk a little bit briefly,
briefly about auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got one thing I wanted to mention in
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: This mix that I'm playing really has a lot
of volume jumps in the background.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I apologize that it's so jumpy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're listening to DJ Nickatee in the
background again.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to give him a shout out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out, DJ Nickatee.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for letting me play your music.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: So everybody at this table is a pretty
damn experienced grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got I'd call myself a breeder.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesse's a Paul and Chuck or maybe a
breeder.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if he'd call himself a
breeder yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: More practice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Spence is a hell of a grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had some stuff tested and Spence is
tested higher than all of my stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he grew somebody else's strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember what the numbers were,
bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: Capelton was 20 percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a Girl Scout Cookie Cross,
which was creepy OG in Girl Scout.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was 25, maybe 24, probably 24.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ryan's Rhino, 100 percent Sativa,
25 percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Forum Girl Scout Cookies tested
that right around 27.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this guy crushed it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had some great, great tests.
[SPEAKER_05]: My Veganic Lemon Jeffrey tested right
around 24 percent, if that gives you some.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, by the way, that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the best veganic weed I've
probably ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: How much veganic weed have you smoked?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've smoked some.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've smoked some from there's a place in
the Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's the Natural Mystics.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really the only really place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I tried some of Buds and Roses at
the Cups and that was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kyle Cushman's Veganics.
[SPEAKER_05]: So mine stood up to Kyle Cushman's.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a hell of a compliment right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely a, you have a thing for
Sativas and not a lot of people like
[SPEAKER_02]: Sativas, but I like the, you know,
the citrusy, you know, really high highs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Letting a plant take more time to grow
like a Sativa does to let you get more out
[SPEAKER_02]: of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nothing but the longer, the better,
in my opinion, for sure, depending on your
[SPEAKER_02]: technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Guys quit cutting your plants down too
early.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I was just and Jesse to give him
some credit in the game.
[SPEAKER_05]: He won the Pueblo Super Bud Bowl and they
gave him hell of a huge compliment.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you guys listened to past episodes,
we talked about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: The judges of the Super Bud Bowl said that
Jesse's strains stood out in flavor,
[SPEAKER_05]: aroma, taste and effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Overall, without a doubt, he was the hands
down winner, the freaking champ,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Grape OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: Grape OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hell of a strain too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I took some cuts of it today.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these guys are, we're all experienced
growers here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm of course the breeder from
iRegenetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to talk a little bit about
clones and seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you guys, do you have a preference,
Jesse, from going from growing from clone
[SPEAKER_05]: or seed?
[SPEAKER_01]: It has more to do with the end mission,
I guess, of, you know, whatever particular
[SPEAKER_01]: round, but I'd grow from seed if that was,
you know, all I could do from now on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're going to set up, I guess a
better question would be if you're going
[SPEAKER_05]: to set up a giant warehouse, not a giant,
what if I give you 20 lights and I was 20
[SPEAKER_05]: flowering lights and it's all yours,
you're going to start brand new,
[SPEAKER_05]: would you grow from clones or seeds at
that point?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd probably go with clones.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: How about you, Spence, if you had 20
lights to play with?
[SPEAKER_02]: If I had it to play with, I'd probably
take like two lights and maybe do some
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds, but there's just, you know,
when you're that scale, you want something
[SPEAKER_02]: that's proven to give you what you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a perfect segue into what I was
going to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Clones, the pros of clones are that you
know you've got females.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those have been ran and tested.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you've got a clone, I'll talk a
little bit about a clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: And give us some setup for what they are
because people are new listeners.
[SPEAKER_05]: A clone is a cutting taken from a plant,
a mother plant that you hopefully have ran
[SPEAKER_05]: before and flowered out and you know that
that's some good shit or someone else or
[SPEAKER_05]: someone else has one of your trusted bros
like Spence or Jesse at the table.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they give me a clone, I definitely
appreciate it and trust it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't usually get dispensary clones and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're mediocre most of the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you got to know who you're getting it
from, but usually it's a reliable crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a female.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody in the crew has grown it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can say, that takes eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: That takes nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: That takes 10 weeks or be careful because
that fucker might herm if you over
[SPEAKER_05]: nitrogen it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there there's things we know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's one of the super super pros of a
clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: A clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know the growth patterns.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know if we need to top it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, we know if we need to train it a
little bit, we know how tall it's going to
[SPEAKER_05]: get.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that the sour diesel cut I've got,
if you let it grow more than two feet tall
[SPEAKER_05]: and veg, it's going to be eight feet tall
and flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that from, we've grown it
several times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I grew that one time and I
learned.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you learned quick on that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tickling your lights.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, and then you know, to feed it also,
uh, because you know how long it's going
[SPEAKER_05]: to take, you know, when to begin flushing,
you know, when it's going to be done.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cons of clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why I was asking about the giant
warehouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, clones are where you get most of your
damn bugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think when some, one of your buddies
tries to give you a sweet cut,
[SPEAKER_05]: a sour diesel and you get it to your
garden and you're irresponsible and it's
[SPEAKER_05]: partly your responsibility to quarantine
that thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, uh, sometimes you fail yourself just
like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you end up with, uh, spider mites,
the, the feared hemp russet might in your
[SPEAKER_05]: weed garden right now, those things will
take down your entire crop in two days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a friend tell me he had those.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, you want to see them?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even want to see you anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you ever get those, just start over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fire is the cure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually, uh, I have something I'm
experimenting with a product.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I've mentioned it on the
show because I don't want to say anything
[SPEAKER_05]: until I'm familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, it seems to kill everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, if you do it wrong,
it will kill everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I, I've volunteered a few plants and I did
a few different applications in a couple
[SPEAKER_05]: of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just fucking cooked them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if I learn to do it right,
I feel like it'll work well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to learn it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to make you hard to hear.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesse's afraid of the microphone.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We could hear you all day just like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep worrying about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys are wondering what that furry
sound is, it's music in the background.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not Jesse's beard rubbing on the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we get our bugs, our problems,
our diseases, our pathogens.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, powdery mildew comes from clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, seeds do not carry bugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: They do not carry diseases.
[SPEAKER_05]: They do not carry pathogens.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, something about a clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: If, uh, if I grow a pack of seeds and I
pick the keeper out of that, so you grow
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 seeds, there'd be different phenotypes
in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully, uh, you find that one that's
stellar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe my opinion of that stellar plant is
way different than Spence's opinion or way
[SPEAKER_05]: different than Jesse's opinion or the
other guy growing or so you, I like the
[SPEAKER_05]: ability to pick my own, which is a benefit
of the seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a con of the clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe my grow style or what I'm
looking for is way different than what you
[SPEAKER_05]: guys are looking for.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you get a 10 pack of seeds,
how many keepers do you hope to find out
[SPEAKER_05]: of those?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you hope for that just one or are you
looking for all 10 of them?
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually, um, I just look for differences
throughout because some of them,
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on what you're, you know,
what kind of seeds you're popping,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll find differences and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I usually try to keep three just so I
have a, you know, if I have three plants
[SPEAKER_02]: that don't all look the same, maybe,
you know, I just want a better chance of
[SPEAKER_02]: finding something that's not as,
or that's better than one or the other.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good that you say three in my
opinion, because usually I find the one
[SPEAKER_05]: that looks like, if you're crossing a male
and a female plant, I like to find the
[SPEAKER_05]: male, like the one that looks like the
male, the one that looks like the female.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that one that's a hybrid of the
two.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's usually a good, good way to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, uh, smoke all those,
get them tested, do what you can,
[SPEAKER_05]: have the crew smoke them, make shatter out
of them, make live resin out of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: See what happens to all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cure them a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cure them a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something I failed at when I was a
new grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would take that stuff and as soon as it
was dry enough to start smoking,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd start smoking it up, see which was my
favorite.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure I got rid of a few keepers.
[SPEAKER_05]: That I just didn't even know yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess that leads us into seeds a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you buy a 10 pack of seeds,
I really like that variation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you buy a 10 pack, you pop them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes there's fucking seven males in
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that, that's nature.
[SPEAKER_05]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a numbers game.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like bingo.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is like bingo.
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully you get that one good one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully you get some five,
five males, five females is usually what I
[SPEAKER_05]: hope for somewhere in that area.
[SPEAKER_05]: You hope to get one that you can spot
right away that you're like, eh,
[SPEAKER_05]: we got to call that bitch.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you got those four to work with.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like Spence said, you get three.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's where you find new stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of the pros of growing from
seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: You find all that new stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's something I thought about
earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything we're growing came from seed in
the first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually down the road, the way it's
supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we couldn't have a plant without the
seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody took a clone of OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If everyone, you know, keeps growing from
clone, there are very bad consequences to
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What could happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Big major companies could maintain control
of the seed stock similar to some
[SPEAKER_01]: ornamental flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that I can't quote species of or
anything like that, but I know it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: hard to find like genuine seed of some
flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of the vegetables, you can only
find specific seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_05]: See, so we, it's, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: More beneficial to grow from seed or a
benefit of growing from seed or they'll
[SPEAKER_01]: just start selling only family seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, there won't be a gene pool.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's something as a breeder.
[SPEAKER_05]: I try to pay attention to, I try to make,
and you guys have probably noticed I've
[SPEAKER_05]: been pulling out a lot more reg seeds
lately.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got to have reg seeds because you got
to have the males to keep the breeding
[SPEAKER_05]: alive or it's going to get stale.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, F1 hybrids are where it's at.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey guys, if you're breeding, please throw
away the bullshit.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be some stuff that comes
out of your breeding projects that is not
[SPEAKER_05]: worth re-breeding or giving out those
seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just toss those.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause you're polluting the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're making it weak.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, you're making a bunch of runs and
mutants and you're fucking it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just get rid of all that non-elite star,
non-elite stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the poser stuff and just kill it,
dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just kill it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can breed more seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's more coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely give props to the people who
actually try their own seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you, if you produce some seeds,
actually grow it, see what it is before
[SPEAKER_02]: you give it to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give a bunch of it away also.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, give them away so that other people
can, so you can see what Nancy Budwell,
[SPEAKER_05]: shout out to Nancy Budwell, what she does.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, that lady grows some fun cannabis
under, under LEDs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not even a big fan of LEDs and she is
killing it with that shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I'm actually, I like that you say
that you keep saying good shit to make
[SPEAKER_05]: more good shit to talk about.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm growing the night nurse right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, she looks stellar.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one that looks really grateful dog
dominant, but smells like Tora Bora.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it'll pass those CBDs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need some good CBD medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: So with the, with the seeds, you get new
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we were talking about, uh,
you get to do that phenotype hunt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, that's, uh, that's essentially when
you pop a pack of seeds, they call it
[SPEAKER_05]: mapping or searching or hunting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Subcool calls it something different.
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot what he even calls it,
but it's a phenohunt in this group is what
[SPEAKER_05]: we call it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, you run as many seeds as you can get
of one strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can do 20 of them, do 20,
that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: 25 of something is cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, if you've only got a 10 or a six pack
or a five pack that works to just work on
[SPEAKER_05]: your scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the more, the better because that
gives you, you can see what that strains
[SPEAKER_05]: potential is and you know what you're
looking for a little better and you can
[SPEAKER_05]: get that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I know what I want out of a grateful
dog pack of beans.
[SPEAKER_05]: You may want something totally different
out of a pack of dog beans.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, and we'll find it by doing that
phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's fun to me running that hunt,
seeing the variations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as a breeder, I love seeing the
variations from my creations.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, if we're growing clones, we're all
growing the same shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, there's a blue dream cut going around
this town right now, going around
[SPEAKER_05]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's just this town.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it is just Colorado in general
that like every time I see somebody post a
[SPEAKER_02]: picture of blue dream is like,
dear God, there it is again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Harvest heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll grow in any type of conditions and
she'll, she'll give you some product back
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're good to her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can pull a six ounces out of a seven
gallon pot with four of them per light.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a pound and a half of herb.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, let her go about 70 days.
[SPEAKER_05]: She packs it on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that Andy's blue dream cut?
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Andy.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up ABD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come get your stuff back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love it so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so good that it's just terrible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, no, we love the Andy's blue dream.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't mean to call it terrible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, how about the, uh, the cons of growing
from seed?
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people are not good at spotting
males.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the main problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I would, I mean, if you're a beginner
grower, you know, sometimes you don't even
[SPEAKER_02]: know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I know people that have seen male
plants and like, is there ever going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers from there?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, no, these are two
completely different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I just think it's about paying
attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you pay attention, there's,
there's, you've gotta see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Read a book, read a book.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every grow book has a picture of a male
and a female right next to each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, spot your males.
[SPEAKER_05]: What about mutants?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes you get that crazy mutant shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're funky.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Ken dog is a mutant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The person or the both.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Kim dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're writing Kim dog,
it's C H E M D O G.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: D O G.
[SPEAKER_05]: He corrected us.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's D O G.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out Kim dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to have a dog named that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, D O G.
[SPEAKER_05]: D O G.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, my buddy Ryan had a dog named D O G
and he was a cool ass dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I miss you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't seen you guys in a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't listen to the show, but still
thinking about you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, selection time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, when you're growing from seeds,
there is always that phenol hunt.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're growing from clones,
that first crop you're going to grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's blue dream.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got all the blue dream you can handle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, when you're running from seed,
you got to run a crop to find what you're
[SPEAKER_05]: even messing with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then run a crop to keep again of the
ones you like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you need to eliminate more,
then you're going to run it again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again and again and narrow it down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, and then hopefully you take
clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, on another episode,
take clones of everything you ever grow
[SPEAKER_02]: before it's in flower, right before you
fly like 15 days before you put it in
[SPEAKER_05]: flower, take some clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: That way, you know, those clones are going
to root.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you don't have clones, you can try
again, like give yourself a chance,
[SPEAKER_05]: plan ahead, plan ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're growing, it's always,
uh, it's always beneficial.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, give yourself the advantage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The advantage, the heads up for yourself
is like, don't put yourself behind.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause once you're behind and growing,
you're behind and growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that probably means your plants are
stressed out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're stressed, they are.
[SPEAKER_05]: You ain't lying.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, the cons of seeds, uh,
if you need, uh, you got to learn each
[SPEAKER_05]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when you find those phenotypes,
you got to learn them and you got to learn
[SPEAKER_05]: them.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like having three different
girlfriends.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you found three keepers, one's going to
like a lot of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: One's going to get mad at too much
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: One's going to be really picky.
[SPEAKER_05]: One's going to be really easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: One's going to bud out.
[SPEAKER_05]: One's going to taste real good.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to have to learn each
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_05]: One may go a little longer.
[SPEAKER_05]: One may come down a little sooner.
[SPEAKER_05]: One may need to be topped.
[SPEAKER_05]: One may climb up into the fucking lights
real high.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to learn all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, the con of course that comes with that
is wasted space.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're a cashcropper, the,
the seeds that kind of messes you up.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what about fem seeds?
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen, I mean, I've grown fem seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: They take away the worry about having a
male.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are still chances where you'll get
some funky stuff, but you just got to
[SPEAKER_02]: still pay attention.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've made some funky stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've grown some funky stuff for me that,
uh, I'm not even going to say the strain
[SPEAKER_05]: to discourage anybody, but it's still good
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because I'm seeing excellent
phenotypes coming out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got some downstairs that looks
gnarly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Spence grew one that shot out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was shot out a stick with a gigantic
leaf, the size of bigger than my hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then another stick and then like
normal size leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I don't even remember what went
on because I just looked away.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, uh, it was like seeing a car
wreck.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can look for a minute, but then you're
like, yeah, it had a reattach amputee arm,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I like, sometimes I like things like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if it's going to be a female,
I'm the type of girl where I'll give it a
[SPEAKER_02]: chance.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it doesn't, if it doesn't work,
it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always more seeds to plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are always more seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't be afraid to call something and
like, if you guys have something that is a
[SPEAKER_05]: level eight, let's work fun getting you
guys a level 10.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get you some good seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Survival of the fittest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Survival of the fittest.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know seeds are expensive and we just
talk like you could just pop more,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's well worth it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're growing herb, you should be
doing all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You should at least be able to afford a
pack of seeds after the harvest.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mentioned fem seeds, fem seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, just a quick little, uh, that's red
rat in the background there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That got my attention.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to show the music.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to dance around like Wookiees
for a second.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll remember where we were.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take a dab with us guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got some really cool ass people in the
room today.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really honored to have these guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is guests.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some acid in the car.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just said dance around like Wookiees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a really a random statement to
say on a recording.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really high.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he didn't mean that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a joke.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually, there's a battery acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Torch out of your way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a joke guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which rig you going for?
[SPEAKER_05]: Spence do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can hit the hitman with the highly
educated titanium domeless nail.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some stuff in the works with
highly educated right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's that classic Reggae air horn.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotta love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we were doing a podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now suddenly we're taking a break and
dabbing guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you like the way potheads work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you're taking a dab while I am too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd only be right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Grab that beer rig.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jess take a dab with us.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have a three rig session.
[SPEAKER_05]: There aren't three torches, but we'll make
it happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, that's some turpex.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want that.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some live over there and we're
spoiled here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we were in Texas, this table would
equal life in prison and you're black.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's two lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you won't catch me there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best thing about Texas is seeing the
state line in your rear view.
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have a reason to go to Texas or a
reason to hate on Texas really,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I don't have a reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bomb food and people down there
know how to party.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got some good friends that are from
Texas and they're actually all good
[SPEAKER_05]: people.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just lost my headphones.
[SPEAKER_05]: They die out.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll tap on the thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll work again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Headphones working, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't, if you guys are buying gear for a
podcast, never buy a live wire solutions,
[SPEAKER_05]: headphone, four channel stereo,
headphone, amplifiers, piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the third one I've gotten dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know you're like, why'd you get a
third one?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause if you go to guitar center with it
and you yell at them, they keep just
[SPEAKER_05]: giving you a fresh one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just keep reusing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So three people just smoked a gram of hash
and like three dads, one dad each.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some on my phone on my tape later.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your phone is probably the only thing
without had a hash on it up until now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty much my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything is all sticky.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to call the recording studio,
the sticky knob studios.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds a little bit funky.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought people might take that wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, that part of the show was brought to
you by oil slick, oil slick tools to help
[SPEAKER_05]: you concentrate.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just set my stuff down on this fancy oil
slick pad here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to get any sticky rings on
my table.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really nice oil slick pad there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, don't you, uh, don't you work at a
hydro shop?
[SPEAKER_05]: What were they called again?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, high grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're called high grow Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Check out high grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're awesome over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Jesse does a lot of lifting and
moving.
[SPEAKER_05]: So all the organization and stuff,
uh, give shout outs to Jesse.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're working in the fucking hot Colorado
heat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, it's August 9th.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to give a quick shout out to Jerry
Garcia.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Much love, much respect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jerry Garcia.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Jerry changed my life, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I never got to see Jerry live,
but the music of the grateful dead and the
[SPEAKER_05]: culture of the grateful dead are
definitely in my heart.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is big part of my world.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll get back to the point here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Podcast time, feminized seeds,
always females.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the time, uh, I'll say 99% of the
time females.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesse told us a story before about a
dispensary owner running 200 and something
[SPEAKER_05]: feminized seeds and having four males.
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect math fucked up everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you get a bunch of seeds?
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, what was that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I just saw your brain go blank.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when you're at a house and your
fucking balance clicks in and the lights
[SPEAKER_05]: go dim real quick, you just went blink and
you came back right fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like where were we?
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, did you get a bunch of seeds from that
run where the owner fucked it all up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they had a bunch of seeds.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, they tried to sell them too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's a dispensary for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had no idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the problem with femme seeds,
me being a feminized seed maker,
[SPEAKER_05]: I know this is the big problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't know you've got a problem until
like week seven or week eight when you've
[SPEAKER_05]: already invested a lot of time into that
plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're running femme seeds,
my advice, and this is what I do,
[SPEAKER_05]: I flower them little.
[SPEAKER_05]: I run them in a three gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I veg them for very minimal time until I
can take three cuts off of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And once they're all big enough for three
cuts, I flower them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Out the first time to find out what I've
got.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you can find out if you've got
trouble or if you've got gold.
[SPEAKER_05]: So go early with the femmes, if you can,
just to find out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would do that with any plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had some, uh, some fire seeds from
femme.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an odd noise.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't hear that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That could be Spencer's phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody was growing hops.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit was tight on your phone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Growing hops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like weed there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's related to weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the cousin.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like a black cousin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like, the black cousin of
finding clamp.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my nigga hops.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hops.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could say that spin said I could say
that I can say that it's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe I just said that on the
podcast though.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_05]: He made me, he makes me say shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave him his pass a year and a half ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys brought up beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, uh, whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hear now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I can kind of hear now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can really hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I have a beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're making friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and we had a serious conversation last
night about making a marijuana beer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would, I don't drink, but I would try
one of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to say I drank a marijuana beer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Spence and I might split it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get, I get a little turn off one beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking about like a really small
recipe.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and then you could ferment that beer
in your grow room and use your weed beer
[SPEAKER_05]: CO2 to enhance your ganja plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would that be a little sacrilegious
cannibalistic almost?
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's your fermenting brothers.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want it to be, if you want it to
be.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to beer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I miss you beer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't had a beer in a long,
long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm better off without it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I haven't had a beer since I got
my very first medical marijuana card.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's when I was like, you know,
I don't need to drink.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got the car smoke all the herb I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice trade off with myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad kind of sorted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He still drinks occasionally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Mr. Witt.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're, uh, if you're listening to the
show, man, what's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's me.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up pops.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a cool ass dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool ass dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, we're kind of ranting about fem
seeds a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, fem seeds I've noticed and you might,
you guys, I don't know if you've paid
[SPEAKER_05]: enough attention, uh, cause I'm looking
more, I'm the breeder.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, fem seeds are always a closer
representation of the parents I have
[SPEAKER_05]: found.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't get as much, like when we run
gauges F ones, there's not, there's not as
[SPEAKER_02]: much variation as what you're saying.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, fem seeds are more uniform.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're closer.
[SPEAKER_05]: They look a lot alike.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we run gauges F ones, we never know
what we're going to get a 10 pack varies
[SPEAKER_05]: so much unless it was as per rare.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those were awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you suppose that's because they are
supposedly missing the male chromosomes?
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, that, and you're not introducing,
it feels like, uh, when you're bringing
[SPEAKER_05]: out the F ones, I feel like you're getting
a lot of recessive traits and you're just
[SPEAKER_05]: not bringing, it could be because of the
male chromosomes are missing, but it feels
[SPEAKER_05]: like you're not going back as far in the
lineage.
[SPEAKER_05]: They forgot who their grandparents were.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somehow just by selfing them.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's what it feels like.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm also doing a lot of selfing of one
plant, uh, and using it to pollinate the
[SPEAKER_05]: same strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are starting to come out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm on the, it would kind of, it's inbred,
but it's kind of an F three is what level
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm at.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're the grateful dog S three.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are almost all looking the same by
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a, that's a dang strain by the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the one that put me on the map.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to the Cali connection and
swerve because, uh, just shout out to
[SPEAKER_05]: those guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: They did me a favor.
[SPEAKER_05]: So shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to actually bring up in this
conversation that, uh, there's so many S
[SPEAKER_01]: ones and F ones out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, we were talking about
say, uh, protecting the lineage and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't really do that with F ones,
S ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, you got to have three.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, DJ short says F two is crucial.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where a lot of stuff is really
where you got to pay attention.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I've, I've fucked up the F twos.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been like, Oh no, I use the raw.
[SPEAKER_05]: I chose the wrong, the wrong F one to put
to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then was like, Nope, that's not,
I got to go find a different male out of
[SPEAKER_05]: this mix.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause this is not where we're a different
female and try this again.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just have to go back.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to keep seeds of each one and
label them what they were.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like this is the, I'll say golden goat
times daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the first run and make sure that
those are legit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then find a good, I want to find a
golden goat dominant one out of there and
[SPEAKER_05]: hit it again with the daybreaker male.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm hoping to make it look a lot like
daybreaker and smell like golden goat.
[SPEAKER_05]: The goats, the goat vigor.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if it doesn't, I could just have to
back up again and go find another female
[SPEAKER_05]: to use and just keep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Eventually I'll ditch a project.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I have to go back too many times twice,
if I don't get it this first or second
[SPEAKER_05]: time, I'm like, yeah, that obviously
doesn't want to do what I want it to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Out of so many seeds, you should get what
you want the first or second, first or
[SPEAKER_05]: second try.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, uh, the depot dog strain I had,
uh, or have, um, I had to do it three
[SPEAKER_01]: times before I was happy with it the first
time and then continued from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Due to like leaks and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And something in me says, if it doesn't
work the first time or the second time,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm probably not going to get what I want.
[SPEAKER_05]: I keep cutting the music out a little too
much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a random.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is kind of off topic, but on topic,
how do you guys feel?
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you seen where Arian goes to places
Arian from greenhouse seeds?
[SPEAKER_05]: They travel to places and get land race
genetics from I'll say Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they went to like, uh, uh,
they went to somewhere in India,
[SPEAKER_05]: Nepal, or somewhere like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't pay enough attention.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just have to watch things quickly while
I'm trimming.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, they go to these places and they
get their land raised seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so now Arian's got all land races from
everywhere, but in exchange he leaves them
[SPEAKER_05]: a handful of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reg seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Femseeds and regs.
[SPEAKER_05]: He'll give them a fems and regs,
but he gives them handfuls of seeds to
[SPEAKER_05]: grow and he tells them what they are.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now those land races are gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's just open pollination of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he just made off with the last of the
land race seeds, introducing hybrids and
[SPEAKER_01]: modern and developed world genetics into
fragile places that have land race
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics like that is a, um, that's kind
of a douchebag thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the nicest way I can say it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same thing as, uh, releasing
fucking, uh, animals that are not from
[SPEAKER_05]: that area.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or insects that are not from that area.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to wreak havoc on shit and
destroy the ecosystem that's already there
[SPEAKER_05]: and disrupt the balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or asking all the farmers to grow some GMO
corn.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's he's kind of doing the same thing
to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys think about that when you're,
uh, when you're doing what you're doing,
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of think about the effects that
you're having, like the ripples that you
[SPEAKER_05]: make in your life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause little stuff makes big, big ripples.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that saying about a butterfly in
the rainforest and a monsoon somewhere
[SPEAKER_01]: else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: If, uh, if a hippie scratches his nuts in
Pueblo, uh, there's a tidal wave in China
[SPEAKER_05]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something like that happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So all you hippies scratching your nuts,
be careful cause of tidal waves.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was a random, uh, rant on the pros
and cons of seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess the, it's still, uh,
I think they're equal in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's benefits of both.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a reason to run seeds and there's
a benefit to run clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, and as a seed breeder, uh,
I should probably big up the seeds a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit more, but to tell you the
truth, uh, all those famous cuts that
[SPEAKER_05]: you're getting, they're a famous cut for a
reason.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we all have everybody in this room
grows the cookies and everybody in this
[SPEAKER_05]: room has got a gorilla glue for a cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: So no, not yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you will by the end of the day then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could use another cut of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw, I saw your Instagram spins.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we all saw that beautiful gorilla
glue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who'd that come from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to give someone a shout out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, shout out to Mariano's clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's his Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, he's out of Cali, Southern Cali,
not Southern Cali, maybe like Central
[SPEAKER_02]: Cali.
[SPEAKER_02]: Central Cali.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, probably some of the best clones I've
ever received as far as a month in a,
[SPEAKER_02]: or I got, got them like a month in four
days ago or something and they have
[SPEAKER_02]: literally blown the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're healthy.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're happy at Garden of Weedon on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: Garden of Weed, capital N at the end of
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all detached to the Garden of Weedon.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's websites, Facebook, Tumblr.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, we did not talk about auto flower
plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one thing I wanted to mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just get whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of how I feel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, auto flower plants are, that's just,
I will never breed people.
[SPEAKER_05]: I always ask me if I will make an auto
flower as a breeder and I always say no,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's a, that's word.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not for big boys.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then some people are going to hate me
for saying that if you need a fast
[SPEAKER_05]: production crop and you're not familiar
with the cannabis plant, that may work for
[SPEAKER_05]: you, but it's not connoisseur grade herb
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesse and I are familiar with one epic
freaking use of auto flower plants to
[SPEAKER_05]: discredit all the shit I just talked.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we live in a community that is about
40 minutes away from a national forest.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, maybe an hour, depending on which
routes you take.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, there was a, um, a legendary fucking
bust of, there was a Mexican cartel in the
[SPEAKER_05]: national forest running a giant grow
operation all year long, uh, very covertly
[SPEAKER_05]: in like a valley that they were hiking in
and hiking out.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were camped there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They found food there and said these guys
had been camped for a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very covertly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, the people that owned the land around
there were oblivious to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they had irrigation system set up
coming from the river running downhill,
[SPEAKER_05]: watering all the plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, it was perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like a movie set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I can, uh, I mean they had three
different places.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you go out there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was, I mean, it's, it's hikeable.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's this area where we can hike to
just went out there and hike.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll let them tell you about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they, they clear cut a good seven
acres of, you know, just prime national
[SPEAKER_01]: forest trees, you know, full sized trees,
just cut them down, clear cut them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, no thought to drainage or,
uh, no respect for the environment
[SPEAKER_01]: whatsoever to be the hippie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I was told it was a mess out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew one of the, uh, not to blow too
many fucking whistles, but I know a friend
[SPEAKER_05]: of mine's father is a retired cop and he's
cool as shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, my buddy's a dab head and dad's
sitting on the couch next to his dad who
[SPEAKER_05]: was a cop at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, he was telling us that there were
plants out there of all stages,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, eight inches tall, 12 inches tall,
three feet tall.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said there were bags of buds and a
manicuring station.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was tripping out because when this
place was discovered was not flowering
[SPEAKER_05]: season, it was, uh, it was like spring or
some shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was saying that they already had
plants six foot tall, three foot tall with
[SPEAKER_05]: big buds on them in flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's no way that they could have
set up like a per or a light depth out
[SPEAKER_05]: there on seven acres.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, without being busted, uh,
they were using auto flower plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, uh, that's the best use of auto
flowers I could ever see.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're trying to do some crazy
outdoor where you've got enough time
[SPEAKER_05]: before the cold, right after the cold,
get those in the ground, you might be able
[SPEAKER_05]: to pull off an outdoor crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they were living up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they had quite the little city and I
may or may have found a plant and may have
[SPEAKER_01]: moved it down just to see what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah, it was totally an auto
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could there have been any seeds up there
by chance?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, probably so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the plant I found was actually a male
auto flowering plant, which is,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, I killed it, burned it, stomped it
into the ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you fuck a male auto flower plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's super, super dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just going to bust in your room
one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spencer's eyeballs are about to pop out of
his head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you feel when you find a male in
the grow room about three weeks into
[SPEAKER_05]: flower?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's only happened like once and I
don't know, it's probably one of the sad,
[SPEAKER_05]: not saddest days, but I can compare it to
the feeling of when a condom breaks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like you walk in the room and you,
cause you can tell once it's like that far
[SPEAKER_02]: in, if you can't tell something's wrong,
um, it's just kind of heartbreaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause at that point you don't know,
like you don't know what it hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it hit, if it's dropping pollen,
is it not dropping?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just too many questions.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and then when you find some seeds in
your nugs, you know, a month and a half or
[SPEAKER_02]: three months later, it's like,
well, bam, there it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the results.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Saw it go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you guys pay attention with the males,
that room, that plant in the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see a yellow dust on your leaf,
I discovered a male one time by that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those nanners just erupted.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, keep an eye on your feminine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I seeds too, because fem seeds can turn
into hermaphrodites or males.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I hope we actually covered something.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got dabbed as shit on this episode
talking about this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I hope we made some sort of sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to stress my point again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grown from seeds is awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything came from seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a, if you grow for the curiosity
and just the level of the plant and you've
[SPEAKER_01]: never grown from seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I question your curiosity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you grow from seed, I grow from
seed cause there's a possibility of
[SPEAKER_02]: finding something that people don't have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's my, that's my answer for you
right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I would literally, I'll grow a pack
of seeds to find a female that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, maybe two people out of what
couple hundred people that have bought in
[SPEAKER_02]: packs have, you know, who knows one day
that strength could be, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: everything you want it to.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've seen seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I forget the term for it, but I have
bred seeds that the outcome has been
[SPEAKER_05]: better than both parents.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it got more vigor and more trichomes
than the two parents I used and I
[SPEAKER_05]: upgraded.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, so that's a good, good way to look
at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got something in your brain there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that term.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't, I think DJ short might have
recently said it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody said it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually looked it up when he said it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody tweeted to us at agro culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll send you a two irie genetic stickers.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really will.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really, really will.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe something cooler.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I can find something to send you,
it will not be seeds or anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: I promise.
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't ship seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey guys, stop shipping shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: A friend of ours got in trouble for
shipping shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would call him a friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: This, this person in the community that is
not anymore in the community, uh,
[SPEAKER_05]: got fucking busted shipping shit and it
makes us all look bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes Colorado look stupid.
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes you look stupid.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, stop shipping shit, please.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want some shit, come get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, it's legal in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're 21, uh, the dispensary has what
you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have to mail it to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, sorry to bust up anybody's business
ringing for making some money shipping
[SPEAKER_05]: shit, but there are plenty of sick people
out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are plenty of people here.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are plenty of recreational people
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We fought to get this shit right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, it's legit here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop shipping shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone agreed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck middleman anyways.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow your own straight to the grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Grow your own.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're listening to this podcast,
you're probably not one of the people that
[SPEAKER_05]: ship and shit anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't even need to bitch at you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're growing your own herb.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got some quality dabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're hanging out with us.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys got anything you want to bullshit
about?
[SPEAKER_05]: I like having you on.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't need to cut off a conversation
here just cause I'm out of material to
[SPEAKER_05]: talk about on the seed stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got anything fun to add?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there was a news or a story in the
news.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, shit, I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesse's high.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember where you saw it?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go Google.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll hit the cannabis right quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the weed news hits the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was it about?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was comical.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm trying to remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say like, I may have seen it in
the post or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I am not sponsored by the cannabis or
anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people disagree with what the
cannabis says.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes they print some articles that I
will agree are fucking wacky.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right as I opened the cannabis,
there's an article that says cannabis Q
[SPEAKER_05]: and a grow room tour and other reader
questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, check out that grow room tour.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to read that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't read it yet, but that'll be any
grow room tour is fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: You might learn something there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ask me if you have questions about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: The three of us in this room, uh,
we could design and build you the most
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking amazing grow room.
[SPEAKER_02]: God, somebody, somebody let me build one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let the three of us build it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll, we'll crush it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be the Lamborghini of a grow room,
bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see much on the, uh, the cannabis
worth reading on the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Next time we'll have some news for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll find something to read.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause got anything cool to add.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to, uh, everybody over at the
garden of Whedon while Spence is away.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope they're all behaving themselves and
having a good time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big Mike, Maddie, slop, nannies,
sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rock boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, boy?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, boy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Earl, Earl, Earl, Indica.
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a house full of ping pong,
sloppy ping pong is not here, but shout
[SPEAKER_05]: out to him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big shout out to ping pong.
[SPEAKER_05]: We love you always, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: We miss you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Had to ship out, had to ship out so you
could shape up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, what are slop's little pups names?
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are cute as fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always forget Bain and Bain and Harvey.
[SPEAKER_05]: Harvey's the one I forget his name all the
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those dogs are cute as shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good work on those two little pups,
bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't sound like we got a lot of
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you got some to say?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Izzy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I missed Izzy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not very familiar with that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we, can you pause recording real
quick?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to ask a Spencer question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Possibly have a story to tell.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll, uh, I'll hit pause right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to hit pause and make sure
that what we can talk about is talk
[SPEAKER_05]: aboutable on a show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I'll just turn the mics down and
the music up and you guys get down for
[SPEAKER_05]: half a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're recording now.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're coming back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we're back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yo, uh, that story was not appropriate for
listeners, but, uh, you missed a fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: hell of a story.
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't air that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, that's somebody's personal shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there any events coming up?
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I think the, uh, secret cups coming
up, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: The secret cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: The regional is, uh, 30th and 31st are the
open vendor days where you can come and,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, check it out, I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I've got my, uh, my VIP spot set
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there'll be a bunch of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, everybody in the industry that is in
Colorado will show up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, shout out to big D for putting that
on.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do a lot of shout outs on this show.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a lot of love.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the mountains.
