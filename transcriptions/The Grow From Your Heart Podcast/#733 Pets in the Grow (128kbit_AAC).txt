[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said I wasn't going to ramble too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the main topic of today's
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let me let you know how I got to this
point of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been, um, maybe co-parenting,
maybe pup sitting some dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got two wonderful dogs hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see them, uh, just behind the
cameras.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're chewing on some bones,
keep themselves entertained for a while,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it brought me up to the point where I
was able to answer all of your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, a bunch of great stuff to talk about
for the podcast here.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first question is, do you take your
dogs into the grow space?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my big question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer not to have the dogs in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I operate, uh, I was operating in a lot of
commercial environments, a lot of large
[SPEAKER_00]: grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, my grow is a large part of my
livelihood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So taking a dog in there, uh, I don't have
any fear that these dogs are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: damage the plants, any equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to get into anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty good dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but what about all of the pests,
the things that are in all of their fur.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying those dogs are dirty,
but we went for a walk today and I watched
[SPEAKER_00]: one dog run through the lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one rubbed up, up against a
couple of bushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go on hikes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go out in the woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go out in the desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go out in the trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: These dogs are gathering all sorts of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do we bring our dogs in the grow rooms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we do, I fear we are spreading
those, whatever they gathered into the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also then I think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, am I bringing that in just on my
pants, on my shoes and my dreadlocks?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's disgusting, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever the dogs walked across,
they snuggled up against me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on my pants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on my clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on your clothes and your pants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I just happen to have dreadlocks down
to my ankles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, maybe calves, maybe I'm exaggerating.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do hit the calves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I got dreads at least past the knee.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a lot of opportunity to gather
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so am I any worse than the dogs or the
dogs any worse than me?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was something I was thinking about
today on a very stoned dog walk,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we will talk about a little bit
later, but anything that ends up on that
[SPEAKER_00]: dog is going to end up on your shoes,
your clothes, your pants, your t-shirt,
[SPEAKER_00]: your dreadlocks, your arms, uh,
your car seat, your couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you're out in the woods or out at
the forest or out at a hike, wherever you
[SPEAKER_00]: may take the dogs and I said hike,
I apologize if you caught that both times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you're out there with the dogs,
whatever you get on you, if it's a tick,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's a spider might, if it's a fungus
net, whatever you could, if it's a fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: tree spider, if it's a wood spider,
a wolf spider, a black Brown recluse,
[SPEAKER_00]: a black widow, a Cobra.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm exaggerating here, but anything you do
pick up, you're going to carry that to the
[SPEAKER_00]: car.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get in the car seat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get in your clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to come to the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get in the couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you changing clothes immediately when
you get home?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you vacuuming out the car all the
time?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm curious about the dogs in the grow
space, grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally choose not to let the dogs in
the grow, but I walked the dogs and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: came in the house and I went and I had to
do some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to quickly change clothes and then
go to the grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm wondering, are there any things
that I just introduced to that girl?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the dogs to death.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a kind of a barrier to figure out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another thing you have to think about
when you have dogs around is all the dog
[SPEAKER_00]: hair in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to have a dog that lived here with
me for several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: She passed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jen dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys remember the old shows back in
the day, sometimes you'd hear her
[SPEAKER_00]: footsteps tap across the floor here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we were recording big up to Jen dog,
miss you boo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but that dog would get dog fur in the
photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the dog fur would end up on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd go take a great cannabis photo,
nine out of 10 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best photos I ever took would have a
little piece of dog fur in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ginger would be in the photos all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we used to say that you could tell a
bag of weed is real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good weed and it was grown with
love.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are a couple of dog hairs in your
ounce, that's how you know it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big up to all the growers out there
with a dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you take your dog into the grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like your dog is, uh,
compromising your integrated pest
[SPEAKER_00]: management strategy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that something that we need to improve
or work on?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we do have our dogs around and the
outdoor grow, bring the dog around the dog
[SPEAKER_00]: works as security.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dog loves the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dog's good companionship and the
indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may choose not to bring the dog in
there, but like I rambled on about,
[SPEAKER_00]: am I just carrying the things I snuggle
with the dog?
[SPEAKER_00]: I took touch the dog, scratch on the dog,
make silly dog voices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I walk into the house, change
clothes, walk into the grow room where the
[SPEAKER_00]: dogs are, where the plants are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably didn't clean up well enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely something in the dreadlocks
carried some shit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's see where we are now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next part of this ramble festival is
do your dogs enjoy consuming cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your pets enjoy consuming cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, these dogs I babysitting now are not
fully mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not comfortable blowing any smoke in
their direction yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, when I'm given permission by their
parents one day, their main parent,
[SPEAKER_00]: their mommy one day, uh, then maybe they
may get stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so far at this point, those dogs have
not been stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did have pets in the past that some of
those pets love to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of those pets hated to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned Jen dog a minute ago,
shout out to ginger, the dog, ginger hated
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: She would not, she didn't want to be
around the smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: She didn't like edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: She did not want anything to do with weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it got too smoky in the car,
too smoky in the room, uh, she would try
[SPEAKER_00]: to find a way out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have to open a window, give ginger
some air.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I had some cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would smoke weed regularly in that house
through a big bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a really cool big bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I would get out that bong and
start breaking up my weed, those cats
[SPEAKER_00]: would just come surround me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd sort of start circling me and just
meow, meow, meow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I take a big fat bong rip and I
wouldn't blow it directly at the cats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd blow it kind of at the floor and they
would just go bask in that smoke and they
[SPEAKER_00]: would get stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after a couple of bong rips,
the cats would leave me alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really think the cats loved to smoke
weed with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love to get blazed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime I would roll a joint, bust out the
bong, those cats would be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just come cruise around and do
they, when they rub up against you and
[SPEAKER_00]: they purr and I'd blow them a couple of
bong hits and they'd leave me alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd be content and they just go do cat
shit around the house and be dicks like
[SPEAKER_00]: cats do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, however, ginger dog, if you blew a
bong rip at her, she'd growl at you and
[SPEAKER_00]: put her head down and try to hold her
breath and be like, dude, why did you just
[SPEAKER_00]: do that to me?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're ruining my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jen dog hated bong rips.
[SPEAKER_00]: These dogs um, when I turn on the dab
torch, they come wherever they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I fired up the dab torch, if they're in
the living room, if they're trying to go
[SPEAKER_00]: out to the backyard right now,
they're chewing up bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I fired up the dab torch, they'd come
hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they enjoy either, uh,
hanging out with me while I dab or they
[SPEAKER_00]: want to get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to ask their mommy for permission and
she will tell me no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll never find out if they like
smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, where am I on the notes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, with that being said, I'll never force
smoking upon an animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never give an animal, um,
edibles or anything that they,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they don't smoke, I'll never do that to
a dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jen dog, uh, ate edibles one time that
were, uh, they weren't meant for her to
[SPEAKER_00]: eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: She stole them off the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never thought she'd do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was a better dog than that at that
time, but she stole some edibles and got
[SPEAKER_00]: high.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was too high and she did not enjoy
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was fucked up for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after that, I never gave her edibles
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: She never wanted to smoke, uh,
but I would never force it on an animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys do not force Medicaid your
animals unless maybe if you're giving them
[SPEAKER_00]: like CBD for a medical condition,
but if you're just getting them high to be
[SPEAKER_00]: a dick, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're giving, if you're treating them
for a medical condition and they're,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, every animal's resistant to taking
medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know they'll take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll eat everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not supposed to eat until you try
to give them some medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh, that's good for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't eat that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not rabbit poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to eat that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Animals are trippy like that, but let's
not force our dogs to get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not cool unless they really enjoy
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, something I was going to talk about
ginger dog, Jen dog, dude, there's nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned earlier, those stoned as fuck
dog walks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is nothing like getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultra blazed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may allegedly have done this this
morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have taken excessive dabs this
morning and got these dogs all laced up on
[SPEAKER_00]: their leashes and went for a really nice
dog dog walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing like getting lit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going for a long blazed dog walk in
the sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got the dogs just cruising.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got someone to talk to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people probably think I'm crazy
because I talked to those dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're fucking humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of my buddies talk to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got very unique personalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go for a walk in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get super blazed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Jen dog, my dog ginger back in the day
before she passed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was like 10, 10 30, maybe 11 o'clock
at night in the spring and the summertime,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe early fall when it wasn't too cold
here in Colorado, it gets cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fuck the winter dog walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That that's another story.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the nice weather time, if my dog
saw me grab the grinder and some papers
[SPEAKER_00]: and a bag of weed, she'd watch me.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'd be like, oh shit, he's rolling a
joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 10 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's rolling a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'd watch me roll up a joint,
roll up a couple of joints and set them on
[SPEAKER_00]: the side of the desk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if she saw me go get my shoes and
shoes and socks, she'd be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might be time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she start wiggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get all excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I grabbed that leash, that dog would
know, oh my God, we're going for a 10 o
[SPEAKER_00]: 'clock joint walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be one of those nights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd just go walk around the
neighborhood and smoke a couple of joints
[SPEAKER_00]: and just walk the dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something about that was just so
satisfying, so pleasing, so relaxing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just cruising the neighborhood with my
dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like, uh, I'm a, just a weird
looking dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'm a fucking tall white guy with
dreadlocks down to my ass, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of a nicer neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So walking around late at night here in
the morning, walking around here for no
[SPEAKER_00]: reason may look a little bit sketchy,
but if I got the dog, you got a really
[SPEAKER_00]: good excuse to be out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just a guy, a hippie guy walking the
hippie dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks really natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who wouldn't expect me to be smoking a
joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you saw my hippie ass walking with my
dog and I wasn't smoking a joint,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you'd think I'm up to something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So smoking a joint lets you know what I'm
up to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out walking my dog, smoking a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here comes a dog to say, hi, hi boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't interrupt the recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't knock anything over.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to come sit by me because he
heard me talking about him, but going and
[SPEAKER_00]: walking and smoking a couple of joints is
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody cares that I'm out there smoking a
couple of joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time, if anybody does say
anything, by the time I'm done walking
[SPEAKER_00]: past them, they forgot about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by the time anybody would show up
to harass me, the joint would be out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just walking dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nothing like a nice 10 30 11 PM dog
walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dog would get so excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: She may see me roll those joints,
grab my shoes and she'd just be watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is he going to get the leash?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is he going to get the leash?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as I would have the leash in
one spot, I would keep it up on top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fridge just out of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you saw me reach up there, she'd be
like, Oh God, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she started spinning in circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: She knew that was the coolest shit ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have been rambling on long enough
about walking our dogs and pets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me make sure I covered all these notes
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they're carriers of bugs, but we love
them so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're worth their bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, those things end up in your clothes
and your shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you change your clothes and your
shoes before you go into your grow space,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially after playing with your animals
that may be helping you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, is there dog hair in your photos?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we know you got pets.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's dog hair in the weed,
that's how we know you're growing really
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't force your pets to consume
cannabis unless you're giving them some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of medication, some sort of medicine,
uh, getting them high, especially blowing
[SPEAKER_00]: it in their ear and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's completely rude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I got to go take something from
the dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what he's got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to edit this out,
but, um, hang on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go get some shit from
Rafiki.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am back through the magic of editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for hanging out for a minute while
I solved some dog problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is enough rambling about dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know, tweet me, uh, send me a
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you do want to contact me on
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is at GF Y H podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email or reach out on the grow
help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you allow the dogs in your grow space?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe even send me pictures of your
cute dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm down with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping an eye on this dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he's fired up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's feisty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into some emails before I've
got to wrap up this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want their name set.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't even have their name on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, when you think a mother plant
needs to be replaced, do you grow them or
[SPEAKER_00]: just ditch them?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of controversial between Mike
and myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I've had bad luck growing them out
mostly just really low yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: One strain just died two times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I was listening to your latest
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk of your love of comedy and podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should try the ice cream social.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he sent me a link to the ice cream
social.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do my best to remember to check
that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a link.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes it easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up for being a podcast and a comedy
fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about mother
plants and if we should flip them or just
[SPEAKER_00]: toss them and replace them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really all about your strategy or
needs your wants and your goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I place my mother plants about two,
maybe three times a year, depending on the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights, the plants, the health of the
plants, just timing the way shit goes
[SPEAKER_00]: every three, maybe every six months ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they do need a replacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do take a bunch of clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I get them potted and rooted,
then I cut down the big plants and throw
[SPEAKER_00]: them away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or sometimes they get moved into a
flowering room or sometimes they will get
[SPEAKER_00]: taken outdoors and bloom outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the determining factors are I'd like to
know what I'm going to do with those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants before I start taking clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already know that I need them for
mothers, for genetic preservation,
[SPEAKER_00]: to provide clones, just to keep that,
uh, that genetic alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That cultivar needs to exist via the
mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times I will know my goal for
that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ultimate goal is it going to be,
is it going to go outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to get tossed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be a big clone donor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to go indoors to get flowered?
[SPEAKER_00]: I already have that goal in mind when I
start taking cuts the very first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say I just got a new plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make it a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: This microphone is my new mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm going to, I'm going to grow it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I take cuts off of it,
I've got a strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this going to end up outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to end up in the flower room
indoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to make a bunch of clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it just going to end up dead on the
floor?
[SPEAKER_00]: After I've got the cuts I need,
I will start that plan from the time I get
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the time I cut this clone and grow it
into a plant that I can work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got an idea of what it's going to
be 90% of the time I always take that main
[SPEAKER_00]: top right out of the middle, just to make
the bottoms grow up and catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to be my first clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I usually go to the bottom and
take three or four clones off the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: just to clean it up and lollipop it,
uh, make, give it a little bit of health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I can start making it spread out the
way that I need to from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's going to go outside, I want a lot
of tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make it a big bush.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's going to go indoors, I have to
keep it short and squat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I take lots of clones off the top all
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's going to be somebody that is just
going to donate a lot of clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will top it low early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize if you hear the dog drinking
water in the background, things are
[SPEAKER_00]: different here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will make adjustments and get this
corrected, but you may hear the dogs
[SPEAKER_00]: drinking right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if I'm going to make a lot of clones,
I'll top it early.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way it will spread out real far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll just keep topping it to give
me a lot of heads and a lot of tops and
[SPEAKER_00]: every intersection where I get a node
coming up and there's a branch coming off
[SPEAKER_00]: one way and a branch going one way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll cut it right between those,
cut the peace sign out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I get two tops and then I'll do
that again and repeat that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way it can make a bunch and a bunch
of clones that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll probably end up getting cloned to
death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as soon as I get roots off of my
clones, that one gets chopped down and
[SPEAKER_00]: thrown away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all about what I'm going to do
with that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ultimate goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want to put it outside, it'll get
fucking topped and spread out real far.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm going to put it indoors,
it's got to stay squat and low because my
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor environment is kind of low.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's going to be a clone donor,
it gets topped early, spread out a lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: pulled down so I can make a lot,
a lot of clone material from that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all about the original or the
ultimate goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I get that clone, I already know that
idea before I start mothering that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have an idea of where it's going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they do need to be replaced about
every three to six months, maybe more
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently, depending on the health of
your plant and your grow environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: the rate of growth, the whites,
you've got the genetics, my Congo plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got that Robert's Creek, Robert's
Creek Congo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That fucker grows three times taller and
faster than everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to top her, replace her every so
often.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chem daily chem grows super fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, that, uh, the unicorn poop
doesn't grow at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't need to replace that one very
often.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just makes a few shoots, super easy to
manage, super easy to handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all about the genetics,
all about the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I grow them or just ditch them?
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they go outside and get
pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they go outside and make big
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I cut a bunch of cuts off of
them and give the cuts to my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kind of depends on the ultimate
goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it says you've had bad luck
growing them out, mostly low yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because probably I'm not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: But probably just a poor preparation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're more focused on them being mother
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you're more focused on them providing
cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not preparing them to be
flowered plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not giving them, uh, the proper,
uh, the proper preparation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was hard for my brain to even put
together, but they weren't prepared
[SPEAKER_00]: properly to be flowered plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're only focusing on them as mothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oftentimes we don't focus enough on
the veg or the mothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think we just need them alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need them in there when they get into
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll really spoil them, really take care
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is not really a, a good way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a best practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a good solid foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the foundation starts at the mother
plant because you want a healthy mother
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to provide a healthy clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strong clone turns into a strong veg
plant, turns into a bad ass flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't start off with a crappy weak
mother plant or an unhealthy mother plant
[SPEAKER_00]: or an unhealthy clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to have the veg, the moms,
the clones, everything all the way up to
[SPEAKER_00]: dry and cure harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: All has to be a hundred percent top notch
if you want it to be top notch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not accusing you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not pointing fingers, but a
possibility and option is that maybe your
[SPEAKER_00]: veg room, your mother plants aren't
getting the care, the love that they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not as healthy and optimal as
you can have them when it is time to
[SPEAKER_00]: flower them and make buds out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one thing that could be occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I don't know the situation,
but I'm just going with what I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't feel like I'm accusing you,
blaming anything on you, although it's
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, maybe they're just not prepared
and then it says one just died.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they root bound?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they getting too root bound?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they going, uh, are they in larger
pots before you flower them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they going their whole lives in a
three, a five, a seven gallon pot?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're flowering them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you overwatering them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just the stress and the shock from
going, uh, from being a mom plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: being in veg constantly into a flower
room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you putting them outside?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of variables here,
but I would think maybe, uh, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting root bound or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're just dying or maybe that light
stress is killing them, or maybe you're
[SPEAKER_00]: overwatering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think it is an overall plant
health issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not treating the mother plants from
the very beginning as plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be flowered.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're using them just simply as genetic
preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they're not getting the love,
the care, the attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not robust enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have the strength, the vigor to
follow through and continue as powerful
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my guess, my estimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I don't have a lot of information
here, so I'm just going with what I can
[SPEAKER_00]: guess with, um, dude, thank you for the
great recommendation on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is more info to this,
please do follow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course you've got my email address.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it looks like you send it to grow from
your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do send it that direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get your mother plants dialed in so
that we can keep you on a perpetual cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will actually take their
mother plants, cut a few clones from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, then flower the mother plants so that
they don't ever actually have a mother
[SPEAKER_00]: plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a perpetual cycle where we're using a
mother plant, a veg plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you veg it, grow it, cut clones from
it, uh, then put that one into flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: then grow some of those clones out,
veg those, put those into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a perpetual cycle without a mother
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we can keep you, uh, in healthy
plants, we can create a perpetual cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: that way without any struggles and without
plants dying early in the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have one more question here in front
of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to cover this one from our
friend Dinger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our buddy Dinger from
Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's me, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says much love from Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for putting out the positivity and
directness into the show and your work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not fuck around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad it's noticed that I'm here to
teach directly, try to get the message
[SPEAKER_00]: across, try to speak in a way that
everybody can understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in the seed game, I try to get out
that is reliable, that is solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to waste anybody's time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you guys work hard for your
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Money is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You choose to give me money for your
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure you get a quality
product that will give you a quality
[SPEAKER_00]: return.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my ultimate goal there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make you happy with me so that when you
see me at an event, you don't go,
[SPEAKER_00]: man, I gave that guy money for seeds and
they sucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to say, I gave that guy money
for seeds and they were some of the best
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds I ever grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to come and give me a hug and
be happy about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not fuck around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I do like to have a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we're fucking around the whole time,
keeping a smile on our faces while getting
[SPEAKER_00]: shit done.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to go referee a dog wrestling match.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody is in their own corners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody's going to regroup.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've called a truce for the time being.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody's distracted and busy
for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back into this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize for the distractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does say I've been growing for two
years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within the last nine months with help
from your show and the dude grow show,
[SPEAKER_00]: I went from harvesting shitty genetics and
a substandard plant environment to growing
[SPEAKER_00]: some dank genetics and even making my own
silver thiosulfate solution fem seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: growing out dank that I have bred myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, that is such a great sentence to
read.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You went from, uh, it sounds like you were
kind of struggling and trying to figure it
[SPEAKER_00]: out to breeding your own seeds and
harvesting them and growing some dank from
[SPEAKER_00]: those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a full, a full circle,
a full cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are self-sufficient now, my dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how that feels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, welcome to the gang.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I just popped a pack of soca
souffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for that bubble gum cough
syrup turp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you find that one, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I couldn't thank you enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dude, you are very welcome,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for, uh, the encouragement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the compliments and
congratulations on your, uh, improvements
[SPEAKER_00]: and your success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it does say onto the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just recently picked up a pack of seeds,
which were labeled GMO BX three F two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already see where this is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could get confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is a description.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the Larry OG clone was crossed
into SFV OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: To provide the original male pollen on the
first bat cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: The breeder selected plants from the BX
three to make his F two seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it does go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says how much variation would one
expect to find in a second filial
[SPEAKER_00]: generation of something that has been bat
crossed three times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks from Dinger.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one part here where it says the
Larry OG clone was crossed to SFV OG to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: To make the first original bat cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then that's not a bat cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an outcross, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless Larry OG and that's not,
so anyway, we're going to skip that part
[SPEAKER_00]: because parts of that right there do make
it sound a little bit wonky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what that part is about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about this labeling of GMO BX
three F two, and then we'll answer the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I want to cover this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So GMO BX three, that sounds like just a
bunch of random stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody has the GMO plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about GMO before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not stand for garlic, mushroom,
onions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that out of your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what it stands for.
[SPEAKER_00]: GMO is called GMO because it smells like
crazy chemicals and it's got girl scout,
[SPEAKER_00]: the strain girl scout cookies in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it got popular, the girl scout
cookies were under scrutiny for it being
[SPEAKER_00]: discovered that they were using
genetically modified organisms in their
[SPEAKER_00]: fancy ass girl scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the time they called the girl scout
cookies cross that smelled like chemicals,
[SPEAKER_00]: GMO ask skunk master flex.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quit making shit up you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: GMO we've got a GMO BX three.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that somebody took a GMO plant
and they back crossed it to one of its
[SPEAKER_00]: parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this story that I read, part of it is
convoluted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to leave that part out,
but we're going to say for the sake of a
[SPEAKER_00]: real talk here, they took the GMO plant
and BX threed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means they took the GMO plant,
probably the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they took the GMO plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got the female GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they take a male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a parent of the GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the story confuses me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I don't know the exact parents of
the GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it was Larry OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it was SFV.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to leave that part out,
but we'll talk about this just for the
[SPEAKER_00]: sake of what the real BX three is.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took the GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they took a parent of the GMO to make
it a real back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take a parent of it and pollinate that
to the new GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just a parent pollinating a child,
which sounds crazy, but in plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: does work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's a back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took a parent, a child and we pollinate
went back and got pollen from a parent and
[SPEAKER_00]: put that on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've made our BX one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to grow those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to find a plant that looks
just like the GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they could have done a couple of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure which way they did it,
but at this point you take pollen from one
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and put it on the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we're using the parent plant and
the offspring to keep going original
[SPEAKER_00]: parent to further generation offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea here is to lock in those traits
of the GMO to make it look just like GMO
[SPEAKER_00]: every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we back cross it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this would be done because maybe we
don't have an original pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we've got a female, maybe we've only
got a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back crossing could be done for several
reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do explain the pollen they use,
but that dilutes the story of the back
[SPEAKER_00]: cross and that makes it confusing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know enough about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got our back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took a parent and we pollinated a
female, one of the children.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we found a child out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we pollinated that child again
with our original parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we did it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did that three times, three back
crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take a batch of the BX3, the back cross
third generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a handful of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we grow those and we find a boy and we
find a girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have to go referee a dog fight,
but we'll edit that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find a boy and a girl and we breed
those together.
[SPEAKER_00]: What comes from those is now the F2
generation of that back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made the BX1, the parent to the child.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we found a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we took a parent to that child.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we found that seed and we took a
parent to that child.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a BX3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we take a batch of those seeds and
find a boy and a girl and breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a filial, an F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a BX3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also that is the F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a first filial generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you make something,
it's technically an F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an F1 of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll find a boy and a girl from that
F1 and breed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have now made the F2 filial generation
of that back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a BX3F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a lot to get to to explain that,
but that does make sense if you follow it
along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the question is, how much variation
would one expect to find in a second
[SPEAKER_00]: filial generation of something that has
been back crossed three times?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a definite, definitive,
solid answer because it is all about
[SPEAKER_00]: selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the proper selections were made,
it could be very uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the proper selections were not made,
it could be fucking wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a couple of things working for
us and working against us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The BX3, if done properly, should be
narrowed down to where approximately 85%
[SPEAKER_00]: of the phenotypes will represent the
original parent they were trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: replicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If done properly, 85 to 92% ish of those
seeds should come out looking like the
[SPEAKER_00]: original parent we had intended to
replicate in this back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this was done correctly, there's no
correct or incorrect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about selection and intuition and
allele charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then honestly, seeing if nature worked
the way we hoped it would when we did the
[SPEAKER_00]: cross, sometimes you nail it, sometimes
you fucking miss it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the time when we do the cross,
see if it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't, you got to go backwards
another generation and just start over
[SPEAKER_00]: with different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we did the selections properly,
by the time you get to that BX3,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have got really stable, really locked
in expressions of phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it gets crazy when we make F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: F2 is kind of the Pandora's box of
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you make the F2, that's where we see
plants that look a lot like mommy,
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that look a lot like the daddy,
but then we also see grandparents of both
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and grandparents of those
grandparents of both plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: F2s can sometimes find the most amazing
plants you've ever seen and also the worst
[SPEAKER_00]: plants you've ever grown in the same
batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the potential of an F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may find amazing fire in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may find complete garbage in there
because we're opening up a Pandora's box
[SPEAKER_00]: of genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that is available is in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see traits, like I said a
moment ago, traits from the mom,
[SPEAKER_00]: traits from the dad, then traits from
mom's mom and dad and traits from dad's
[SPEAKER_00]: mom and dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you may, if you understand and
know the expressions and the parents of
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants, you may see further down the
line on both sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the F2 is where you're going to see
weird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So honestly, I can't answer your question
directly because we've got a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the BX3, which if done correctly
is really locked in, then the F2 is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to open Pandora's box.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not sure how much of Pandora's box
was washed out by the BX crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we selected properly, we pushed out a
lot of that bullshit that we didn't want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may or may not appear in the F2
generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't done this, so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it talks about the Lario G clone
crossed into SFV to provide pollen in the
[SPEAKER_00]: first back cross, which means now we've
got GMO, and Lario G and SFV.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could see traits of the Larry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see traits of the SFV.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see traits of the original GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see traits of the chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see traits of the Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see traits of Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see a lot of different traits in
here, a lot of different variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not exactly sure how to answer that
because I've never done a BX3 then F2'd
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The BX3 would get me where I needed to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the F2 may cause problems,
may unlock Pandora's box.
[SPEAKER_00]: May just lead you to F3 it so you can
relock in the traits that you lost from
[SPEAKER_00]: F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may just stick at the F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: The BX3 is probably, I would have gone BX4
is what I would have done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But shout out to the breeder that did
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I was more clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand they use the Lario G to SFV
to make the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to use something to make a back
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you open it up and then put it back to
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to start that project somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not have a direct answer for you,
my dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for that, but I think I
rambled on long enough to give you ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see Larry traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see SFV traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see chem traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see cookies traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how the selections were
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be completely uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be completely wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the phenotype that works best for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clone that bad bitch and grow it forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got seeds, maybe make that F3
filial generation, if that's something
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my dude, Dinger, I want to
thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a really good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got me going for a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got me rambling for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls,
pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers,
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, clone cutters, dog people,
cat people, even people without pets.
