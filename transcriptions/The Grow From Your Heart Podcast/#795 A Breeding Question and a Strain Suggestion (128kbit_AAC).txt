[SPEAKER_01]: I do have several wonderful emails that I
would like to read.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the first one was sent to me by a good
friend and they asked me personally to
[SPEAKER_01]: read this on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is what I do for my friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my buddy, Turkey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if I read your message on the podcast,
that does mean that you win a free pack of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so Turkey, it looks like you have
turkeys yourself into a free pack of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please send me your address.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a might need your address
anyway, according to this email.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one, my friends goes a little bit
like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, dear Rasta Jeff, I hope this
letter finds you in good health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel good, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Said I'm writing to you with a request
that is both unusual and urgent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I like to like to help out when I
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, you see, I am in desperate need
of a baby brother who can shred on the
[SPEAKER_01]: drums.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have reason to believe that you are
just the man for the job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when I first read this, I thought
this guy was calling me his new baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I am a, I'm a decent drummer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can hold my own on a drum kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can rock it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can play some funk, some reggae,
some blues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, don't change time signatures without
warning me, but I can keep up and play
[SPEAKER_01]: some odd times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can read and write music.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I thought this was going to be
about me being the funky drummer,
[SPEAKER_01]: baby brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does say, now you may be wondering
exactly how you can assist in this matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fear not for I have a proposal that I
believe you will find both intriguing and
[SPEAKER_01]: enticing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this is where it really gets weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says my mother, who is a lovely and
talented woman in her own right has long
[SPEAKER_01]: harbored a desire to start a family with
someone who shares her passion for music
[SPEAKER_01]: and who better than you rasta Jeff with
your prodigious skills on the drums and an
[SPEAKER_01]: unmistakable love for all things rock and
roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, this has taken a quick turn for the
weirdest, but I'm going to keep reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, think about it with your genes
and my mother's musical prowess.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could create a child who is destined
for greatness on the drum set.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our friend here would like to create a
breeding project between myself and his
[SPEAKER_01]: mother so that we can F one a baby brother
for him with traits from his mother and
[SPEAKER_01]: myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great project.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that you saw that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good eye for breeding my dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, so what do you say rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Will you help me fulfill my dream of
having a baby brother who shreds on the
[SPEAKER_01]: drums?
[SPEAKER_01]: I promise that the rewards will be many
both in this life and the next sincerely
[SPEAKER_01]: from Turkey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize for giggling in the end there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to hold it together for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whole message.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, my friend, Turkey, um, there's a lot
to commit to, to this here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that I want to, uh,
I'm not sure that I can, uh, agree to this
[SPEAKER_01]: at this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend, I'm going to have to politely
decline the offer here, but, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: that is, uh, not to say that you can't
check back in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Things may change.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may, uh, there may be a software update
that does change my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's our first breeding question for
today's episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one did come from my friend,
Turkey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I do feel, I have not met your mother
yet, but I do feel that I could pass on
[SPEAKER_01]: this drummer gene, this rock star vibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: That may be an option.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a daughter who is quite a rock
star.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Turkey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks once again for the great breeding
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not able to help you out at this time,
maybe in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's just a long commitment,
my bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure that I want to commit to that
whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to have another child.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already got one who's fucking
awesome, which by the way, I did pass on
[SPEAKER_01]: some amazing traits to that child.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't want another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want 18 more years of doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want to teach somebody else
how to play the drums right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, politely, I'm going to have to
decline, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know what I say, take a fat dab
and give your mama a hug for me,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do send me your address.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you do get a free pack of seeds for
that message.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, no matter how ludicrous and or
entertaining that was, let's keep the show
[SPEAKER_01]: moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's actually jump into some truly
cannabis related content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys for hanging out and
listening to that funny message from my
[SPEAKER_01]: friend, Turkey.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came from the grow help tab on
the iREGENETICS website.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to iREGENETICS.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the top, there's a row of tabs,
just like most websites.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one you can click on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you click on that, it will ask you a
couple of short, like a, a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: questions about your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the temp?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the humidity?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we do give you the opportunity to
type in your grow questions that we can
[SPEAKER_01]: help you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, if you send a question to
the grow help tab, and I do read that here
[SPEAKER_01]: on the show, you in a free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that free pack of seeds is sponsored
by our friends at seedsherenow.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to the whole crew at
seedsherenow.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big extra fist bump to my buddy Lucas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's keep it moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: This message came from our friend who
wants to be called Tommy2Trikes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my buddy Tommy2Trikes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tommy, please do send me a message with
your address.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be happy to get you out of pack of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's read the question here on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, yo Rasta Jeff, I'm a medical home
grower in the great state of Illinois.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to our friends out there in
Illinois.
[SPEAKER_01]: The message does continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I'm looking for strange
suggestions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've come to the right place,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, here is my situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a two year old puppy who is
suffering from terrible seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now we're taking every medicine the
vet can offer at the highest dose
[SPEAKER_01]: possible, yet the dog is still suffering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seizures are heartbreaking to watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone or something you care about is
flopping around and you can't do shit
[SPEAKER_01]: about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's heartbreaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been there before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know how you feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's got to be scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish the best for you and your dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that we are able to help you out in
some sort of way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope the cannabis community can help you
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I got my hands on some chronic
CBD from Sirius Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown it and made him some good boy
treats.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a super good dog dad of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, unfortunately, there's too much
THC in this strain and he gets way more
[SPEAKER_01]: stoned than I want and more stoned than he
wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've seen some dogs get too damn
stoned and that's also heartbreaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's funny for about 10 minutes,
but then you're like, fuck, that dog's
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking suffering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, it says, would you have a strain
that may offer us some relief but not fuck
[SPEAKER_01]: this dog up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, this is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do need to jump in right now and see
[SPEAKER_01]: if there's anything that I can do to help
you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not qualified to give true,
solid medical advice or veterinarian
[SPEAKER_01]: advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to make that disclaimer just
because people are fucking litigious these
[SPEAKER_01]: days and I'm not trying to get sued for
saying some silly shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not qualified to give medical advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, and also I'm definitely not
qualified and people are going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: something to say if we start talking about
giving your dog cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are against that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not against that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the cannabis is a healer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we do it properly, if the dog's into
it, you guys know that one of our the dogs
[SPEAKER_01]: I was around often loves to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I smoke, he comes and stands next to
me and gets mad if I don't blow him some.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if the dog enjoys it, it's all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's going to be activists on the
other side saying that it's wrong to give
[SPEAKER_01]: your dog cannabis to help this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's what I'm going to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a veterinarian, but if this were,
I'm not a veterinarian or a doctor,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if this were one of my friends who
were near me, I would offer them something
[SPEAKER_01]: more of a, it sounds like what you grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've lab tested it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know how much THC to CBD is in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would find something that is just CBD
that doesn't have any THC in it if
[SPEAKER_01]: possible and see if that helps with the
seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I would start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something just CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: You haven't lab tested your product,
so we don't know the levels in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the levels in that product.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I would recommend is starting with
something just CBD, but of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, not gas station CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would recommend cannabis derived,
American made, lab tested CBD that we can
[SPEAKER_01]: trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure where you're going to get
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many people will say a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many people will have other
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Illinois, I don't know your options,
but I would get some tried and true,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, something, a reputable brand of just
CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this were a person that I knew,
this is what I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to stay away from the dog
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I get myself in trouble, but you know
what I'm talking about here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'd recommend something with just CBD
and see if that stops the seizures without
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking up the person or the dog that
you're giving this to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then if that doesn't work, then I would
work on something with a one to one,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, THC to CBD ratio, uh, something that
has got an equal amount CBD to an equal
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way I believe I don't, I'm not a
doctor, but I do believe in the entourage
[SPEAKER_01]: effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: The synergistic effect is what it's also
been called.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that when we isolate cannabinoids,
the CBD, it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think when we isolate THC, it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we combine those two things and
the certain ratios that work for each
[SPEAKER_01]: person's body, that's when I think they
work the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: They work the best in conjunction with
other cannabinoids, esters, terpenes,
[SPEAKER_01]: palliates, all the other products,
all the other compounds that come with the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they all work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think you may need to find the
correct appropriate balance for your
[SPEAKER_01]: patient, which in your case is your dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would start off, you've been giving
them something that we don't know the lab
[SPEAKER_01]: results of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would start off with something we do
know lab results of all, all CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can get it, then I would go with
something CBD and THC and monitor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if the CBD works, stick with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it doesn't, then add some THC to it
slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, a strain that I can recommend that is
in my arsenal that is not available on
[SPEAKER_01]: iREDirect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't sell this strain, but it is
available if you need it, reach out to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, right now I'm swamped with
emails, but I'm doing my best to dig
[SPEAKER_01]: myself out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've got a strain that is called
purple heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does often produce phenotypes with a
one to one THC to CBD ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: So however much CBD is available in the
plant is also available in the THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we are finding outliers of phenotypes
that do, uh, become THC dominant and
[SPEAKER_01]: outliers that are THC that I say,
which one they lean one way to THC one way
[SPEAKER_01]: to CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are phenotypes that you'll find all
types of different cannabinoid ratios,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the majority of them put off a one to
one THC to CBD ratio when grown and dried
[SPEAKER_01]: and cured properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would recommend a strain called
purple heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did say that's not available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, purple heart was made in a friend's
grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I full disclosure, I guess I have
a friend who I rent grow space from and he
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted me to breed with one of his plants
and it was a CBD dominant plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he is, um, he's a veteran.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has served for the United States
military.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said that this CBD plant that he
smokes helps with his night terrors and it
[SPEAKER_01]: helps with his PTSD from being in the
military.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to cross that to something and
make feminized seeds with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I rented his space, one of his
requirements of the space rental was to
[SPEAKER_01]: put that plant in there and breed to it,
to make something even better for the
[SPEAKER_01]: veterans, for the people that experience
PTSD, the night terrors, the other
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms that come from being in combat
and being exposed to things that would
[SPEAKER_01]: probably traumatize most of us for the
rest of our lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that plant helps with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to make something like that with
my lineup.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said that his cherry plant was really
good, but it could be improved upon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew that my afterglow pollen donor was
going to be amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put the afterglow and the cherry CBD
plant in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did magic together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of that comes purple heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I promised my friend that I would never
sell purple heart seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave him a good portion of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a good portion of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every purple heart seed that has ever
left, uh, the irie genetics office has
[SPEAKER_01]: been for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've given them to veterans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've given them to people with PTSD,
uh, night terrors, uh, traumatic problems
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to help them out with the purple
heart seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are not a lot left right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do need to make more, but my friend,
if you contact me, I will send you a pack
[SPEAKER_01]: for your dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do want a prize pack here for having
your message read on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not send you some purple heart?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully we can help out your canine
companion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out doggy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a good boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you're doing well, or you're a good
girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why I just gendered your dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good doggy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, let's make sure I covered up all the
notes on this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm not a veterinarian.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rasta.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff is not even my real name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, I would recommend starting with
CBD and then add some THC and see how they
[SPEAKER_01]: work and then figure out the ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take some dosing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's unfortunately that's the,
uh, for me, that's the fun part for some
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the challenging part of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to recommend exactly what to
take because it's all about how our bodies
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to act and react to that
cannabis, the different terpenes,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the different cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: That all hits us differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the kind of guy that I'll smoke a big
fat fucking dab of some sativa
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrates that most people are going to
have a panic attack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that puts me right in the zone to come
talk on a podcast for 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people would be freaking out,
running from the lights or having a hard
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I smoke a heavy, heavy Indica,
uh, most people get like kind of lazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: A heavy, heavy Indica makes me want to go
for a walk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our bodies are way different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got this ADD brain that just keeps
going, makes me talk a million miles an
[SPEAKER_01]: hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things work differently for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I rambled on about this one for
quite a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy, Tommy, two tracks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I hope the dog as well, because the
dog is man's best friend and it just sucks
[SPEAKER_01]: to see a family member suffering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be happy to help you out with those
purple hearts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me your address.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been going for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have another message here in front of
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came from our friend who wants to
be called Billy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to our friend, Billy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for helping me generate listener
generated content.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am rambling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've had too many dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: This message goes a little bit and quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like this, it says two questions,
please, my bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, do you ever give your plants cloudy
days by that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, dimming the lights, like maybe
when temps are a little bit hot,
[SPEAKER_01]: then it says I've been doing that for a
while and they seem to like it,
[SPEAKER_01]: or am I wasting my time?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it might be my imagination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I would never turn down the lights in
my grow space unless it was required.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it was way too hot, the air conditioner
couldn't keep up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ventilation couldn't keep up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not turn down the lights unless there
is a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get them at their peak, uh, their peak
performance that the, the amount of light
[SPEAKER_01]: that the plants want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can kind of see what, if there's too
much or not enough light in there at this
[SPEAKER_01]: point, I've been working with the LEDs for
a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get the plants to their peak
performance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I do not turn down that light or
unplug a light ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, basically think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like these plants are the UFC fighters of
plants are cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put them in a cage, you put them in a
four by four tent, and then we expect them
[SPEAKER_01]: to fucking let's get ready to rumble every
single day in that grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in there for nine or 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's only 63 to 70 days in the flowering
phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want, and then we've got the veg phase
is equally as important as this phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should touch on that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people overlook the importance of
the veg phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the foundation that is building
the foundation, the framework,
[SPEAKER_01]: the veg phases equally as important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in any phase, I do not turn down the
lighting because think of it like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a nine week training camp and at
week 10, we got a fight coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you had a fight coming up, you're going
in that cage and you're going to swing it
[SPEAKER_01]: out with whoever your favorite UFC fighter
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, would you train every day or would you
go 70% some days?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you know that the other guy is going
to fucking 110% every single day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got to get in there and go at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my theory is no, I would not turn down
the lights unless it was detrimental to
[SPEAKER_01]: rescuing the crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it got too hot, then I would consider
turning down the lights, but no,
[SPEAKER_01]: that is the main source of fuel and energy
for our plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what makes everything else happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that's what drives photosynthesis,
uh, which is what drives bud production in
[SPEAKER_01]: the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would I turn that down?
[SPEAKER_01]: So no, I do not give the plants cloudy
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's cloudy outside, it's the brightest
fuck in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's raining outside, brightest fuck in
the grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's hot as fuck outside, try to keep
it decent in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a struggle sometimes, but no,
I do not turn down the lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not give them cloudy days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I focus on making sure those plants get as
much light as possible before they start
[SPEAKER_01]: getting problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, make sure they get as much light for
as long as they need to keep them in the
[SPEAKER_01]: proper cycle I need them in and to get top
performance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no, I do not change the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a part two to this question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, are plants that start seeding two
to three weeks into flower worth keeping?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, why are they seeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my main question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, uh, will they concentrate on
making seeds and not flower at that point?
[SPEAKER_01]: I always throw away the garbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're my guru, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lay some knowledge on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got some things to talk about
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have asked, uh, if plants that start
seeding two to three weeks into flower are
[SPEAKER_01]: worth keeping, there's got to be a reason
why the seeds are popping up at that stage
[SPEAKER_01]: in the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, usually plants aren't even able to
start producing seeds until about,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, they can, as soon as the pistols are
there, they can produce seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're not going to see seed
production for several days.
[SPEAKER_01]: After those pistols pop up, they've got to
get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds have to start developing.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I'm wondering if what you're
actually seeing is seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm not doubting you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how long you've been growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to know if those definitely are
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like a very seasoned experienced
grower to look in there and look at those
[SPEAKER_01]: buds and say, no, those are calyxes or no,
those are seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could be swollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brax is what you may be identifying as
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it a squeeze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does the bubble thing that looks like a
seed, does that pop and is there a seed
[SPEAKER_01]: shell in there or is it just juicy,
uh, plant juicy?
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll, it'll have like a popcorn kernel in
it, but give it a squeeze.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if there's a seed in there or see if
that is a swollen bract.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could be very mistaken.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of new growers see those little
bracts that developed right at the bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: of the node and they think that that's a
seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not, that's a bract.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be too paranoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the next thing I want to say is why
did seeds happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: If these are seeds, why did they occur?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is causing this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there pollen in the room?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, have you had a male plant in that room
and not cleaned it up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a male plant in the room that
you haven't identified?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's skeeting on the ladies making
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe my other idea, maybe which are
identifying as seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe those are male anthers farming on a
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you got a male plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, also my next question is, was there an
intersex plant in this room or are those
[SPEAKER_01]: plants themselves intersex?
[SPEAKER_01]: I really want to get down to where did the
seeds, what caused the seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, first question is like, really are
these seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Next question would be where did the seeds
come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's got to be pollen or an intersex
issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, uh, the next things I would start
thinking about is, uh, have you over or
[SPEAKER_01]: underwatered drastically, um, at any point
in late veg or early flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there like a huge flood?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or a drought?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those things could lead to intersex or
possibly, uh, maybe this is early
[SPEAKER_01]: rotalization, self seeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's what's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is your vapor pressure deficit dialed in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it too hot in the room?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it too cold in the room?
[SPEAKER_01]: How's your humidity?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it too dry, too moist?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, are there drastic swings of either of
those things in any drastic swings of any
[SPEAKER_01]: of the VPD can definitely mess up your
whole crop and give you, uh, intersex
[SPEAKER_01]: traits could definitely give you,
uh, seeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not convinced these are seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more I talk about it, um, my next
question is how about light leaks?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you getting any light leaks in your
flowering phase?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, when I say light leaks, some people
don't understand exactly what I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: The light leak means an interruption of
the dark period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is very photo period sensitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we put it in a dark period for
12 hours to make it flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we interrupt that dark period,
the plants get a little bit confused and
[SPEAKER_01]: they start going into what the fuck mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine, just imagine if you will,
maybe one day you're outside, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the sun goes down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, Oh, it's like seven 30.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sun went down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go inside and do whatever I
do from seven 30 to bedtime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you do your thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You smoke a couple of bowls.
[SPEAKER_01]: You watch a podcast, you hang out on
discord, eat some ice cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go to bed, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then suddenly like three in the
morning, the sun comes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just boom, the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to look at the window and
you're going to go, what the fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be a good feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to say, that's, that's the
sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to look at all of the clocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to look at your phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to go three o'clock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three PM.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's three AM.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to the iPad.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to go three AM.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to the microwave three AM.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to look at the, look at the
computer screen three AM.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to look at your watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause maybe you got a watch that's analog.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't fucked up yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three AM.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all three AM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is the sun up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you're going to go to social media
and you're going to see that everybody on
[SPEAKER_01]: the fucking planet is freaking out that
the sun's up at three AM.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to go into full on panic
mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine if you were a plant, you've got
options.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can freak out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can freak out emotionally,
physically.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can try to procreate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the plants are going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants are going to try to procreate
before the end of the fucking world.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you start flipping the sun on in the
middle of the night to them, they're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to go, what the fuck, dude, cannabis is
whole goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main purpose of a cannabis plant is to
reproduce and make seeds for next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the plant thinks that Armageddon is
fucking coming, that the sun just reversed
[SPEAKER_01]: its schedule, it's going to go,
Hey bro, I'm going to die.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to make some seeds and she's
going to start spitting out seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: naturally because it doesn't know what the
fuck is going on with the world and it
[SPEAKER_01]: wants to survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like Jurassic park.
[SPEAKER_01]: Life will find a way that plant will just
spit out seeds because it thinks the end
[SPEAKER_01]: of the fucking world is coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, this plant, possibly if there are
light leaks, um, this plant maybe woke up
[SPEAKER_01]: one night at three o'clock in the morning
and went the fucking sun's up,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Made a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may not happen from just one light
leak, but if you've got several
[SPEAKER_01]: interruptions or a consistent
interruption, or perhaps there's one area
[SPEAKER_01]: in the grow space, it's just not sealed
off the lights getting in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somewhere I've seen the light come in
through like zipper holes in the tents,
[SPEAKER_01]: the ducting holes in the tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we use the lights with the reflectors
inside of the tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I've seen the light come down
the duct, uh, just from the room and come
[SPEAKER_01]: down the duct and then illuminate the
whole tent because there's a ambient light
[SPEAKER_01]: in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could be from a light leak,
could be causing your seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the bottom line is I want to know what
is causing, first of all, I want to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure these are seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I want to know what is causing me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it pollen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it intersex or was it a room problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it a light leak?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, what is causing that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I would make a determination if I
would run those plants any further.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm seeing seeds at week two or three,
um, I'm thinking I've got more shit to
[SPEAKER_01]: worry about than just the strain
selection, but it very well could be,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, bad genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know who you're running.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what you've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have that detail in this email.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a shorty.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I'm going to say, make sure that
those are seeds, go give it a squeeze,
[SPEAKER_01]: see if that's a seed in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, then if that's a seed in there,
find out if there's any pollen or intersex
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, then check on all the other
parameters in the room, which I listed the
[SPEAKER_01]: vapor pressure deficit, uh, over and under
watering, and then go in the room and turn
[SPEAKER_01]: off the lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when there are lights on in the rest of
the area, so I don't know your situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know your house.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know where the grow is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be, uh, in the jungle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be in the New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know where you're, where you're
growing right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're in a shed, but if you've got
lights in that room at the normal time of
[SPEAKER_01]: when that tent or whatever is functioning,
go in your grow space, whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: when there are other lights on like day
light outside, preferably go in the tent
[SPEAKER_01]: or go in the room and turn off all the
lights and sit in there for long enough
[SPEAKER_01]: for your vision to adjust to that room.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can see anything in that room,
there's too much light.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a hundred percent darkness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to a grow space one time because my
friend told me they just won't flower
[SPEAKER_01]: properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I, I really think this is
a light issue and we couldn't figure out
[SPEAKER_01]: why.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was daytime outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I said, turn off all the grow
lights in here, turn off all the lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see where the light is coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we turned it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we realized a window that he had
boarded up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The light was just coming through little
pieces of the plywood and there was just
[SPEAKER_01]: full sun coming into that room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means when it was dark in that
grow space, whatever light was happening
[SPEAKER_01]: outside, if it was a porch light,
if it was just the sunshine, if the lights
[SPEAKER_01]: went out before or after, if the,
the sunshine in the dark space didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: coincide it, it would fucking interrupt
the dark cycle in his grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: His plants were never going to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to read dark re black out that
section.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could be a very welcome,
could be a light leak.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy, Billy, that's your name,
