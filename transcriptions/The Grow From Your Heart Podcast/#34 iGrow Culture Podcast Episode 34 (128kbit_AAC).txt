[SPEAKER_02]: I had a great long discussion with Mike
and Jesse.
[SPEAKER_02]: It starts off with just some random
chatter I decided to hit record.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I'd leave that in the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: So without further ado, here comes the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So quite a while ago, man, how many years
ago was it when we had Medamar going,
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike?
[SPEAKER_03]: Five, four, five, six, somewhere there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pot years ago, between five and eight
years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was close to seven or eight years ago,
possibly by now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember what year it was.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: 08, 09.
[SPEAKER_02]: 08.
[SPEAKER_02]: 08.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was 08.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's been six years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So about six years ago, Mike and I were
employed at a dispensary together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was mostly the dude in charge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I managed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bud tended.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cleaned.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I applied for the job with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then like I was told you weren't the
manager and then you were the,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, that place had structure
issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's definitely, uh, I was hired.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was, I was hired as the guy there
to help transplant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You kept the place from like wandering
away, like the customers from like
[SPEAKER_03]: carrying the furniture off and the
employees showing up on time and not
[SPEAKER_03]: stealing everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were, there were a lot of chiefs and
no Indians.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one day I talked to the boss and
I was like, I was straight up with the
[SPEAKER_02]: boss.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, dude, you are a great pot
grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a good man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a good business, but honestly,
you have no idea how to run a damn
[SPEAKER_02]: business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he kind of laughed at me the way that
he did.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a Southern guy and he's real laid
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he just chuckled at me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might be right about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he handed me the keys to the shop and
he said, here, you have a dispensary and
[SPEAKER_02]: see what it's like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, man, I miss the good old days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you?
[SPEAKER_02]: So from that day, I pretty much had a
dispensary and we, we rocked that place.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did, uh, I had days over $10,000 in
sales at one day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think of it as the time I had the best
job ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the wild wild west.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was definitely the wild west kids
coming in with quarter pounds and
[SPEAKER_03]: backpacks and, um, boss handing you three
edibles at the beginning of your shift and
[SPEAKER_03]: asking how they tasted four minutes later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, dude, those are two,
we got to elaborate on both of those
[SPEAKER_02]: topics.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would be at work, just serving
customers, cleaning up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have reggae playing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have my laptop on the desk playing
music.
[SPEAKER_02]: People would come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I'd have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd be smoking a joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a vaporizer set up at the bud bar so
that we'll, to be fair, we usually smoke
[SPEAKER_03]: joints upstairs away from the customer
service area, but there was plenty of that
[SPEAKER_03]: downstairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the beginning, I was reckless and just
smoking joints because it was,
[SPEAKER_02]: there were no rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were no rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was everybody had a medical marijuana
card.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could be smoking medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there weren't any things to worry
about, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're all in there smoking and
customers are coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: People would show up and be like,
Hey, do you want to check out this sour
[SPEAKER_02]: diesel that I grew?
[SPEAKER_02]: And be like, I sure do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they'd offer it to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give it to you for this much a
quarter pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd be like, well, you see what we
sell at four and eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to give me a deal on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'd get a good price together
and we'd start selling that person's
[SPEAKER_02]: quarter pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the good old days, the good old days,
Mike would grow a quarter pound and bring
[SPEAKER_02]: it into work and put it on the shelf for
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every employee had something on this shelf
that they had arranged and had a little
[SPEAKER_03]: profit cut off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that mine was little infused
candies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I of course had herb on the shelf that I
was growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of white rhino and cherry widow was
coming from my gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd be able to, so I would take my
quarter pound that I grew in my basement
[SPEAKER_02]: and take that to work, sell it to the boss
essentially for a specified price.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then get an hourly rate to stand there
and sell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Push my product that I just grew so that
it'll sell out sooner so that I could
[SPEAKER_02]: bring another quarter pound back to work
tomorrow and make a little more bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the boss would come to you at the end
of the day and be like, great job.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want more of that from you,
bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone's happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the benefits of having that job
was I got to see a lot of cannabis and one
[SPEAKER_02]: thing I got one day off every week.
[SPEAKER_02]: They made sure to give me, after a while
we hired more people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got two days off a week, but I had one
day off a week and I would spend that one
[SPEAKER_02]: day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would drive to another city and not be
the dispensary employee.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would go in as a customer to as many
shops as I could and just go do recon work
[SPEAKER_02]: at all these dispensaries and see what
they had to offer and see how their shops
[SPEAKER_02]: are set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: See what who's working there and see what
the bud tenders know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm always that guy, if I'm doing
something, I want to be really good at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I always go, well, let's see what the
best looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go try to see what I want to do and
also learn what I do not want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I saw so much shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: We saw a lot of ways to do it wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was so much shit available.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some shops that you can smell
that musty hay, improperly cured and dried
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis smell in the waiting room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, I just want to leave.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can already tell that this is going to
be B grade product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my feet wet of growing commercial
cannabis in one of those places.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how challenging is it to go from being
an outdoor grower to being like a,
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to call you a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're an indoor, they call us basement
growers is what we're labeled as,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, that's a derogatory term.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you've got the right basement,
it's not that you can't be a really
[SPEAKER_03]: awesome, sexy basement grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that it's still sort of a dig.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like caregiver, private caregiver,
something along those lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: How were your changes going from being a
caregiver in a residential grow to having
[SPEAKER_02]: a gigantic commercial grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say on a commercial grow,
you're not growing weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're managing a schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of a plant management,
no fund intended, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to keep all the wheels
greased and rolling and functioning
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you start into a grow that didn't
have that mindset to begin with,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's quite disastrous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had to come in and kind of take
over for somebody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to learn that from, you know,
I, I have no complex education.
[SPEAKER_03]: You learned that the hard way in the
middle of it, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trial by fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sink or swim.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also I got to give you credit because
the shock that you were thrown into,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, they did not provide the proper
equipment supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, actually there was one before that,
but yeah, no, that one was a joke to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you learn a lot from having to deal
with a joke at least?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, tremendous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Learning what not to do is just as
beneficial as learning what to do.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, sometimes it helps to figure out why
you do it that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: By seeing how, what happens when it's done
wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people can only learn that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've worked for a few of those people.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just have to stand back and let it
crash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made a completely amateur mistake the
other night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I've got a gorilla glue plant and it's
growing out of control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sort of, it's kind of mainlining,
but not really because I'm not cleaning
[SPEAKER_02]: everything off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just trying to pull it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I split that bitch right down the middle,
trying to pull one side too far from the
[SPEAKER_02]: other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, one piece of duct tape and a twisty
tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a little clone gel.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I thought about it, but I just
thought I panicked and was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just wrap this up now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get out of here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just quick first aid, splint it and
go.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's happy four or five days later.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's happier.
[SPEAKER_02]: She looks stronger there than she did
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, they're hearty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Made a super new mistake.
[SPEAKER_02]: So going on, you had something,
go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I was just going to say there was a
reason they called it weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It grows like a damn weed if you do it
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, going to all those dispensaries
through, I've been to shops from,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, Pueblo, Colorado, Springs,
Denver, uh, East and West of Denver,
[SPEAKER_02]: both directions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I haven't gotten up to Boulder or Fort
Collins to the dispensaries, but it seems
[SPEAKER_02]: like, Oh, I have, but you're no shops in
Fort Collins.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was up a couple in Fort Collins before
they got killed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, a long time back in the bad old days
again, but, uh, they were about like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you'd see everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there are good and bad examples and
the good examples range the spectrum from
[SPEAKER_03]: very culturey to very medical.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so do the bad ones, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of both.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that the huge regulation has
changed the quality and product?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes and no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it hurt and helped it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, a lot of the incredible growers
couldn't handle the regulation when it
[SPEAKER_03]: first came down and then quality dropped
and it stayed kind of down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I don't want to bash it too bad,
but quality dip for a while when the best
[SPEAKER_03]: growers were all forced out of the legal
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it took a while for the people who
were great at business and great at
[SPEAKER_03]: following regulations to catch up with
making a great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were industry leaders for a while
and I think now solid product is more
[SPEAKER_03]: common than shady product.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then again, I'm not up at the shops as
often as I'd like to be to say this shit
[SPEAKER_03]: with more confidence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that kind of annoys me,
we made all these regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: To prevent shitty weed, pesticides,
mildews, problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still getting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They haven't, they don't go inspect the
bud at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just pay attention to the dollars and
the sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't care about the products or the
safety.
[SPEAKER_02]: They check on the edibles and make sure
the edibles are the proper dosage.
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that, they don't really
care.
[SPEAKER_03]: There isn't a regulatory system for safety
inspections for smokeables other than
[SPEAKER_03]: through tobacco.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Colorado didn't really have that
infrastructure with the food stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kitchen safety and all of those rules are
already in place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we saw what happened when those first
inspections came out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody at the table kind of smiled and
looked at them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, AJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say, Dave just recently
started enforcing these.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw AJ at the secret cup over the
weekend and it's good to see him smiling
[SPEAKER_02]: back on his feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: His little Yoda rig is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, AJ?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see you, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you listen to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: AJ Hashman, shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over a hundred people got dinged and it's
not like they were doing anything that bad
[SPEAKER_03]: or that wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just their first taste of what the
high-end food quality regulations really
[SPEAKER_03]: looked like in a medical edible production
kitchen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like even Dixie got hit and they're the
ones that are like the shining example in
[SPEAKER_03]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: As the regulations come down, the people
that were great at following them have to
[SPEAKER_03]: step up and figure out how to be great at
growing weed too because they haven't been
[SPEAKER_03]: practicing for 20 years because they were
terrified of breaking the rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why they're good at following them
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you can't find my product on
the shelf because they changed all those
[SPEAKER_02]: rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think when it was all the basement
growers and the caregivers doing it in the
[SPEAKER_02]: basement, it got taken into a shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it did because all the cameras,
all the regulations, all that stuff is
[SPEAKER_02]: super expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: The big expense to start off is the
property.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you can find a landlord willing to
give Uncle Sam his property to let you
[SPEAKER_03]: live your dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, thanks dad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than that, you ain't finding it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you got to buy the property yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unless you've got a million dollars,
you're not owning a retail property in
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not anywhere other people live anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I know several people that are on
the look for property.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always that hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raise his hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a grower's standpoint too,
most dispensary owners are more at this
[SPEAKER_00]: day and age are more of a business-minded
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you said, know nothing about
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can be incredibly hard to work
with from a grower's point of view.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I would have gone to business
school instead of learning to be a super
[SPEAKER_02]: good pot grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to business school.
[SPEAKER_03]: These regulations are confusing as shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It ain't the lack of schooling.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're better at business than most of the
people that I went to DU Business School
[SPEAKER_03]: with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you dropped out of society and went on
tour while they went to college.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have a lot to do with how well
you did in business school.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the life experience was priceless.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, following the regulations is
really a question of, are you willing to
[SPEAKER_03]: pay your lawyer?
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to have that capital to have that
lawyer because the weed lawyers are
[SPEAKER_02]: ridiculous right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: From my perception, kind of from the
outside, because I really don't do a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of shop shopping or not as much as I'd
like, but the really successful shops that
[SPEAKER_03]: have a handful of locations, a reputation
for amazing, consistent product are the
[SPEAKER_03]: ones that really invested in a good grower
and setting up a grow that that grower can
[SPEAKER_03]: really run.
[SPEAKER_03]: And paid the shit out of that lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kept him happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many shops died because the grower and
the business people got in a pissing
[SPEAKER_03]: contest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And rather than succeed, they just peed on
each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the most popular dispensaries in
the state does not have their super
[SPEAKER_02]: popular grower and grow team anymore
because of recent political changes they
[SPEAKER_02]: chose to make.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't call out any names, but yeah,
that was a terrible breakup.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was kind of sad to see that,
but it did make for some great new
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunities.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Onward and upward.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of onward and upward,
my mic sounds all echoey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys hear that in the headphones?
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I echoey to you too?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tiny bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that fix it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cause I got your mic turned up real
hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm learning how to work sound equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only took me 34 episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I may edit part of that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the reason that Mike, actually Mike and
Jesse have been contacting me,
[SPEAKER_02]: talking to me about this topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: This, I was sleeping on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike thankfully is a super active member
of our community.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes to city council meetings.
[SPEAKER_02]: He supports cannabis any way that he can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse works at a hydro shop and try and is
also a farmer, a grower and tries to do
[SPEAKER_02]: what he can to stay up on politics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't pay attention to the local news to
tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just pay attention to the world and
national cannabis news and the state news.
[SPEAKER_02]: So luckily Mike brought this to my
attention and Jesse had some stuff to add
[SPEAKER_02]: to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put these guys in touch and then they
were like, we got to get on the podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was their idea to do a show about
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So big shout out to these guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys for giving me material.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: What should I just start telling the
story?
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of took some notes and I've got a
little opening, an opening statement,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, let me try that again without a
frog in my throat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says city staff is attempting to draft
a new ordinance that would ban all indoor
[SPEAKER_02]: growing in the city of Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to make the rules that say,
they want to make rules that say we have
[SPEAKER_02]: to grow in a separate building detached
from our house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is bullshit because of many
reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that pretty accurate what I wrote
there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not just indoor home growing though,
all home growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So no greenhouse in your backyard.
[SPEAKER_03]: No just out in your backyard.
[SPEAKER_03]: No in your basement.
[SPEAKER_03]: No in your bedroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: No little grow cabinet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which means everything at your local hydro
store is pretty much pointless because you
[SPEAKER_03]: can't use any of it unless you build a
special outbuilding just for your six
[SPEAKER_03]: personal cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many of us can afford to build a
special outbuilding just for our cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have six of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hot topic in the Chieftain the last
couple of weeks has been revolving around
[SPEAKER_03]: several people in the city not being able
to afford trash service, electricity
[SPEAKER_03]: payments, things like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're talking about having people
build a special airtight smellproof
[SPEAKER_03]: building so they can grow six pot plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, technically three because you're
only allowed three in bloom at one time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'd only have three stinky flowering
plants in that building ever at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would also affect caregivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's using a 64 as reference, but it would
also affect caregivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would just be... It would affect
everybody in the city.
Outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that going to make it easier to
steal?
[SPEAKER_02]: Harder to take care of.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be another building.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have to get a building
permit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to need to wire that
building.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, everybody in the neighborhood would
know that that's why the six people on the
[SPEAKER_03]: block are in the neighborhood or whatever
just built that special new building
[SPEAKER_03]: behind their house.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have to own your said property.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first place my mind went is it's a
huge kick to Black Hills because everybody
[SPEAKER_03]: who has been using a greenhouse or
following the very letter of the law and
[SPEAKER_03]: just chain linking their plants into a
cage and essentially growing them purely
[SPEAKER_03]: outdoors in their backyard, but in an
enclosed locked space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you've got to put them under expensive
grow lights with fancy air filtration
[SPEAKER_03]: equipment and all of that's just a huge
give to Black Hills.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you said that you had an idea of why
this ordinance was being drafted.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a couple of weeks ago, and I'm the city
council policy nerd, I go attend just
[SPEAKER_03]: about every meeting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was there two weeks ago listening to the
interviews for the new city council seat
[SPEAKER_03]: and then for the budgetary meeting they
had after that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And during the budgetary meeting,
just sort of offhandedly, a couple of the
[SPEAKER_03]: council members referenced a complaint
they had all received the previous week
[SPEAKER_03]: from a homeowner on the South side who's
an elderly gentleman and wakes up every
[SPEAKER_03]: day to the stink of marijuana plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now everybody sitting at this table is
like, you asked, why'd you say stink?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's because that's how this old guy
sees it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what he called city council
about and being city council and not
[SPEAKER_03]: having a whole lot to do other than please
your constituents and respond to stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: A number of them drove out to this guy's
house and gave it a smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Sandy Daff said it was very strong
from the driveway.
[SPEAKER_03]: She pulled up into this gentleman's house.
[SPEAKER_03]: So next she pulls up next door and she can
smell this guy's garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve Narake said that he didn't really
smell it, but when he was standing in the
[SPEAKER_03]: backyard, he could clearly see several
plants over the top of a privacy fence.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it gives you an idea of how big this
caregiver was doing in his backyard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it doesn't sound like he's meeting all
of the basic city code stuff because they
[SPEAKER_03]: weren't enclosed or locked.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were just in his backyard.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the cops have been out at this guy's
house.
[SPEAKER_03]: His neighbors are pissed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would any of you ever stink out your
neighbors like this?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pretty easy way to bring problems
on yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be embarrassed if my neighbors
smelled me every morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: As an indoor grower, I try to be really
covert.
[SPEAKER_02]: My neighbors, I'm certain my neighbors
know what I do because they've seen me
[SPEAKER_02]: carrying things.
[SPEAKER_02]: They see my dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know who I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've seen my Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: They probably listen to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my neighbors, one of my neighbors
was a vendor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what he sold exactly,
but he brought me a large box of lighters,
[SPEAKER_02]: fresh lighters.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, I'm pretty sure you guys smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want some lighters?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that big gigantic box over there is
that's all lighters, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm serious.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my neighbors know what's up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I still I try to keep it on the down
low.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not calling city council on you
saying you're a bad neighbor because they
[SPEAKER_03]: don't wake up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be mortified.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clearly my mother did not raise whoever's
growing these pot plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So city council went out there and during
the meeting the other night, they
[SPEAKER_03]: mentioned sort of offhandedly that they
had all received this complaint and they
[SPEAKER_03]: all agreed that this guy should be able to
wake up in the morning and not smell his
[SPEAKER_03]: neighbor's pot plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they didn't really say anything else
about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They kind of chuckled about the smell and
contact high got thrown around a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit and they went on to they were busy.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were going over budgetary stuff in
the city's millions of dollars in the
[SPEAKER_03]: hole.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it got dropped pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: And being who I am and doing what I do all
day, when I read the article in the
[SPEAKER_03]: Chieftain today, I called every city
council member in Pueblo and three of them
[SPEAKER_03]: called me back today and discussed this
issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of them said that this isn't
something that they asked for or that
[SPEAKER_03]: they're aware that any other council
person asked for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rather it's something the city staff has
put together based on those offhanded
[SPEAKER_03]: comments at the council meeting the other
night.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is all the brainchild of somebody
in planning and zoning who's attempting to
[SPEAKER_03]: please his bosses who might not or whom he
decided might want a weed can't smell weed
[SPEAKER_03]: in Pueblo type ordinance.
[SPEAKER_03]: The city council people I talked to all
use the word unenforceable or all agreed
[SPEAKER_03]: that any sort of ordinance that covered
growing pot in a basement or in a garage,
[SPEAKER_03]: like all of that is unenforceable.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't send somebody to every house in
Pueblo and check.
[SPEAKER_03]: So essentially if you're not being a jerk
and stinking up your neighbor to begin
[SPEAKER_03]: with, there'd be no way for them to find
you making this totally pointless.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't see it really going anywhere,
but regardless, everybody who gives a shit
[SPEAKER_03]: needs to show up on the 13th at seven p.m.
[SPEAKER_03]: at the city council building down on Union
and Grand.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're the city council guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be telling me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't look at me with a question mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: I drive there without thinking at this
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's Union and
Grand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will tweet the correct address.
[SPEAKER_02]: What Mike is saying, guys, we want to go
on October 13th to city council and tell
[SPEAKER_02]: them that this proposed idea is
unacceptable and that it will not work for
[SPEAKER_02]: us.
[SPEAKER_02]: While you were talking, I came up with an
alternative, a cannabis courtesy law.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a don't ask, don't tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we can smell it, you got to turn it
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a cannabis courtesy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to see more of a public service
announcement that's like don't be a
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking asshole.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can say you can say that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not charging you a dollar,
but like it's it's a common courtesy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be mortified is the word I would
use to describe it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not embarrassed, not ashamed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking mortified.
[SPEAKER_03]: If my neighbor smelled me every morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're growing 30 or 40 cannabis
plants as a caregiver, you're putting
[SPEAKER_03]: yourself at risk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your patient's medicine at risk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just having that wafting down the alley.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we already had one kid get shot in
the stomach with an air rifle this summer
[SPEAKER_03]: because someone's too stupid to put their
shit in a fence.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you throw a chain link fence over it,
teenagers aren't going to bother.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can barely work scissors,
let alone freaking wire cutters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of them are so lazy that they're not
ready to steal unless it's right in their
[SPEAKER_02]: face anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing in town, don't don't
push the limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that's the thing we're
getting at.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like all of this is because one guy is
being inconsiderate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're all going to get punished for
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That kind of sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody who would like to grow their own
cannabis plants in the city of Pueblo now
[SPEAKER_03]: has that right in jeopardy because one
jerk on the south side is stinking up his
[SPEAKER_03]: neighbor's house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two jerks because somebody had to shoot
somebody also.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure that contributes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's surely not helping anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's another jerk out in this
county.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost said too much of the
neighborhood, but he's the main thing for
[SPEAKER_00]: the county kind of doing the same thing
that they're wanting to do the same thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that the city is going to do or try to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the county is talking about proposed
plant limits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They are talking limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But regardless of caregivership or
anything like that, it would be 18 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, 18 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 plants per single family residence,
12 plants per apartment or multifamily
[SPEAKER_00]: residence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it limits or forbids outdoor growing
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, you know, that's ridiculous,
especially in the county.
[SPEAKER_03]: The forbidding of outdoor growing is just
a silly gift to Black Hills that they
[SPEAKER_03]: don't deserve.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sun is free, abundant energy and
plants are meant to be outdoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the only reason marijuana was forced
indoors to begin with was prohibition.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about you guys, but I love
some summer outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you say a lot of ridiculous shit,
but that thing you just said about the
[SPEAKER_02]: only reason marijuana was forced indoors
was because of prohibition is one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: greatest things I've ever heard you say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every now and then a diamond falls out
along with all the coal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're kind of full of crap, but once in a
while you spit out a real gem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people moved to Colorado,
to the Pueblo area to grow outdoors
[SPEAKER_02]: because this is an ideal climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the reason that most of the army
troops that have been to Afghanistan and
[SPEAKER_00]: Iraq go through Fort Carson for training
before they go there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it gets them acclimated to the
similar environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're up this altitude, the air is thin,
the temperature is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the Hindu Kush Valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that mean that when they take over
and they all come here that they're coming
[SPEAKER_02]: to Pueblo?
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado is my favorite place on the
planet before we legalize.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets beautiful here.
[SPEAKER_03]: The weather is gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_03]: The climate is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: The summers are amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The food here is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Believe the sweet corn people,
you don't know what you're missing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people are great in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are pretty chill.
[SPEAKER_03]: When family comes to visit, they always
comment on how nice the drivers are.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be driving up the highway and 30
people will shift lanes all in unison to
[SPEAKER_03]: let a semi who slow up the on ramp on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the dude from New York will go,
what the fuck was that, man?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not being dicks in unison.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't it amazing?
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't have to orchestrate or
communicate or nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just all weren't dicks at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody was telling me a story about the
cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another person was in from out of state,
I think New York, somewhere upstate where
[SPEAKER_02]: they talked all crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They spoke all crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But she said, the friend that told me the
story said he was walking up and down the
[SPEAKER_02]: aisles going, I can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all is so nice here.
[SPEAKER_02]: People is so nice and we can smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just didn't believe how friendly and
polite Colorado people are.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things I see on the internet a
lot is people looking to come here and
[SPEAKER_03]: check out our legal weed scene,
worried they're going to be embarrassed
[SPEAKER_03]: and cause problems or get grief from
locals if they come here and get excited
[SPEAKER_03]: about legal weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, live it the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's paradise here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We kind of know we're the cool kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like, we know you want to hang out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, we'll let you in our group.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not exclusive.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not celebrities.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just potheads.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff was with me in line on January 1st.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you do much shopping the second time?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was my second round.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you do much?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you at the shop all day on the first?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I didn't work in the front at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw working a dispensary back in the
good old days, but on the first watching
[SPEAKER_03]: people make their first legal weed
purchase and do the I've got legal weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shuffle.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just how I think of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there walking out?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more than a strut.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more than a glide.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a bounce kind of tigger walks
like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter if it was a gram or an
ounce.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just elation and freedom.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one can take this away from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's magical.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just don't marine doubt yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: That has become a verb.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so dumb.
[SPEAKER_03]: It became a verb instantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually, I don't know if I've said
this on this show, I was the first person
[SPEAKER_02]: to buy recreational cannabis at the
Greener Side Dispensary in Pueblo,
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Pueblo County too.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Pueblo County.
[SPEAKER_02]: They claim that that dude in Pueblo West
beat me, but I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just where the news was.
[SPEAKER_03]: They did the same thing in Denver with the
vet being the first person.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the first person, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I walk out the door and there's a
camera crew sitting there and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: like, say something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And being, I've always got shit to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, my name is Rasta Jeff and I
was the first person to buy recreational
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis at the Greener Side Dispensary in
Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I screamed, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea where that video went.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on somebody's documentary somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to see where that went.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some pictures on my old phone that
went for a swim.
[SPEAKER_02]: You sent me the great, one of my best
Instagram and Twitter photos ever came,
[SPEAKER_02]: was actually taken by our good friend
Jesse, the one where the reporter is
[SPEAKER_02]: filming me and interviewing me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then our buddy Walter is standing
there looking like, that photo was taken
[SPEAKER_02]: by you actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, that was a really cool day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a memorable day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember a lot of stuff from that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I forgot a lot of stuff from that day
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was first, I bought weed first.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I came home and met up with my
buddy that I did another podcast with back
[SPEAKER_02]: in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And him and I went back out there and took
our recording devices and went and had a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit of fun out there for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by then I was already well known as
the first guy that bought pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how everybody knew already.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had only been three or four hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't a lot to talk about in that
line.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the news actually came to my house and
filmed us, Mike and I and another friend
[SPEAKER_02]: here hanging out smoking and put that on
the news.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a little overexcited with my first
legal weed purchase as just an adult.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, that was fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad that they were way more
fascinated with the dreadlocks and the dab
[SPEAKER_03]: rig than they were with the pasty white
guy in the corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took two or three dabs when the camera
crew was here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they put the tiny, shitty weak dab on
the news.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh, you could have put a real
fat dab on the news.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I remember right, they didn't even
actually put the whole dab on either,
[SPEAKER_00]: did they?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was just me blowing it out,
I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: By then the camera guy was a little lit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't his fault.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got carried away and sort of hot boxed
this room real fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a reporter, a video camera guy
and a still camera lady.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the still camera lady was talking
about how she wished she could smoke,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they drug test her.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was making sure to blow a little
smoke right in her face.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know they did a beat fucking street to
Wendy's when they left here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reporter lady, she started off next to
me asking questions like, so tell me about
[SPEAKER_02]: this, tell me about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: She finished her report from the middle of
the living room.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was gone and she was hiding by the
front door, yelling questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: She had the front door open, getting air
and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And tell me more about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see her every other week at council
meetings and she's always a real
[SPEAKER_03]: sweetheart and tries to block me out of
her shot of whoever's speaking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just by fate lines us up.
[SPEAKER_03]: If she was, if she wanted to, she could
tip her camera up a degree and a half and
[SPEAKER_03]: have my dumb mug in every background shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: But she cuts me out and I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well you've been seen as the guy
smoking bud here at the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need to be the guy on city
council also.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll look weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish they'd do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wear a lot of hats.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish they would do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's their lobbyist.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's doing well for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the one that got this important news
on the air.
[SPEAKER_03]: I cleans up real good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This whole, this all started when a
reporter from the chief and sent me an
[SPEAKER_03]: email at how he got my email.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no earthly idea, but I woke up to,
uh, can you please find us someone from
[SPEAKER_03]: the cannabis using a community that wants
to comment on the city council attempting
[SPEAKER_03]: to ban all home growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I went, wait, what?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's news to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it seems like, yeah,
the story we just told a little stone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm kind of backtracking.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to remind the people that what's
going to happen is the draft will be
[SPEAKER_02]: presented on October 15th to the city
council.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we've got to do is go to the city
council meeting on the 13th and kind of be
[SPEAKER_02]: preemptive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Show them, look, we know this is coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're here to influence you first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come up with good reasons why it's
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have, if you got a speaking
voice, if you're not scared to speak in
[SPEAKER_02]: front of people, go speak to the city
council.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a public forum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Explain to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That they can't make us grow in private
buildings because first that tells the
[SPEAKER_02]: robbers right where our weed is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second, that tells your neighbors that you
are actually growing cannabis if they
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't already know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Third, you can't afford a damn building.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four, that's going to make more
electricity for Black Hills to go wire up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That should be number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: See all these reasons already add up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second of all, what are we doing wrong?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple of people screwing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go make those people correct their things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't punish the whole group for a couple
of people screw ups.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does nothing to go over the act or
try to attack the actual criminal element
[SPEAKER_00]: that does happen from some home grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of nitpicking, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the person growing weed in their
home on the black market for sale on the
[SPEAKER_03]: black market isn't bothering to follow any
of the rules and they're doing so they're
[SPEAKER_03]: doing everything covertly because they
don't want to get caught and arrested.
[SPEAKER_03]: The people who are standing up following
the letter of the law, but being dickish
[SPEAKER_03]: about it are just bringing a black guy to
the whole community and causing everybody
[SPEAKER_03]: problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we legalize it, if enough idiots screw
up, they're going to take that away.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next president could send the fucking
Marines.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that outlandish.
[SPEAKER_02]: The vision in my head was just like,
well, remember in Boston.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't ever say that again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your outdoor garden will get droned if
we're not careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a manhunt for somebody after the
Boston Marathon bombings and they were
[SPEAKER_02]: going into every single house and
searching every single room looking for
[SPEAKER_02]: these suspects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine if they tried to do that here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That wouldn't happen in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: That only will happen on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're one of the most armed states there
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine that type of shit going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Such a bizarre state, very liberal and
very gun friendly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know anyone who grew up here that
didn't grow up shooting.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guns go well with the liberalness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you have to be able to protect
yourself being so liberal.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of places in this state
where you can fully get eaten by a bear
[SPEAKER_03]: still.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a thing here.
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 minutes from here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can be eaten by several things 30
minutes from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell, they found a moose down in the river
earlier this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the most deadly creatures in
North America.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people do not respect the moose.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does not have big fangs so they don't
get afraid of claws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch out for the knuckle part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's give a shout out to Jesse for a
moose knuckle reference on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we transition from moose knuckle to...
Let me just finish it with saying I'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: too afraid to get beat up by a nice moose
knuckle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let's go to the part you were going to
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I blush and rub my face a little I need
more weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that just kills me...
I'd like to give you a dab but on the show
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to choke for like 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me the tiniest little baby girly dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start talking while I get them ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take one first and by the time you're
done I'll have a couple dabs going.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that kills me about the
cannabis community is for the last 80
[SPEAKER_03]: years or so we've been forced underground
and into the dark and out of the way and
[SPEAKER_03]: out of sight and that's how we've survived
and that's how we've thrived.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now that it's legal more of us need to
stand the fuck up and show up to the city
[SPEAKER_03]: council and show up to vote and show up
during budget meetings and have our voices
[SPEAKER_03]: heard.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're used to hiding and pretending like
we're not part of the system and we're
[SPEAKER_03]: against the system but we live here too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's our city too.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have just as much right to have our
city be like we would like it as anyone
[SPEAKER_03]: else in the city and if nobody shows up
and speaks out against a ban on all home
[SPEAKER_03]: growing that requires you to build a
building city council's not going to care
[SPEAKER_03]: that it's ridiculous and unenforceable and
a horrible idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to go ahead and approve it
because without thinking about it just on
[SPEAKER_03]: a quick gut check it seems like you ought
to have the right to wake up in the
[SPEAKER_03]: morning and not smell marijuana and this
ordinance might do that once for somebody
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sure go ahead and approve it and if
nobody's willing to throw on some clean
[SPEAKER_03]: clothes and show up Monday night at seven
o'clock and say hey I think this is a
[SPEAKER_03]: really bad idea and I'd appreciate you not
passing this ordinance who knows what's
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean I think they're gonna kill it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that if I show up and one or two
other people show up and speak that
[SPEAKER_03]: they'll go ahead and kill it on the 15th
or next month or whatever but who knows
[SPEAKER_03]: nobody's willing to stand up and that's
part of the reason Pueblo City doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: have any medical shops in it or any rec
shops yet because so far it's just me down
[SPEAKER_03]: at city council saying we ought to have
these.
[SPEAKER_03]: For a minute we had a little cannabis
community group but they fell apart pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you don't need a group though you
just you just need to be a citizen who's
[SPEAKER_03]: willing to show up Monday night at seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's something that I've kind of
tossed around in my head when when Mike
[SPEAKER_02]: and I had a shop together it was owned by
somebody else but you know we ran that
[SPEAKER_02]: place there were a couple times we had to
go to court for a couple of things and to
[SPEAKER_02]: support a member of our group that had a
court trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also we went to a couple of city council
things to try to speak up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look like your tip.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look like a cliche freaking pothead.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an email on a mic card.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a little plastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the first time that's happened to
tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to learn how to take dabs with a mic
in front of me also.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm talking about I used to go to those
city council meetings and then I'm saying
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm six foot five with dreadlocks to my
ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude my dreadlocks go past my ass now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got four foot ropes hanging off of my
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah and there's nowhere to hide them and
even if I put on a collared shirt and I
[SPEAKER_02]: look good I've still got these Rasta Man
dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Carl Hart feels your pain sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel uh there's I'm almost a detriment
to the community when I go to city council
[SPEAKER_02]: meetings and show like look here's Rasta
Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I'm a weight on the community
when I show up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of hide because of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say that you're a self-employed
successful citizen of our beautiful city
[SPEAKER_03]: and have as much of a right to stand up
and claim your piece of it is the best
[SPEAKER_03]: dressed cleanest shaved motherfucker in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just gonna say fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to change who you are to
stand up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stand up and be part of city government.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody gets a vote.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody gets to say period.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rules of this the city council
meetings anyone who comes and signs up to
[SPEAKER_03]: speak before the meeting they usually
limit it to six but they've been allowing
[SPEAKER_03]: more than six people to speak at the
beginning of most meetings lately because
[SPEAKER_03]: of all the hubbub and the recall stuff but
if you show up to speak you can you get
[SPEAKER_03]: your five minutes as long as you're not
cussing or throwing things you can say
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever you want and there's these old
crotchety people that show up and bitch
[SPEAKER_03]: about whatever their passion issue is
every two weeks at every single meeting
[SPEAKER_03]: they take five minutes at the beginning of
the meeting to stand up and say I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: like any of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need all of you to stop right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate you but he takes five minutes to do
that at the beginning of every meeting and
[SPEAKER_03]: he sits down and his crotchety friend gets
up and does the same thing and they're not
[SPEAKER_03]: any more valid or legitimate than you with
your dreadlocks or Jesse with his beard or
[SPEAKER_03]: me with my earrings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because I clean up a little better
than y'all as far as the cops are
[SPEAKER_03]: concerned doesn't mean you deserve less or
more space in city council than I take.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only reason they talk to me is because
I show up all the time and I'm familiar
[SPEAKER_03]: face.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people leave halfway through the
meeting and then it's just the people that
[SPEAKER_03]: are stuck there playing a role in going
through the pageantry of city government
[SPEAKER_03]: and because I'm willing to hang out for
that last hour I can call city council at
[SPEAKER_03]: two o'clock in the afternoon and by eight
o'clock have talked to three of them
[SPEAKER_03]: personally for like 15 minutes each.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a fucking stoner too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just willing to stand up and claim my
little spot at the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: My other question is am I going to attract
unwanted attention to myself?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not doing anything I shouldn't be but
am I going and speaking out as a weed head
[SPEAKER_02]: looking like a weed head?
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I bringing weed head trouble to myself?
[SPEAKER_03]: The cops are too busy to give a shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: A friend of mine likes to tell a story.
[SPEAKER_03]: A girlfriend got mad at him and called the
cops and said my boyfriend's growing too
[SPEAKER_03]: much weed and the cop went weed and hung
up the phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got heroin falling off the truck
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a teen pregnancy rate that
rivals most counties high school
[SPEAKER_03]: graduation rates.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cops are busy.
[SPEAKER_03]: The kids that's going to city council with
dreadlocks and standing up saying I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: like this ordinance please don't vote for
it is not someone they need to worry
[SPEAKER_03]: about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now if you show up and throw a rock at
Sandy Daff they're probably going to pay
[SPEAKER_03]: attention to who you are and follow you
out of the building and give you a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: problems but if you stand up and act like
a citizen they will treat you like a
[SPEAKER_03]: citizen because doing so anything else is
technically a crime.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I wear a hat in the courtroom?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just tuck my dreads up in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: People show up in pajamas.
[SPEAKER_03]: The trash haulers are down there a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of them come straight from work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amina Rocky works full-time as a mail
carrier and more often than not is in her
[SPEAKER_03]: work uniform.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eva Montoya shows up in a t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nine meetings out of ten.
[SPEAKER_03]: If someone on the council is in a t-shirt
you should feel fine in a grassroots hat
[SPEAKER_03]: keeping your dreadlocks out of your face.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of us he's talking to you
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really boring.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's city government.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of people mumbling about really
hyper-specific rules and it's sort of bore
[SPEAKER_03]: yourself to tears dull but it affects your
life in a number of ways regularly and
[SPEAKER_03]: right now they're looking to kill
countless small businesses and every
[SPEAKER_03]: caregiver in the city limits with a dumb
rule trying to kill smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just wrote them a pretty nice little
sales tax check for our first quarter
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: For which business?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hygro Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hygro indoor growing supplies.
[SPEAKER_02]: How often are you at Hygro indoor growing
supplies?
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot more lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: More frequently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to derail Mike's subject here but guys
a lot of people want to talk to Jesse
[SPEAKER_02]: about growing stuff from the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Catch him at Hygro indoor growing
supplies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Distract him so that he can't get his work
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's much more fun to stand there and help
you guys out than it is to stack shit up
[SPEAKER_02]: all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you bring dabs down that's a good way
to distract me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a good thing you're the boss.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no I'm not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well we've got to say that you are if
you're taking dabs while you're working.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just above the law.
[SPEAKER_02]: So guys come to city if you live in
Pueblo, Colorado is it just city or does
[SPEAKER_02]: the county count?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're part of the county come out to
all of this stuff affects you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the city bans all home growing the
county is going to experience a massive
[SPEAKER_03]: mass exodus of cannabis caregivers into
the county and with the fit they've been
[SPEAKER_03]: pitching over one weed farm out and
whatever that road is I don't imagine
[SPEAKER_03]: they'd like the 3,000 plus caregivers that
live in Pueblo County and have since the
[SPEAKER_03]: medical marijuana program started
publishing that information about a decade
[SPEAKER_03]: ago like all these people are going to
have to pack their shit up and take it to
[SPEAKER_03]: the county and the county ain't ready to
handle that so county folks show up and
[SPEAKER_03]: say this is a terrible idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a well established caregiver.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been caregiving for five or six years
professionally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I call myself a professional caregiver.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do very well at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: My patients love my products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They count on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They rely on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have got a system designed where I can
provide exactly what they need.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know when my patients are going to call.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know when I know when my old friend I
know exactly when he's going to run out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know when everybody I've got them
scheduled to have to redo my grow to build
[SPEAKER_02]: another building would cause me to have to
leave this town which would put five
[SPEAKER_02]: people that I'm responsible for in some
deep shit with their cannabis needs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I would.
[SPEAKER_02]: And where are they going to get it because
there's not there aren't going to be any
[SPEAKER_02]: other caregivers to take my spot because
they can't grow in their indoor
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like not everybody's got a breeding
facility somewhere else to work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of us have to stick to the basement
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to mention I mean just the the loss of
revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Amendment 64 is even with Pueblo
every corner they've been able to stop
[SPEAKER_00]: being having retail stores and grows in
city limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo still prospered from Amendment 64
you know and in small ways but you know
[SPEAKER_03]: all the secondary employment that has come
from 64 Pueblo still enjoying all the
[SPEAKER_03]: electricians the plumbers the caregivers
the you know the growth store.
[SPEAKER_00]: People move in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The growth store makes a lot of money from
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I mean you can't lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse just said they wrote a nice tax
check.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish there was a higher profit margin on
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Through the last depression the one growth
store on 4th Street sprung up what three
[SPEAKER_03]: new locations and two new competitors
bloomed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pueblo ain't that big folks and we've got
four now.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are five or six hydro shops with the
driving distance of here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right and they're all surviving just fine
because there's a lot of employment
[SPEAKER_03]: bleeding off this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna do a shameless plug right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been to all of the hydro shops in
this town.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's no doubt at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of them several times and there's a
reason why I've chosen one specific shop
[SPEAKER_02]: to be my sponsor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was almost out there today just by
happenstance.
[SPEAKER_03]: I needed something and that was what
dawned on me is the place to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah we're gonna have to work out some
kind of coupon code or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the agriculture listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been thinking that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If right now just off the top if you
mentioned that you listen to the show and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're buying something tell us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll take care of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll come up with something official.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll probably only work at the Pueblo
location because Jesse's not in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah but tell him anyways and we'll get
something worked out in Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys hear that?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna get a coupon code or some sort
of deal for you guys for listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also gonna do some giveaways.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just haven't decided how to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a couple of cool items.
[SPEAKER_02]: Possibly some titanium and possibly a
t-shirt and maybe a couple of hat pins
[SPEAKER_02]: that need to be given away to listeners.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just need good ideas on how to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram and Facebook giveaways feel
cheesy.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you give them to me I'll hand them out
to anybody who talks not retarded at
[SPEAKER_03]: council.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was gonna say I'll take one to Sandy
Daff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give her an irie genetics pin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me irie shirts for all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back on the subject of the proposed
ordinance they mentioned something about
[SPEAKER_00]: landlords in there and I kind of thought
that was BS too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a couple local landlords.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them has over 30 properties and the
other one has 18 properties and some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those are big duplexes or apartment
buildings.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care they actually tell their
tenants they don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry I can't name them but they don't
care.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's golden information in this state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost all of their tenants grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost all of their tenants pay rent on
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take care of their houses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where they came up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Landlords are pissed about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because no one in the industry stands
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're on city council or if you're the
police chief or the fire chief you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: meet caregivers like you two.
[SPEAKER_03]: You meet the caregiver who set his fucking
house on fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: You meet the caregiver who got drunk at
the bar and backed into somebody's car
[SPEAKER_03]: with three pounds in the trunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody blew their garage apart open
blasting and smoking a cigarette at the
[SPEAKER_03]: same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you guys are good at what you do
and you've never blown yourself up or set
[SPEAKER_03]: your house on fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've never met you.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've never heard of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've never seen pictures of your
garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I could take pictures of your grow room
and take them to city council I could give
[SPEAKER_03]: them an idea of what it looking or what
doing it right looks like because they've
[SPEAKER_03]: only ever seen the one that the cops got
called on and the cops took pictures of.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean that's part of the problem there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you're reading high times or kush
or you're blessed like I am and you get to
[SPEAKER_03]: make friends with people like Jeff and
Jesse.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never see this.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys want pictures check out I read
genetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also check out Jesse grows on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of great pop pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah city council download Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: While you're at it follow our friend
Garden of Weedon on Instagram if you want
[SPEAKER_02]: high high quality cannabis pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you like pop porn do what he just said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah no porn.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason he just won a nice little
secret cup there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man it was good to look up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was dabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked up and suddenly Jesse was at the
secret cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no idea you were coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I just flew up real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I blinked and he was gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was literally repotting plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like fuck it I'm gonna go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was about 45 minutes to get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think your travel time was more than
what you spent there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah probably so.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the best drive time ever you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so like exciting watching him win.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just so cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again big shout out to our buddy
Spence for taking home the first place at
[SPEAKER_02]: the secret cup mountain region.
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep wishing him the best of luck in
Vegas but I'm pretty sure he's gonna bring
[SPEAKER_02]: it home for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He put this little town on the map bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah and see I mean.
[SPEAKER_03]: For something so positive too we're always
on the map for some psychotically horrid
[SPEAKER_03]: shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so nice when it's positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know another thing I just want to say
is most caregivers basements I've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a general term for where their
grow is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are way cleaner than most
dispensaries grows I've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the honest truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nine days out of 10 I'd be happy eating
off Jeff's growing floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of I've got a little bit of OCD
and that plays very well being a pot
[SPEAKER_02]: farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.
[SPEAKER_02]: It plays and you'll notice my front yard
is clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: My backyard is clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sides of my house are clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked my neighbors neighbors to remove
some debris they had over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a trailer with like old wood they
had chopped down and they didn't take it
[SPEAKER_02]: away for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like I hate to be a stickler but
could you possibly take away that wood and
[SPEAKER_02]: if you need some more reasons why I'll let
you know why it's bugging me.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like I'm sorry we'll get rid of it
and they took it because it's bugs dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need every little board.
[SPEAKER_02]: My weeds are pulled all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: My backyard garden is clean because I
can't afford the bugs that that will
[SPEAKER_02]: bring.
[SPEAKER_02]: That will bring more problems and it also
makes your house look like shit and being
[SPEAKER_02]: a pot grower I want to be a good citizen
and not make my house look like shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean that's part of the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one sees this.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one sees how wet well most of the
industry does it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of city council hasn't bothered to go
out and visit any of the legal marijuana
[SPEAKER_03]: stores in town some of which have been
open for like seven eight years now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean how long has Marisol been open and
they can't make that drive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean it's not exactly the best example I
could have thrown out but like it's been
[SPEAKER_02]: there the longest.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the first dispensary we got in
Pueblo we got to give them credit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the first and I mean you can't go out
there and check if it's something that's
[SPEAKER_03]: so scary and should be fought like
shouldn't you understand your opponent to
[SPEAKER_03]: kill it or at least some nonsense like
that and go see it once.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some Jedi shit right there bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's so scary if they see it from the
parking lot they'll have to go in and
[SPEAKER_03]: inject some marijuana's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch out they're gonna turn gay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys if you're growing indoors it will.
[SPEAKER_02]: Walk into your grow room and close your
eyes and breathe and if it smells like wet
[SPEAKER_02]: or smells like plants you're doing it
wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need more ventilation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need more air out and more fresh air
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to be able to smell that
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: In your own grow room you shouldn't be
able to smell it in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: This random grow tip has been brought to
you by Urgenetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just thinking about filtration and
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're gonna grow indoors yeah I gotta
order a couple carbon filters by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're gonna be growing indoors and
doing it right that's that's how you know
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not putting humidity and mildew
problems into the house and that's how you
[SPEAKER_02]: know you're filtering it to where your
neighbors aren't gonna complain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I blew a guy's mind the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sold him a carbon filter for the intake.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first told him about it he was like
sounds like a waste of money and within 45
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds he was like oh whoa oh wow yeah
it's like dude it even like it makes your
[SPEAKER_00]: light bulbs last longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean it's everything it's just it's
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah yeah carbon filters guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Carbon scrubbers if you're not using it to
just pull the air out of the room that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're growing in put a filter with a
blower in there just right in the middle
[SPEAKER_02]: of the room either on the floor or hanging
in the ceiling to keep the air clean and
[SPEAKER_02]: keep air moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't have too much airflow in your
grow room.
[SPEAKER_03]: You really can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Random tips from some pros today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have really good air here too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Had everyone in town taking that advice at
the beginning of the summer we would not
[SPEAKER_03]: be here recording this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a really you know I'm an outdoor
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to keep that stink away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a good suggestion.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the same time have you ever had a
neighbor?
[SPEAKER_00]: No but where I grow outdoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been in many back door or backyard
gardens back Jesus I'm stoned.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been in many backyard gardens.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got something weird on your mind?
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen a lot of pissed off
neighbors on either side generally because
[SPEAKER_03]: unless you're doing it in large quantities
or you're really good at it you're not
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna produce a level of stink that's
there for more than two weeks at any sort
[SPEAKER_03]: of obnoxious level.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean we're not talking more than like
the dog shit from the guy next door who
[SPEAKER_03]: hasn't raked it up in a couple of weeks or
the compost pile that's baking in the Sun
[SPEAKER_03]: type odor here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that strong it's just peculiar
and unless you're a real dick your
[SPEAKER_03]: neighbor's not gonna call the cops and
every member of City Council instead of
[SPEAKER_03]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're also those people that claim just
the smell of pot makes me sick I get a
[SPEAKER_02]: headache and I think that's bullshit
because I've smelled some all kinds of
[SPEAKER_02]: shit and no smells have ever really given
me a headache just smelling something
[SPEAKER_02]: probably that's but there are some people
that love to cling to a problem or a well
[SPEAKER_03]: they're like right now there's a lot of
people looking for anything about
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana to gripe about which we're
seeing a lot of out in Pueblo West right
[SPEAKER_03]: now and these folks that are sneaking out
their neighbors are really you're hurting
[SPEAKER_03]: the cause man we we succeeded and we got
full legalization and now we've got people
[SPEAKER_03]: looking to throw anchors at us and it
sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job on the stink but man turn it
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: My in-laws live in Pueblo West every
Sunday we go out there and eat dinner with
[SPEAKER_00]: them I grew up out there so well I went to
high school out there I drive around and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that take different roads every
single time I can find two or three plants
[SPEAKER_00]: sticking above the fence there's a place
out there his hoop houses he have in his
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard kind of remind me of what greener
side looks like you know I mean they're
[SPEAKER_00]: they're they're pushing it they're pushing
the limits they're being assholes and that
[SPEAKER_00]: sucks I thought about go to the mountains
thought about doing some plants in my
[SPEAKER_02]: backyard I was gonna buy one of those ten
by ten dog runs and a little greenhouse
[SPEAKER_02]: and put the greenhouse inside the dog run
but like seven out of ten growers that
[SPEAKER_02]: have grown some outdoor pot this year have
either had caterpillars or thieves in this
[SPEAKER_02]: neighborhood and I'm just gonna pass on
the outdoor one of the things most people
[SPEAKER_03]: don't take into account for the outdoor is
you're giving up like 90% of your control
[SPEAKER_03]: tuck so that you can also give up 90% of
your energy costs 99% of your control well
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah 95 yeah you would be much more
qualified to speak on this and
[SPEAKER_02]: environmentally yeah weather and you can
do weather and bugs are gonna kick your
[SPEAKER_03]: ass all summer long I mean I just grew a
bunch of veggies outdoor this year in the
[SPEAKER_03]: weather and bugs pretty much killed me but
I still got a massive harvest out to use
[SPEAKER_03]: old pot dirt to grow veggies I know a
bunch of growers that gave me two truck
[SPEAKER_03]: fulls of old pot dirt mix it with sand so
it holds water a little better I mixed it
[SPEAKER_03]: with that clay crap Pueblo was built on
yeah work like a charm folks I got
[SPEAKER_02]: zucchinis the size of Jeff he brought me
some some jalapenos some tomatoes I got a
[SPEAKER_02]: nice bag of produce one night that was
pretty nice yeah it's nice being the
[SPEAKER_02]: hippie kid in the in the group because all
my farmer friends Jesse was bringing me
[SPEAKER_02]: killer tomatoes I can't even eat a damn
tomato any now any anyway now after the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that he gave me my shirt tomatoes
are just woman my shit fucking it it
[SPEAKER_00]: totally got a second leg her second wind
yeah that's crazy I rarely eat eggs
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's kind of a dietary decision
but also because eggs are disgusting but
[SPEAKER_02]: then Jesse brought me a few eggs and I was
like let's give it a try and I cracked
[SPEAKER_02]: them open and the yolk on the inside it
looked healthy they smelled good and those
[SPEAKER_02]: eggs were tasty I fried them up and made
some my egg and I forgot what I even did
[SPEAKER_02]: but those were so good not store-bought
processed GMO shit those real eggs and
[SPEAKER_02]: that real vegetables you brought me so
good garden freshmen throw your own you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys throw your own extra links and
expense to ensure non-gmo food for my
[SPEAKER_02]: chickens nice delicious it worked well all
right guys we've gone for an hour do you

to start wrapping up the show other than
[SPEAKER_02]: come to the City Council meeting in Pueblo
Colorado October 13th I will tweet the
[SPEAKER_02]: exact address I will Facebook the exact
address so that you guys have no excuse we
[SPEAKER_02]: talked about it if you're up if you're
Chewbacca you can still come to the
[SPEAKER_02]: meeting if you don't have any hair if
you've got a lot of hair if you got long
[SPEAKER_02]: hair if you got tattoos if you got a
facial piercing if you have clean clothes
[SPEAKER_03]: that's all you got to do just put some
clothes in the wash Monday morning throw
[SPEAKER_03]: some clean clothes on after work Monday
night head on down to the City Council
[SPEAKER_03]: chambers around six o'clock the meeting
starts at seven you want to have a chance
[SPEAKER_03]: to sign up right as you walk into the City
Council chamber on the third floor there's
[SPEAKER_03]: like a little table with a couple of
sheets of paper on it and they'll have the
[SPEAKER_03]: agenda for the night and then the sign up
sheet for people that want to speak at the
[SPEAKER_03]: public forum is sign up on the public
forum sign up sheet if you want to speak
[SPEAKER_03]: and grab an agenda and find a seat I
usually sit on the right hand side of the
[SPEAKER_03]: chamber if you're looking at the City
Council over by the fire chief so we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: have the dab rig set up and no no we won't
do they do they search you on the way into
[SPEAKER_03]: this one you have to go through the metal
detector okay you just show up walk
[SPEAKER_03]: upstairs or take the elevator it's really
handicap accessible apparently they got
[SPEAKER_03]: sued a few years ago oh that sucks fuck
them it should have been so everybody can
[SPEAKER_03]: go just show up if you don't feel
comfortable talking or having people know
[SPEAKER_03]: your name just show up stand in the back
and clap when someone says something you
[SPEAKER_03]: like you know unless you're going crazy
they're not even gonna notice you they're
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna thank you for speaking and I mean
even if you're there yelling at them and
[SPEAKER_03]: telling which I've done before you can
fully pull a video of me berating City
[SPEAKER_00]: Council for dragging their feet online if
we had like 80 people show up do you think
[SPEAKER_03]: they would ever bring up a pot ordinance
again if we had 80 people show up they
[SPEAKER_03]: would do whatever we asked if we had five
people show up this ordinance would never
[SPEAKER_03]: see the light of day the public meeting
that we're asking you to attend is on the
[SPEAKER_03]: 13th it's officially being the ordinance
is officially being presented to City
[SPEAKER_03]: Council on the 15th if half a dozen of us
show up on the 13th and three or four of
[SPEAKER_03]: us stand up and speak and say we think
this is a terrible ordinance it's
[SPEAKER_03]: unenforceable it's really bad for Pueblo
there's no point don't do it and we're not
[SPEAKER_03]: psychotic about it when they present it on
the 15th it'll get killed immediately and
[SPEAKER_03]: it will never make it onto the official
agenda it will never be voted on by City
[SPEAKER_03]: Council it'll die quickly if 30 or 40 of
us show up we'll have the city overlay for
[SPEAKER_03]: the retail stores shaken out of this
Planning and Zoning Commission months
[SPEAKER_03]: earlier than we would otherwise right now
no one shows up no one stands up no one's
[SPEAKER_03]: called City Council to bitch about not
seeing this yet and so they're dragging
[SPEAKER_03]: their feet and we're not gonna see it till
after the elections in November so if
[SPEAKER_03]: you're listening to this show and you want
something else to do to help out register

[SPEAKER_02]: learning it so I'm new to Twitter Twitter
monster I am a Twitter monster I usually
[SPEAKER_02]: end the show and then come back and wrap
it up but I'm just gonna do it now because
[SPEAKER_02]: we've got it going on guys I want to ask
my listeners for one thing I need a theme
[SPEAKER_02]: song I've been playing other artists songs
and I've been playing that one reggae song
[SPEAKER_02]: you hear is a theme that I made on iTunes
it's not acceptable or on garage band
[SPEAKER_02]: sorry that's not acceptable if somebody
would make me a super cool theme about two
[SPEAKER_02]: minutes long maybe say a few key phrases I
grow culture podcast hosted by Rasta Jeff
[SPEAKER_02]: brought to you by I read genetics you know
I would make it up to you in some sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: way depending on what state you live in
how old you are we could work on a little
[SPEAKER_02]: compensation but there would definitely be
some pay in there I'm not begging I just
[SPEAKER_02]: need a theme song I'm tired of listening
to that cheesy reggae tune I made and I've
[SPEAKER_02]: been putting the show on you on YouTube
and YouTube gets mad at me for using all
[SPEAKER_02]: those other people's songs I've got their
written permission all the artists that I
[SPEAKER_02]: use I've got permission proving that to
Google's tricky exactly they don't even
[SPEAKER_02]: care if you do prove it they're like that
email doesn't mean shit to us we need a
[SPEAKER_02]: written letter from a record label with
notary and yeah sorry dude have Bono call
[SPEAKER_02]: us yeah that's the artists I'm using are
actually my friends it's like mystic roots
[SPEAKER_02]: and task rock and I've been like hey can I
use your music and like yeah of course bro
[SPEAKER_02]: so there's like you know they've said yes
but that's as far as we've gotten yeah you
[SPEAKER_02]: can't play Google that voicemail that's
right so somebody if you want to write I
[SPEAKER_02]: like reggae obviously if you wanted to
write a couple of them that'd be badass
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe one for the start of the show one
for the end of the show maybe a short
[SPEAKER_02]: piece for like between segments something
with a real aggressive dancehall reggae
[SPEAKER_02]: beat would be pretty smooth I don't know
I'm just begging at this point I could use
[SPEAKER_00]: a theme song that's what I'm trying to get
at he also likes death metal he's a big
[SPEAKER_03]: slayer fan so anything with there's
nothing like getting real high just
[SPEAKER_02]: listening to a thousand please don't do
that don't waste your energy we'll play
[SPEAKER_02]: when Jesse comes on we like and Jesse
don't do that don't do that I like reggae
[SPEAKER_02]: I like some funky shit I'm a huge fish
Grateful Dead kind of guy so you know I
[SPEAKER_02]: grow culture podcast needs a theme song
and you'll be compensated in some way or
[SPEAKER_00]: another if you're in Colorado I'll get
high with you I'll definitely hook you up
[SPEAKER_02]: with some seeds if you're in Colorado I
just have to make sure you're 21 and in
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado I can't do that if you're outside
of Colorado if you come to Colorado I'll
[SPEAKER_03]: get you seeds I got you and one of my
favorite things to wear around town is my
[SPEAKER_03]: iry pin and you can wear the fuck out of
that in Pennsylvania or New York or any
[SPEAKER_02]: other state that sucks out loud and you
could also probably get an iry genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: t-shirt if I have your size and some
stickers and a pan we'll make it worth it
[SPEAKER_02]: trust me right there's other stuff too
I've got prizes prize gags could be built
[SPEAKER_00]: that's right some I go culture t-shirts
