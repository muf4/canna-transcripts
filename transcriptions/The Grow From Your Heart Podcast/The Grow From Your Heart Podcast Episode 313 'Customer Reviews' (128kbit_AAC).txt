[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what up, cannabis community?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 313 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name's Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the podcast is brought to
you by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new genetics for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find them at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you want to know what's going on
in your grow room when you're not there,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you want to know what the temperature
and humidity of your grow room are right
[SPEAKER_00]: now, you'd be able to find out by looking
at your phone and logging in to your
[SPEAKER_00]: reminder unit from PL Grow Systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check them out at plgrow
.systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, you guys, I like to start these
episodes off by letting you know what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dads of Papaya
Punch number four from Olio, and this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm cracking open the jar right now to get
a fresh smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like a juicy papaya.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like grape sweet tarts,
like the purple sweet tarts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like they're right in your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells juicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of mouthwatering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is perfect visually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really light golden color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's lighter than honey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is kind of a bright yellow color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got just the right amount of crystals
to just the right amount of sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am impressed and in love with the Papaya
Punch number four sauce from those great
[SPEAKER_00]: folks over at Olio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, you guys, next thing I want to do
is read some iTunes ratings and reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are customer reviews from iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were listening to the podcast on
iTunes, and you'd like to leave a review,
[SPEAKER_00]: simply open up the podcast on your phone,
and just scroll down past the available
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes, and then you will see the
ratings and reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to leave a review,
all you have to do is click on,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's see, where does it go?
[SPEAKER_00]: You scroll down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says available episodes as previously
played.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it shows the reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right there in the middle says write a
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you've got to do is click on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you the option to give me the
amount of stars you think I deserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can give me up to five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, 116 people have given the show a
five-star review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me as many stars as you feel I
deserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a little title.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then type in a customer review,
and I will read your review on a future
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so I'm going to scroll down and
get to the most recent customer reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, this first review I want to read
was left on March 15th by a person who
[SPEAKER_00]: calls themselves Clash Cobra.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I said that correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline is Amazing Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave me a five-star review,
and it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Changing the world one show at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I may have read that review
before, but that was a good one,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it was worth reading again if I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess the first thing I should say is
thanks for having fun and learning with
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you find me fun, and I'm glad
that you're learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was exactly my goal, so thanks a lot
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then thanks for saying that I'm
changing the world one show at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not realize the magnitude of what
I'm doing, and I try not to think about
[SPEAKER_00]: how big that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just try to stay humble and not think
about that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does mean a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for the great compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the great customer review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, thanks for the five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get my iPad to open up the
next review.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from a person who calls themselves
Sweet Chick Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was left on May 29th.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline is Very Influential.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's informational, then the review
goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great information and delivered very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, thank you, because that's
exactly what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to give you great information,
and I'm trying to deliver it in a way that
[SPEAKER_00]: sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got good equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want this to sound well-produced,
and I want to speak mostly clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know sometimes I get carried away,
and I've got my own personality,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I speak the way I speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I try to be clear, and I try to
enunciate, and I try to give clear
[SPEAKER_00]: instructions and explain things well,
and I try to explain things in different
[SPEAKER_00]: ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that different thought processes can
absorb what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for noticing that it's delivered
very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work hard at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the review, and thank you
for the five stars, and thanks for
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next review was left on April 9th,
and it was left by a person who calls
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves Desiree Peralta One.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Desiree Peralta.
[SPEAKER_00]: Desiree says, I'm not even a grower,
but this is still one of my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff is well-spoken and
entertaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 out of 10 would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I got two bonus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bonus would recommend out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only supposed to go to 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: She gave me 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: I must be nailing it for Desiree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the huge compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, thank you for a five-star
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is super kind of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next review comes from a listener who
calls themselves Daryl Strawberry Jr. I
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like I may have read some of Daryl
Strawberry Jr.'s reviews before,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this one goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline says, the Lemon G of
podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are a cannabis consumer in
Colorado, that's a huge compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means I stand out and I'm terpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the review goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great information, and Jeff keeps it very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for freely contributing to the
community in an unbiased manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do try to keep it interesting,
and I try to do have great information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm nailing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for noticing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you point out that I'm freely
contributing to the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, this is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not charge anything for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a Patreon campaign that if
people would like to contribute to,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is free for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want everybody to grow the best cannabis
that they could possibly produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have all of the gear,
the best seeds, the best nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: All they need is some good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for noticing that I'm doing that
for the community for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, in an unbiased manner, I do have my
own opinions and feelings and my ideas of
[SPEAKER_00]: certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just try to keep a lot of that out of
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: My opinion of a lot of things doesn't
matter to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to make your garden better?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to make your life easier?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to help you increase your
yields or improve your potency or help you
[SPEAKER_00]: medicate yourself more properly?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you want to hear from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to hear about my crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to keep it unbiased.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do have an opinion on something that
is going to affect the cannabis community,
[SPEAKER_00]: I do try to share that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I try not to be biased.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to have an open mind and an open
heart in everything I do, because when you
[SPEAKER_00]: close your mind and you close your heart,
you can't learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to deliver content in an unbiased
manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to put too much of my own
personal stuff into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen to the show a lot,
you'll know I am biased.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm biased against auto flower seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first started doing the show 313
episodes about four years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't like, support, endorse or care
for auto flowers at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since I kept an open mind and I
listened to people, now I kind of find the
[SPEAKER_00]: acceptable use, the spot for that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was biased and I just had to learn
how to kind of keep some of that out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you watch my Instagram live videos,
that's where you'll get more of my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinions and my feelings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't feel like that's what a lot
of you are here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do start the podcast off by talking
about my life sometimes, but I try not to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring too many of my beliefs or my
political ideas or too much of that kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or brand loyalty, I try not to bring too
much of that to this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, business is business and I'm a
human.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things are gonna come through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without my personality, this podcast
wouldn't be this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got to put myself into it,
but thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for noticing that I try to stay
fair and unbiased.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to form opinions on new ideas,
new products, new methods or techniques
[SPEAKER_00]: until I've actually had time to research
it and look at what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to keep an open mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for noticing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last line of this customer review
says, Jeff is solely responsible for 36.4
[SPEAKER_00]: of all hugs given to moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be responsible for one third of all
of the hugs given to moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have definitely been blamed for a lot
worse things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that I can add to my
resume, responsible for one third or 36.4%
[SPEAKER_00]: of all hugs given to moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I claim that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that something I can put on a resume?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I put that on my Facebook profile?
[SPEAKER_00]: I might add that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Daryl Strawberry Jr. Is it Daryl
Strawberry Jr.?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daryl Strawberry Jr., thanks for the great
customer review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the five stars and thanks for
listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, the great reviews keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, I can't read the full headline,
but it says good dot dot dot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was left by a person who calls
themselves Frankie 456.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, they gave me a five star review
and the customer review goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to this podcast every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been putting out two episodes,
so I hope you're listening to both of them
[SPEAKER_00]: and I hope you're hearing the Thursday
episodes because that's where you got a
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Frankie 456, big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening to the show and
thanks for the customer review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, dude, thanks for listening every
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're welcome, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next review, the headline is great
vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was left only 14 hours ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was left by a person who calls
themselves madcapv2.
[SPEAKER_00]: The customer review goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been listening for about a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would enjoy more strain reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really makes my Monday morning drives a
lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks for listening for the past
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you love the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strain reviews, what they're talking
about is I have done strain specific
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes where I talk about strains that I
have bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done the morning dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did firefly and we did the cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels a little weird sitting here for
30 minutes talking about my own strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels a little egotistical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since you guys are asking for more,
that means I've got to deliver more of
[SPEAKER_00]: those to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So madcapv2, look forward to more of those
episodes coming in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks for the great customer review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, thanks for the five star
rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you titled that customer review
great vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot for thinking I've got a great
vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vibes are important to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I've got one more
customer review that I would like to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was left just 12 hours ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was left by a person who calls
themselves Red House Gros.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline is awesome podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, they left a five star rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the customer review goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently at episode 250 and catching all
the way up at four to 12 hours a day of
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to your show and the Dude Gros
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, shout out to my friends at the Dude
Gros.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not listening to the Dude Gros
show, make sure you check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The review keeps going.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, keeps my sanity at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for that, I thank you, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Signed Red House Gros.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Red House Gros, I'm glad I'm keeping
you sane, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I hope you're gonna be okay when you
catch up to all the episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're listening to four to 12 hours a
day, you're gonna be caught up really
[SPEAKER_00]: soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Throwback Thursday episodes end at
2.82, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are gonna get caught up really
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means I'm gonna have to start
stepping it up and putting out more
[SPEAKER_00]: content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully between the Dude and Scotty and
myself, we can keep your head right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Red House Gros, seriously,
thank you for the great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for the five star rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep listening, my friend, and I will keep
putting out great content for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, that is all of the iTunes
customer reviews for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna thank everybody who's left an
iTunes customer review, whether it was
[SPEAKER_00]: this batch that I just read or from the
past, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would appreciate it if you're
listening on iTunes, if you go and leave
[SPEAKER_00]: me a customer rating and review.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that does is it makes more people see
my show in iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more people that see the show,
the more people listen, the more people
[SPEAKER_00]: that are listening, the more people we
have on our side helping us legalize
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, the more educated soldiers we've
got on the army, then that also means
[SPEAKER_00]: there are more people out there growing
better cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So leave me a customer rating and review.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll move us up in the rankings in
iTunes and more people will listen to the
[SPEAKER_00]: show and I would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I promised that I had
some emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start right at the start of the
pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, I don't know if they want their
name said, it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great Thursday quickie about
adapting with the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't know what that's from,
he's referring to an episode I did a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of weeks ago about having to adjust
and adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you're gonna have to change your
plans on the fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes things are gonna change in the
grow and you're going to have to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention and adjust and adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for enjoying that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email continues with, I was going to
send an email to ask what I should do to
[SPEAKER_00]: make my grow run perfectly with the new
Arise and cream seeds that I just popped,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this podcast was right on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great job, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the good work and let's get you on
the Joe Rogan podcast one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, when I read that, I got intimidated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to go on the Joe Rogan
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what I would talk about for
three hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure I'd come up with something,
but sure, let's do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I could actually live out one of
these weird scenarios I've been playing in
[SPEAKER_00]: my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I haven't eaten meat in about 18
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a vegetarian since around the
year 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be time for me to start eating meat
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could explain, but just, I'm getting
skinny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting older and I'm getting
skinnier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need more energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to build instead of shrinking and
I'm approaching 40, so it may be time to
[SPEAKER_00]: add meat back into my diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a vegetarian for a lot of
reasons for a long time and it may be
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not ready to go to the store and buy
myself a steak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely not going to go to some
shitty restaurant and get a half ass piece
[SPEAKER_00]: of meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would do is I would eat some of the
elk harvested by Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I respect and trust the way that Joe Rogan
harvests his meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know he does it ethically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know he does it respectfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know he does it responsibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If Rogan were to take down an elk and send
me, he may have to cook it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He may have to precook it for me,
put it in his Yeti cooler, do his fancy
[SPEAKER_00]: cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then send it to me and give me
specific instructions on how to reheat
[SPEAKER_00]: that shit properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe I could have one of my friends
come over and they can show me how to
[SPEAKER_00]: remind me how to cook meat since I haven't
done that since the year 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if Rogan sent me an elk steak that was
prepared and all I had to do was warm it
[SPEAKER_00]: up, or if he sent me an elk steak that all
I had to do was cook it and he taught me
[SPEAKER_00]: how to cook it, you guys, I would
definitely take a couple of fat bites and
[SPEAKER_00]: chew it up and swallow it and give it like
10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And see how I feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't kill me, I'll probably eat
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it kills me, I'm obviously not gonna
eat more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what I would like to do on the
Joe Rogan podcast if I were on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also talk about cannabis, also pitch my
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's kind of a weird scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a bucket list thing, because it's
not something that I have to eat elk with
[SPEAKER_00]: Rogan.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's an opportunity that I would take
if it were available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I keep kind of, I've tweeted it and
I've had a couple other people tweet about
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe just maybe now that I've said it
on the show, maybe that will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Rogan, Mr. Joe Rogan, I fully respect
you and I love the way that you hunt and
[SPEAKER_00]: represent hunters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a vegetarian for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: My body is indicating that it may be time
to add some animal protein back into my
[SPEAKER_00]: diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Powerful Joe Rogan, it would be an honor
if I could break my nearly 20 year streak
[SPEAKER_00]: of being a vegetarian by consuming some of
your fine elk steaks, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I put that out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe Joe Rogan will hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm kind of on the spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if this does come up, you guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's keep going with this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of got off on a rant there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one more line left in this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, that way the whole world can tune
in to your expertise for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that would be awesome to get myself
on the Joe Rogan experience, because he
[SPEAKER_00]: does say some things about cannabis that
sometimes I'm like, dude, you need an
[SPEAKER_00]: expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need somebody to clear that up,
because you just said some weird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to be that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, tweet Joe Rogan and tell him
that Rasta Jeff hasn't eaten meat in 20
[SPEAKER_00]: years, and that the only way I'm going to
break my streak is if Rogan either
[SPEAKER_00]: prepares and sends me some meat or just
sends me some meat with specific
[SPEAKER_00]: instructions on how to prepare it for
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this could be a fun adventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm not sure if you want your
name said in this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, hey dude, thanks for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you would like to send me an
email, my email address is
[SPEAKER_00]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you also.
