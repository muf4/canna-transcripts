[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Podcast World?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 467 of the Grow
From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new, regular, feminized,
or auto flower seeds in your garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend Seeds Here Now,
and you can find them at www.seedsherenow
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of secret
kush mince live batter from our friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of secret cookie and kush
mince.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label says the flavor should taste
like oatmeal, raisin, and sugar cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when I dab this, it absolutely
tastes like a little Debbie oatmeal cream
[SPEAKER_00]: pie, and I fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This concentrate tastes delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a really nice, heavy buzz to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sits me back in my chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me want to chill out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of makes me feel heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's heavy and lazy, and I really enjoy
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It slows me down, and most of the time,
I'm going a little bit too fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really dig the secret kush mince live
batter from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency label says 68.83% THC and zero
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor and the buzz are where it's at
with this concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friends at Green Dot
Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to read a
couple of listener emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give you an update on the PL
Grow Minder unit that we sent to our
[SPEAKER_00]: friend up in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let's do some shout
outs to a few of our friends on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with ladies first.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big giant Grow From Your Heart
podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friend, Miss Mel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a big Grow From Your Heart
podcast shout out and a thank you to our
[SPEAKER_00]: friends at Hogan's Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a big shout out and a thank you to
Bafsta.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last, but certainly not least,
I want to send a giant Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_00]: Heart podcast thank you shout out to my
friend Aldridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to each and every one of you for
supporting the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if anybody out there would like to
learn how to become a patron and support
[SPEAKER_00]: the show on Patreon, you can do so by
visiting www.patreon.com slash Grow From
[SPEAKER_00]: Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I feel like I've gotten all of
the business handled here at the start of
[SPEAKER_00]: the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to the fun part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into the email portion of this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I read the email, let me give you a
short update.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several episodes back, I read an email
from a listener who was having technical
[SPEAKER_00]: difficulties with his monitoring
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This listener had three different
hygrometers and thermometers in his grow
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and all three of them were
giving him different readings.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a responsible gardener, my friend
wanted to know what was happening in his
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he sent me an email asking for guidance
on how to diagnose the problem and also
[SPEAKER_00]: how to correct the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as I read the email, I knew that our
friend needed a high quality monitoring
[SPEAKER_00]: device for his grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to assume that the three
devices he purchased were probably
[SPEAKER_00]: something from a garden supply store and
they did not need to be super critical on
[SPEAKER_00]: accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are using your store bought
thermometer just to pay attention to how
[SPEAKER_00]: hot it is in the house or how hot it is
outside, if it is just three to five
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees off, it won't cause any problems
other than maybe it's annoying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may say, hey, how hot is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you look and you say it's 84 degrees
and you just go, oh, that's hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really all people use thermometers
for in most scenarios.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look outside, you see it's sunshiny
outside, you put your hand over your eyes
[SPEAKER_00]: and squint a little bit so you can see
that thermometer out there on the pole by
[SPEAKER_00]: the bird feeder and you go, oh,
it's fucking 97 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right, it's hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just use it to verify what we already
assumed most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those things you're buying at the store
don't have to be dialed in super
[SPEAKER_00]: precisely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am going to assume that the three
units that were originally purchased were
[SPEAKER_00]: probably from a hardware store or a small
grow supply store or probably from the
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening center in a chain hardware store
that is most often where people are
[SPEAKER_00]: shopping these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those devices were not meant for that
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that I had the correct device for
this application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friends at PL Grow make a unit called
the minder unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what the PL Grow minder unit does is
it monitors temperature and it also
[SPEAKER_00]: monitors humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as it is monitoring those two things,
it does an equation and it instantly tells
[SPEAKER_00]: you the vapor pressure deficit in that
grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also is monitoring the temperature of
the water in your reservoir if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: that set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also measure a couple of other
things depending on parameters you select.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I knew that we could use it to monitor
the temperature and humidity in our
[SPEAKER_00]: friends grow and we could get rid of those
three useless devices which were causing
[SPEAKER_00]: him problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I was reading the email,
it dawned on me that our friends at PL
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow gave me a couple of minder units to
give away as prizes to people who listen
[SPEAKER_00]: to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I was reading the email, I thought this
person needs a PL Grow minder unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was kind enough to ask for his
address and I mailed him a PL Grow minder
[SPEAKER_00]: unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The joke is on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I had to ship that bad dog to
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hey, it made it and that's all that
matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friend has a PL Grow minder unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He set up the unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: In just a very few minutes, he was able to
log in on his phone and look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental conditions in his grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now he can monitor that grow room at
all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got an email from our friend with
an update on how life is going now that he
[SPEAKER_00]: has received the PL Grow minder unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am going to press pause for a moment
and I need a quick drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll probably take like eight dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll take another drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I get back, I'm going to read the
email from our friend St. Stephen about
[SPEAKER_00]: his new PL Grow minder unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a dab with me, boys and girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am well medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am well hydrated and I am ready to jump
into this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This chain of emails starts off with a
photo of our buddy St. Stephen,
[SPEAKER_00]: impatiently staring out the window,
waiting for the UPS truck to deliver that
[SPEAKER_00]: brand new PL Grow unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next email is a photo of our
buddy St. Stephen with a big old smile on
[SPEAKER_00]: his face and he is holding the brand new
PL Grow minder unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has arrived.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email that came along with this
wonderful photo goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dear Rasta Jeff, my PL Grow minder unit
has finally arrived.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that took a long time to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I sent that several days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had to make it through the Canadian
post.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it had to get to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it sat at customs for a
couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the unit has arrived.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, thanks so much for getting this
sent out to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have charged and registered it and I am
now getting accurate temperature and
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity levels in my room and in my
reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like he was able to get the
unit set up with no trouble at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had to charge it up and then you have
to connect it to the website and register
[SPEAKER_00]: it, create your login information and then
you are pretty much ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like he got through the
registration.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's all set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I will keep you posted as time
goes by.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot wait to hear what was actually
happening in that room compared to what
[SPEAKER_00]: you thought was happening in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also look forward to photos of the
improved garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes on to say, I have one thing I
would like to share with all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: listeners in the Northern Hemisphere who
may have heat and humidity issues in their
[SPEAKER_00]: gross spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of my Canadian friends,
this is a message from our friend St.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stephen to all of you up there in the
North.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Air conditioners are super cheap
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got a beautiful four in one unit at
a big box store.
[SPEAKER_00]: They needed to get rid of a bunch of
pre-opened boxes that had been marked down
[SPEAKER_00]: three times and I picked it up at 25% of
the listed price.
[SPEAKER_00]: The unit heats, cools, dehumidifies and
air conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can change settings via wifi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that I have a minder unit,
I am 100% dialed in and adjusting my grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room, humidity and temperature from work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friend St. Stephen has combined his
PL grow minder unit along with a air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioner dehumidifier heater unit that
also runs on wifi and he is controlling
[SPEAKER_00]: and dialing in his grow room environment
from the office at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't have to leave work.
[SPEAKER_00]: He probably looks like he is accomplishing
work tasks while he is actually dialing in
[SPEAKER_00]: this grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is a good scenario that could
possibly happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today in Colorado was unusually cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today was the first cool day that we've
had in quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been really hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I thought I might get out the hoodie
and wear some long sleeves.
[SPEAKER_00]: My personal grow space is set up for the
summer type environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an air conditioner, I've got a
dehumidifier and I am working to keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity out and keep the temperature down
because outside it has been 105 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the temperature drops, it tends to
also lower the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the humidity got lower outside today
than it has in the past few months.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives me the opportunity to reduce
the humidity in my grow room a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: too low because I am not competing with
the heat from the outside so the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: my equipment is set to expect it to be hot
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I may be actually disrupting the
ideal environment in my grow space because
[SPEAKER_00]: my equipment is not properly dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on the coast, you're gonna say,
what are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't have to worry about this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in Colorado, we have drastic
temperature and environmental changes
[SPEAKER_00]: through the seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to start getting 60 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to become 50 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before too long, it will be 30 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then eventually I will have 10 degrees,
maybe in the zeros, maybe negative
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures toward January and February.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to start adjusting my grow room
for the winter conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm getting off track, but what I'm
heading for is since today we had a
[SPEAKER_00]: weather anomaly, if I were unable to get
to the grow space, I could simply open up
[SPEAKER_00]: my phone log into my PL Grow Minder unit
and I can see what is happening in my grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: By quickly looking at my PL Grow Minder
unit chart, I can see that the temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: is just right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see that the humidity is just right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see that the VPD is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see that the water in my reservoir
is the right temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when my pump comes on to water my
plants, they don't get water that is too
[SPEAKER_00]: hot or too cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can simply log in to my PL Grow
Minder unit and assure myself that just
[SPEAKER_00]: because it got a little bit cold outside,
it has not gotten cold and dry inside my
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can ease my paranoia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can put my phone back in my pocket and I
can go back to focusing on whatever task I
[SPEAKER_00]: was trying to accomplish at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a great example of how to
utilize the PL Grow Minder unit and why
[SPEAKER_00]: the unit is so helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check on your grow from work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check on your grow from across the
planet as long as you have got a Wi-Fi
[SPEAKER_00]: connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now our friend St. Stephen has taken it a
step further.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has also put his equipment on a Wi-Fi
controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if he does notice that that PL Grow
Minder unit says, hey, it's too hot in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, he can go to his phone and he can
open up whatever application it is that
[SPEAKER_00]: runs that air conditioner and he can say,
kick on the air conditioner and it'll kick
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he can watch the PL Grow Minder unit
in real time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once that air conditioner gets that
temperature down where he wants it,
[SPEAKER_00]: he can either have it programmed in the
application to turn off the air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioner or he can watch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pay attention to that PL Minder unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch the chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch the graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch it go down, down, down, down,
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it hits the temperature he wants,
just go to the other application,
[SPEAKER_00]: turn off the air conditioner and now the
grow room has been saved.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no temperature issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no humidity issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: There won't be any problems and everybody
will have a successful harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a great advantage and a great
use of the PL Grow Minder unit combined
[SPEAKER_00]: with other internet Wi-Fi activated
devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a great way to monitor and
control your grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is more to this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get myself back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, at any rate, I wanted to share
that these air conditioner, heater,
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidifier units are being given away
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the first time, I am not sweating
bullets in here, even though it's 80
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees and humid outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at a very discounted rate, our buddy
found himself a high quality, super
[SPEAKER_00]: functional air conditioner, dehumidifier
and a heater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has finally got his grow room
dialed in and we know it's right because
[SPEAKER_00]: he is using his PL Grow Minder unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He ends this message by saying,
thanks again, I will keep you posted.
[SPEAKER_00]: He signs it with St. Stephen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then just a couple of days later,
I got another message and it says,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Minder unit is better than you
described.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I had a good idea what was
happening in my grow room before,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is clear now that I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, the PL Grow Minder unit monitors
what is happening 24 hours a day and you
[SPEAKER_00]: will be surprised to find what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: For an hour after your lights go off or an
hour after your lights come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't think that most growers are
aware of what is happening in the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room when the lights go off and when the
lights go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are drastic humidity and temperature
swings occurring in your grow room that
[SPEAKER_00]: you are completely unaware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I highly recommend a PL Grow Minder
unit in your environment so that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: identify these temperature and vapor
pressure deficit swings and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: correct them before they cause problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if you don't have problems,
you can correct them and possibly most
[SPEAKER_00]: likely improve the overall quality of your
final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our buddy St. Stephen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad the PL Grow Minder unit made it
to you safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am delighted to hear that it is helping
you dial in the grow room and it is extra
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome of you to share the fact that
there are impressive air conditioning
[SPEAKER_00]: units on sale for 25% of the regular price
at the big box stores up there in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, if you are going to
get yourself a PL Grow Minder unit,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can grab them at plgrow.systems and
while you're there, make sure you use
[SPEAKER_00]: coupon code GFYH25 and you will get 25%
off of your order at plgrow.systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to send a huge shout out to
Peter and Lee at P&L Grow Systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great guys, good friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all of the podcast support
and for all of the support with the PL
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow Minder units.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, big shout out to our buddy St.
Stephen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am glad I was able to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like I did a great job by
selecting the perfect person for this
[SPEAKER_00]: unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please keep the updates coming and have
fun in your garden, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to hearing from you in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world, I have a lot
more stuff to get through, so let's jump
[SPEAKER_00]: right into the next email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dear Rasta Jeff, I've been wondering for a
while now how trichome ripeness and what
[SPEAKER_00]: we should look for has changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: With flour that is to be dried and smoked,
generally you'd want to see all milky and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a few amber trichomes here and there
before harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with fresh frozen and washing,
it seems the earlier the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me kind of back up and touch on a
few things that are a few things I should
[SPEAKER_00]: explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person is asking about when to
harvest their cannabis plants based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: ripeness of the trichomes, but more
specifically, when to harvest for specific
[SPEAKER_00]: uses of those flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are correct in saying that when we
are harvesting our flowers that are
[SPEAKER_00]: intended to be consumed as a dried and
cured flower, we do want to let the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes ripen a little bit more than if
we were going to harvest those plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: use them for a compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concentrate in most times a flower that is
going to be smoked by itself as a raw
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, ground up, rolled into a joint,
stuffed into a bowl, put into a vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, that is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We generally harvest those plants when the
trichomes start showing about 15 to 30
[SPEAKER_00]: percent amber trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is kind of personal preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also strain dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the time we want somewhere
between 15 to 30 percent amber trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trichomes are the only part of the plant
that indicate ripeness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let people teach you any other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trichomes are where all of the
cannabinoids are produced in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where all of the cannabinoids are
held in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we harvest and we dry and cure,
we are trying to get the ripest trichomes
[SPEAKER_00]: we can achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we are harvesting for a plant to
be consumed as a flower, we generally aim
[SPEAKER_00]: for 15 to 30 percent amber trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those trichomes will continue to ripen
over time after harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will take the plants a little
bit earlier because they are familiar with
[SPEAKER_00]: the phenotype and they prefer the head
buzz that comes with an earlier harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or some people will let the plants go a
little bit longer and let the trichomes
[SPEAKER_00]: get a little more amber because they
prefer that later harvest buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that comes from developing a
relationship with that cultivar and having
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple harvests to experience the buzz
that comes from a different harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: window.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we are harvesting to make
concentrates, it does make sense to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest early.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of reasons why this
makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first reason is the trichomes have not
begun to degrade and change colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are still going to get a nice clear
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in this market, appearance means a lot
when it comes to concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a nice clear trichome will make a nice
clear concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there are many methods and
techniques to clean up a concentrate these
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't have to clean it up,
that saves you a step.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're already a step ahead of the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now another reason we can harvest our
plants a little bit earlier if we intend
[SPEAKER_00]: to make concentrates is that those
trichomes will continue to degrade through
[SPEAKER_00]: the extraction process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to beat the shit out of the
trichomes and those trichomes will
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to convert into other compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freezing the material will change the
compounds in the trichome head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Processing the material is going to change
the compounds in the trichome head.
[SPEAKER_00]: The oxidation that occurs will change the
compounds inside the trichome head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by taking that plant down a little bit
early, we still give ourselves a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of opportunity for those trichomes to
convert into the later cannabinoids that
[SPEAKER_00]: come down the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to cause that to happen
through heat and through processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does make sense to harvest your
plants which intend to be used for
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates a little bit earlier than you
would a plant that is intended to be
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked as a raw bud flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm going to jump back into the
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, we used to believe that the point
at which we harvested the trichomes
[SPEAKER_00]: affected the type of high you would
receive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find that to be a myth now that we
have better understanding of cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: and terpenes, especially pulling plants
down earlier and getting great effects
[SPEAKER_00]: from the washed and pressed product?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the podcast and I appreciate the
help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to say my name and I hope all is
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't sign your name bro,
so I don't know what your name is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But big shout out and thank you for the
great email and all is iry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk more about the question that
you asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I believe that harvesting a plant
earlier or later will affect the high?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely it will because the trichomes
have done different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Precursors have not turned into the later
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is definitely the option for a
different buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have different compounds
available or maybe those compounds have
[SPEAKER_00]: expired.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you were going to experience a
different high from that flower or from
[SPEAKER_00]: that concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do not think it is a myth that you
get a different buzz from different
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest times.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is absolutely accurate because you
were receiving different compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we let the plants go a little
longer or a little later.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they show ripeness or they
don't show ripeness because it is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: a different compound in the trichome head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the follow up question is,
do I still believe this, especially with
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling plants down earlier and getting
great effects from the washed and pressed
[SPEAKER_00]: products?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that you can get great products
from plants that were harvested a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit early, especially if you were washing
or pressing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also that product may be better for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be your preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be other people out there with
different preferences, different medical
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, different needs for their
medicine, and they may prefer the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that actually went a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only way I think you can really
determine what is best for you is if you
[SPEAKER_00]: grew the same plant and you cut it down at
week seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you grew the same plant and you cut
that one down at week eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you grew the same plant and you cut
it down at week nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same grow room, same nutrients,
same environment, same everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just harvest the plants one week apart and
stagger it so we've got three different
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to do this experiment with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then do your normal extraction process.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cut it down and freeze it
immediately and then run it however you
[SPEAKER_00]: run it, do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do that to all three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then let's check out the finished
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start our day with a big fat rip of
that product while we're fresh and sober.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wake up, have a little snack, get your day
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you're ready to smoke,
start your day with that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start with the one you chopped down on
week seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how we feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take some notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it psychedelic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you get all giggly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you forget where your keys are?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you forget what you're doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or did you get fucking paranoid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or did you want to take a nap?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you get the giggles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you want to watch cartoons?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you get the munchies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Write all of that shit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then tomorrow, let's repeat the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get up, get the day started,
have a little snack, get the blood
[SPEAKER_00]: flowing, get some air in your lungs,
get your life going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that first rip you want to take
of the day, let's smoke some of that
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate we made from the plant we cut
down at week eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's take the same notes on that
plant as we did on the week seven plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you get giggly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you get paranoid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you get the munchies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it make your eyes real red?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it make you hear a weird ringing
noise?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it make you want to take a nap?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have to poop?
[SPEAKER_00]: What did it do?
[SPEAKER_00]: What were the effects of that concentrate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then tomorrow, let's repeat the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wake up nice and fresh, have breakfast,
have a little snack, whatever you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch some cartoons, get the day moving,
get some blood flowing, get some air in
[SPEAKER_00]: your lungs, get the brain started.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's time to smoke, let's get down on
the plant that we cut down on week nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, take all kinds of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: By this smoke, you're going to know which
one you prefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it week seven, week eight,
or week nine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what you also may notice is that you
may like the one that was cut down at week
[SPEAKER_00]: seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: What may be really weird is that your
buddy really likes the one from week nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the best part of that is all three of
those concentrates are quality
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are all acceptable by consumers and
connoisseurs worldwide, but for some
[SPEAKER_00]: reason, the week seven is better for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The week nine is better for your buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all about our personal preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about our physical makeup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all about our body chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all about, I don't know what it
could be about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be your blood type.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be your brain type.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be your level of whatever that
that certain one works best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall, yes, I do agree that I would
prefer to cut down flowers that are
[SPEAKER_00]: intended to be used as a concentrate a
little bit earlier than a flower that is
[SPEAKER_00]: intended to be smoked as a raw bud or a
flower, but I do not find it to be a myth
[SPEAKER_00]: that harvesting our plants at different
times will create a different effect for
[SPEAKER_00]: the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we will find that in a raw flower,
and I think we will also find that in any
[SPEAKER_00]: type of concentrates, whether it be a
fresh frozen concentrate, whether it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: pressed or a washed product, or even the
same with a BHO extracted concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you will notice a difference in
different harvest windows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now again, what individual consumers are
going to prefer will be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will be consumer based.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to be blood type,
body type, body chemistry, brain
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, what does that consumer prefer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they want to go up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they want to go down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they want to go sideways?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all about the product and the
consumer having that connection and that
[SPEAKER_00]: symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do not find it to be a myth that we
can get a different effect through
[SPEAKER_00]: different harvest windows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually find that to be very true,
and I actually have science that can back
[SPEAKER_00]: that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really quickly, the science would be like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cut down the plants early,
there are different compounds available
[SPEAKER_00]: than if we cut down the plants later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why wouldn't those different compounds
affect a consumer in a different way?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really quick way to wrap that
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to give a big thank you to our
friend who says I can say his name,
[SPEAKER_00]: but did not include his name in the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I got to clear up what you thought
was a myth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I got to give you some good
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is a good idea to cut those plants
down early if you intend to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you're going to smoke a raw
flower, give it time, let it finish,
[SPEAKER_00]: and don't cut it down until those
trichomes tell you that the plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world, that message
took me a little longer than anticipated,
