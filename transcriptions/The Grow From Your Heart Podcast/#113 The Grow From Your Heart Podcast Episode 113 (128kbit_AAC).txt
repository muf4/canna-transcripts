[SPEAKER_02]: Happy New Year, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for episode number 113 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_02]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_02]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_02]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: As always, I want to send a huge thank you
shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: To my friends in the Mystic Roots band for
letting me use their music on my show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy New Year, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you guys had a great new year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope you've made some new year's goals.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't made some goals for the new
year, you should grab a pen and a paper,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you should just write down a few
things that you want to accomplish in
[SPEAKER_02]: 2016.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you get that feeling of
accomplishment, you're going to want to
[SPEAKER_02]: accomplish bigger goals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just write down some goals and get that
shit done, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, if you had some bullshit in
2015, now is the time
[SPEAKER_02]: to shake it off and leave it all behind.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see you guys in the next one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to exhale.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to exhale all the bullshit
from 2015.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's take this dab together, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that was... All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I am heavily medicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this will be a fun podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to the Hitman Glass crew,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you follow Hitman Glass.

[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to turn down this music.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get on with the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, I also want to make a huge
announcement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Green and Healthy Wellness is now open for

[SPEAKER_02]: We are a medical marijuana facility in
Colorado Springs, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are at 430 West Colorado Avenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a medical marijuana card,
we would love to see you drop by,

[SPEAKER_02]: I'm proud of you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drop in, give us a visit.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else do we have for business?
[SPEAKER_02]: The sticker packs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember a few episodes ago, we did a
hashtag and everybody who messaged us on
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitter and used that hashtag,
they are going to get a sticker pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of nights ago, Mike and I sat
here and addressed envelopes and I will be
[SPEAKER_02]: stuffing stickers into those envelopes and
they will go out Monday morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when this podcast drops, those stickers
will be in the mail Monday, the same day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by the time you hear this, the stickers
are on the way to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've only got, let's see, how many do I
have here that are addressed?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got one, I've got two, and the third
person already got there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've only got two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you were involved in that and you
need to send me your address, send me your
[SPEAKER_02]: address to growfromyourheartathotmail.com
and remind me that you deserve stickers
[SPEAKER_02]: from the hashtag I like it when you ramble
sticker giveaway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remind me, I'll get you your stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else do we got in?
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to give a big shout out to my
buddy, Frosty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bumped into my friend Frosty at the
Canyon Canyon Dab Club the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Frosty, I smoked that Kush Bud that you
gave me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit, dude, I was high.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoked that this morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the first thing I smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made my eyes a little droopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made me want to be nice and lazy for
the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good weed, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always wonderful to receive the gift
of cannabis from friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super great when your friends tell
you that they listened to your podcast and
[SPEAKER_02]: learned how to improve their cannabis from
listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they give you buds that they
grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a shout out to Frosty.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's super good weed, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You did a good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well flushed, well cured and superbly
trimmed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like your work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I got to give a shout out to
everybody at the Canyon Canyon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I dropped into the Canyon Canyon and
everybody there is super kind,
[SPEAKER_02]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I walk in, everybody's like,
dab this, dab this, try this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried some live resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried some butter, tried some shatter,
smoked a little bit of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had some solvent lists, had some full
melt, had a little bit of everything the
[SPEAKER_02]: last time I was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate the way they treat me
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And shout out to all my friends at the
Canyon Canyon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Camille.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to everybody over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be doing an episode from there really
soon that features our friend Foxtrax.
[SPEAKER_02]: So keep your ears open for that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get to the point of the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been telling you that I was going to
make a checklist of things that you should
[SPEAKER_02]: be taking care of in your garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did that for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a list of things you should do
daily, weekly, monthly, things you should
[SPEAKER_02]: do after each harvest and also things that
you should do yearly.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a couple things on that list.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think I'm going to take a dab and a
drink while you guys listen to a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: seconds of reggae music.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will be right back and we will get
into this checklist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they say here comes trouble,
here comes the danger, sent by the savior,
[SPEAKER_01]: welcome the rasta.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here comes trouble, here comes the danger,
welcome the savior, welcome the rasta.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, you guys, I am back and I am
ready to get into this checklist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you guys are taking some dabs while
I was taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just hit some cactus cooler from Turpax.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've ever cracked open a can of
cactus cooler and taken a drink,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's exactly what this hash tastes like.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of got my mouth watering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever taken a dab that made your
mouth water?
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually your mouth goes dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me for coughing into the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was listening to a podcast today and the
co-host was just coughing into the
[SPEAKER_02]: microphone or I really wanted to turn off
the damn show.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I apologize for coughing into the mic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, this checklist, here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is stuff that I feel you should be
doing every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of this stuff will vary.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a hydro garden, some of this
stuff will be different.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a soil garden, some of this
stuff will be different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Based on the size of your garden,
some of this stuff will have to be done
[SPEAKER_02]: over a course of a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of this stuff will have to be,
if you've got a little garden,
[SPEAKER_02]: this stuff is just things that'll take you
two seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here is what I've got for your daily
checklist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Daily, visually check each plant for bugs,
molds, or signs of deficiencies or
[SPEAKER_02]: over-fertilization and correct if
necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to get in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I walk in and I just pick a random plant
and I just pull a random leaf off of a
[SPEAKER_02]: random plant and I flip it upside down and
I look at it and I make sure there's no
[SPEAKER_02]: bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel the leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell by feeling the leaf how healthy
the plant is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can kind of rub on the leaf and tell,
but I like to pull a leaf off,
[SPEAKER_02]: look for bugs, look for molds,
look around the room, see if any of the
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves are yellow or crispy or crunchy or
if anything's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got anything weird going in
there, work on correcting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something I should add, anything that can
be done today, do it today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't wait until tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got plenty of shit to do tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever you can do today, do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you just keep adding shit up for
tomorrow and then tomorrow never comes and
[SPEAKER_02]: then one of these days you're going to
have a big ass list of shit that you never
[SPEAKER_02]: did and you're going to find problems in
your grow and you're going to know why.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because you didn't do that list of
shit that you should have been keeping up
[SPEAKER_02]: on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So try to stay on top of your chores,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: So check your plants every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be touching every single plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be putting your eyes on every
single plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get in there and love them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the second thing on my list here,
check to see if the plants need water.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can check visually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see if the plants look droopy at
all, if they're starting to lean over,
[SPEAKER_02]: if the leaves are kind of hanging down,
they need water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or lift up the pot and check the weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: The standard way to do this is,
think about it this way, water your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water it until it's full, freshly watered.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pick it up and see how much it weighs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's its full weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it weighs half, half of that,
it's ready to be watered again.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to pour in water and get it wet
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So second thing, check to see if the
plants need water.
[SPEAKER_02]: The third thing I would do every single
day, pull any dead leaves and put them in
[SPEAKER_02]: a trash bag or a trash can that gets
removed from the garden area.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like to leave my trash bag or my
trash can in the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't make sense to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get that out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the reasons being, I apologize for
all the coughing and clearing over the
[SPEAKER_02]: throat.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll end here pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Took a couple of fat dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason I like to get yellowing leaves
out of the room is bugs are attracted to
[SPEAKER_02]: yellow leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bugs see yellow leaves as a perfect
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: The outer layer of the leaf has been
softened and they can bite in and get to
[SPEAKER_02]: the juicy insides of the leaves a little
more easily and bugs know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're attracted to yellow leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why your sticky traps are yellow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So get all the yellow leaves out of there,
put them in a trash can, put them in a
[SPEAKER_02]: trash bag and get them out of the room
because those are going to attract bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So get that shit away from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next thing I would recommend,
check the clones in the domes for
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check the humidity levels in your clones
and check for roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you've got roots, transplant them,
put them into the next, if they're going
[SPEAKER_02]: into the next size rock wall, put them
into there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're going into cups with soil,
throw them into there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they've got roots, do whatever you need
to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they need moisture or humidity,
adjust that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get in there and fix it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can fix the clone domes really easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next thing to do, check the temps
and the humidity of the room and adjust
[SPEAKER_02]: that if necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys try to aim for 40 to 60% humidity
during your bloom phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then during the veg phase,
you can be around 60 to 70% humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't go any higher than 70% humidity
and try to have some airflow along with
[SPEAKER_02]: that or you will get some issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try to keep the daytime temperature around
70 to 77 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like 74 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants really like 74.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the sativas like to get up to 77
during the day cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: During the night cycle, try to stay within
10 degrees of what your day cycle is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if during the day you're getting 77,
at night you want to be at 67 or a little
[SPEAKER_02]: higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go more than 10 degrees swing from
day to night.
[SPEAKER_02]: So during the day, 70 to 77.
[SPEAKER_02]: During the night, 60 to 65 degrees during
your night cycle is what I try to aim for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing that you need to do that a
lot of people forget to do and I can tell
[SPEAKER_02]: by your Instagram photos, sweep the damn
floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: All you got to do is get a broom and a
dust pan and a bucket and sweep the floor,
[SPEAKER_02]: scoop up that shit that you just swept up
into a dust pan, dump it into the bucket
[SPEAKER_02]: get it out of there and put it into a
trash can and get it out of the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that shit on the floor, first of all,
it looks terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do you want that shit on your floor in
your grow room?
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the leaves off there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the dirt off there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get that, I can't think of what that
shit's called right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That white stuff that sucks to step on the
perlite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the perlite up off the floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just sweep up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, it's not that hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every leaf on the floor, every little
piece of debris, that's a good spot for a
[SPEAKER_02]: bug to hide.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a problem with white flies,
fungus gnats, spider mites, aphids,
[SPEAKER_02]: thrips, that's another spot for a bug to
hide.
[SPEAKER_02]: One little tiny bug can hide under a leaf
and lay so many eggs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't give them the opportunity,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fight the battle at your advantage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't give these bugs a place to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sweep the floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next thing I would do, check any
equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check your hydro pumps, check the easy
cloner pumps, check your dehumidifiers.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're running hydro, check your mix
pump in your reservoir.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of guys have a big rez filled
with nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just put a pump in there to shoot the
nutrients around, check that pump.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure it hasn't gotten clogged up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those pumps have little filters on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They like to get gunky.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're using any kind of feed system,
check that thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure your sprinklers haven't gotten
clogged up.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got an easy cloner, check the
water level in that as well and refill it
[SPEAKER_02]: and adjust the pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next thing you should do,
check the pH and PPM levels if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: running any hydro.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a flood and drain kit,
if you're doing buckets or whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: check your pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also check your PPM.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to adjust your pH, you need to
adjust your PPMs almost every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen large hydro gardens need to be
topped off every day, if not twice a day
[SPEAKER_02]: because of water evaporation and plant
productivity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every time that water evaporates and
you add more water, you've got to adjust
[SPEAKER_02]: the pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: So check that shit out all the time,
every day if you can, twice a day if you
[SPEAKER_02]: can on that if you're running hydro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You hydro guys may have a little bit more
work to do than us soil guys, but we've
[SPEAKER_02]: got a lot of soil and dirt to deal with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the work will kind of math out,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't run a real hydro garden myself,
so I can't speak correctly on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it seems like you have a lot of
cleaning and a lot of maintenance to do on
[SPEAKER_02]: a hydro grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's next?
[SPEAKER_02]: Prune and train the plants and shape them
the way you want them for your grow space.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something you can be working on
every single day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind how you want those plants to
be shaped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the architecture correct so that you
have sturdy plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try to use up as much canopy space as you
can with each plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So prune and train your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take off all the shitty leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take off any little sucker leaves that are
happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just get rid of that crap make the plants
healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next step, lollipop any small crap
while you're in flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: All those little tiny buds that are
happening on the bottom, just cut that
[SPEAKER_02]: crap off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can lollipop all the way up through
week four.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done it up into week five.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you get the hang of it, you can
really get carried away.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll know what to cut off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll know what to leave.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're new at it, only do it for
the first couple of weeks, I guess,
[SPEAKER_02]: until you get the hang of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then once you've gotten a few crops under
your belt that you've lollipop,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll be able to do it up into week four
or five without pissing the plants off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done it too late and caused
hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I warn you to go light and then
learn how to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So lollipop stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take off all that small crap in flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pull off any funky leaves while you're
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next thing that you can do every
single day, you guys, take notes on
[SPEAKER_02]: everything you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just write down what you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I run a large grow for Green and Healthy
Wellness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, the owner of Green and Healthy
Wellness has put me in charge of the grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I say goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't ask me any questions as long as
at the end of the harvest, there's our
[SPEAKER_02]: goal weight of quality flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody's going to fuck with me and I'm
going to reach that goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the OCD person in me, the person that
likes to be accountable, I make notes of
[SPEAKER_02]: everything I do all day, every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I open up my phone, we could read
exactly what I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not exactly probably, but I mean pretty
close to every step I did today from
[SPEAKER_02]: walking in and checking the clones,
walking the rows and checking each plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: fixing the sprinklers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I write down what I do every day just
to keep accountability and to keep myself
[SPEAKER_02]: reminded of what's been done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that if something goes wrong,
I can look back on that and go,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, look, it was right here when I mixed
this stupid shit together, I messed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, you guys, a good reason to take
notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: This industry is expanding rapidly and
we're going to have marijuana available in
[SPEAKER_02]: every state before too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: When states start legalizing cannabis and
it's time to hire professional growers,
[SPEAKER_02]: you guys that took good notes of all your
grows, you guys are going to have a
[SPEAKER_02]: portfolio, basically an application or a
resume right there on paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can say, look, I took notes that shows
that you're organized.
[SPEAKER_02]: It shows that you're accountable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It shows that you're planning.
[SPEAKER_02]: It shows that you're thinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: It shows that you're serious.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the other guys are going to be able to
say, well, I grew this much weed in my
[SPEAKER_02]: mom's basement and they're not going to
have any pictures or any notes or anything
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys are taking notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have the advantage there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So take notes on everything you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talk about that a lot, but it's
something that I think is really serious
[SPEAKER_02]: in a cannabis grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: What if you do something different this
time and it comes out perfect?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to want to know what you did.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only way your dumb high ass is going
to remember is if you wrote it down
[SPEAKER_02]: because you're smoking too much good weed,
because you're growing too much good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So write shit down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is my weekly or my daily to do
checklist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm now going to move on to weekly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is stuff that you should be
handling once a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to pick Mondays and just kick
Monday's ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get all the chores done on Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then through the rest of the week,
you can just focus on the plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: keeping everything clean and doing all
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every Monday, this is what I would do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would start each week with a
well-planned feed in each room.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a clone area, if they've got
water in trays or in a cloner,
[SPEAKER_02]: dump that water out, put fresh water in
there, fresh nutrients, whatever you're
[SPEAKER_02]: using.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're using A and B in the cloner or
if you're using Rapid Start or if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: using Clon-X, whatever, put fresh solution
in your cloner, get it going fresh on
[SPEAKER_02]: Monday or whatever day you choose to
start.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once a week, clean that sucker out and
get it going fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also water all of your veg plants,
feed your veg plants with a strong
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient solution on Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're little babies, maybe just some
A and B.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're getting a little bigger,
maybe throw a little Liquid Karma in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're getting even bigger,
maybe they want some potassium silicates
[SPEAKER_02]: and maybe some Cal Mag in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should definitely be feeding your veg
plants a little bit of root inoculate
[SPEAKER_02]: also.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get those roots going.
[SPEAKER_02]: So also feed your flowering plants a
well-planned feed each week.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's time to flush, you need to start
flushing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's another good reason to take
notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you know when to flush.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys need help planning your
feeding, I did an episode all about
[SPEAKER_02]: feeding your flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So episode number 69 will give you a
weekly schedule of what to feed your
[SPEAKER_02]: plants while they're in flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to check that out,
that may be useful for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every week, feed your plants a
well-planned feed.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next thing I would do every week is
dust all of the fans, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those fans get dirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just dust the backs of them off.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to take off the screen and
clean the blades every week, that would be
[SPEAKER_02]: super cool of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your room would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of that dust is going to end up in
your dabs if you don't clean the fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think of it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next thing I would do is check the
timers for proper time and function.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be there when the lights come on a couple
of times a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you can't be there all the time
when the lights come on, but if you can,
[SPEAKER_02]: try to be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the lights come on at 9 o'clock,
just be standing outside of the room like
[SPEAKER_02]: 8.57 so that when the lights click on,
you can hear it go click, and then you can
[SPEAKER_02]: open the door.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make sure the timer is working,
and then be there again when the lights go
[SPEAKER_02]: off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just check the timers for proper time
and proper function.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every week, I would calibrate your meters
if you've got a pH meter.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should have one of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Calibrate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the 4, the 7, and the 10 solution,
and just calibrate that thing once a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a small-time grower and you have
a hydro store near you that you frequent,
[SPEAKER_02]: they will probably calibrate your pH meter
for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be nice and do that as a courtesy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So calibrate your pH meter.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should also have a PPM meter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Calibrate that as frequently as you can,
at least once a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: That can make a huge difference in the
quality of your flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're measuring something and your
meter is telling you that it's at 7,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's actually at 5, and you're
adjusting to get to 6.5, you're actually
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be adjusting down into the 4s,
and you're really going to cause problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So calibrate your meters, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next thing I would do at least once a
week is check all your blowers and fans
[SPEAKER_02]: and make sure that they're not clogged or
restricted in any way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the time, this can be done
visually.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can look around the room and see that
everything is working.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe put your hand, if you've got a big
vortex blower, just put your hand on the
[SPEAKER_02]: outside of the vortex blower and feel it
vibrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll know if some shit's wrong,
but just pay attention to that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's clogged up, that could be a fire
hazard.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's clogged up, that is going to cause
you electricity because that fan is
[SPEAKER_02]: spinning and you're not getting blowing
out of it, but you're using electricity
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's spinning and trying to break
free from that hair clog or whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got in there or those leaves that
are clogged in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just check those out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, before you go sticking your fingers
in any blowers, unplug them and give them
[SPEAKER_02]: a long time to quit spinning.
[SPEAKER_02]: They spin for a long time and just the
natural force of those fans spinning on
[SPEAKER_02]: their own weight, that's enough to put a
nice cut on your finger.
[SPEAKER_02]: So watch your fucking fingers,
those blowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've cut myself on a blower before.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucks more than you would ever know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take it from me.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's blood, sweat and tears in my
garden and that's where the blood came
[SPEAKER_02]: from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next thing, guys, visually check
the duct work and make sure that
[SPEAKER_02]: everything is sealed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're blowing a lot of pressure through
these ducts where the ducting connects to
[SPEAKER_02]: the lights, where the ducting connects to
the blower, where the ducting runs out of
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever room you're using.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just make sure that all that stuff is
sealed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, clean your air stones.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're making any kind of teas or
running any hydro or if you've got cloners
[SPEAKER_02]: with air stones or if you've just got
water sitting there to get bubbled to get
[SPEAKER_02]: the chlorine out, clean the air stones,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those things get murky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you might just want to throw
them away and replace them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are not that expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a few bucks, just go buy new
ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next thing, clean your dehumidifier or
humidifier filter.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Colorado, we probably don't even have a
dehumidifier in most rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use a humidifier in some places,
but clean those filters.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get funky.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit gets dirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything that has water running through it
frequently needs to be cleaned.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll get gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just clean your shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're running hydro, clean out your
reservoir every week to 10 days and start
[SPEAKER_02]: with fresh water and fresh nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I keep saying, water that sits around
that gets old gets gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit's able to grow in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things can colonize in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want fresh stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're running easy cloners,
do the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flush out those easy cloners.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked about that a minute ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just dump it out, fill it with fresh
water, fresh nutrients, pH it,
[SPEAKER_02]: and get it going all over again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your plants will love you for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to drink old, funky water,
do you?
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't even leave your dog's bowl
sitting there for too long without putting
[SPEAKER_02]: fresh water in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do that to your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're family, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something you're going to need to think
about weekly, you need to dispose of your
[SPEAKER_02]: grow room trash carefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the trash man comes, I would wait
until the morning and take the trash out
[SPEAKER_02]: when you know he's coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't leave that trash sitting out there
on the curb overnight.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's out there on the curb,
your trash is accessible to the public,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it is legal for police officers,
neighborhood kids, hungry homeless people,
[SPEAKER_02]: curious neighbors, whoever, private
investigators.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody can walk up to your trash and look
through your shit, and they can take it if
[SPEAKER_02]: they want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those guys stole my trash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they can do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They really can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, if you don't know the movie I'm
talking about, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was kind of cheesy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your trash is fair game if it's out there
on the curb.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a whole bunch of leaves in
there and you live in a state that is not
[SPEAKER_02]: legal to produce cannabis, that could be
evidence of a crime right there,
[SPEAKER_02]: so be careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dispose of your grow room trash very
carefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're doing a large grow, take it to
the dump yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guys at the dump don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just take it to the dump, have it in big
trash bags, just go drop it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't care that you're dropping off
weed leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those guys have their own business going
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So dispose of your grow room trash
carefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing I would recommend doing
weekly, look around the grow room,
[SPEAKER_02]: look on the walls and the ceiling and the
floors and look for any mold or moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got condensation happening
somewhere, figure out why that's
happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got any mold, I've seen blue
mold form on the walls in grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen little green mold form on the
walls in grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean that shit up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use H2O2.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use bleach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use peroxide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use something strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to go organic, do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do your thing, but clean that shit up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is unhealthy for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's unhealthy for the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Figure out why it's happening and resolve
the issue to make it not happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you've cleaned it, you've got to
figure out what caused it and stop it from
[SPEAKER_02]: happening or it'll just come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mold is a bitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can clean mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw somebody clean mold off of a wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say it was about the size of a
quarter, maybe a 50 cent piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she scrubbed the mold with bleach and
hot water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she called me the next day and she was
like, come over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want you to see this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I walked in and that mold had formed
into like a four by four square.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just grew that much in like 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've got mold, figure out what's
causing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may need to call a professional
eventually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't ruin our rental home growing weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I apologize for clearing the throat
so much in this episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've got a whole bunch of good dabs
from the Turp station.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to Turpex.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can blame all the throat clearing on
Jordan.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounded grosser than it was meant to,
but there we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's everything that you should do
and my opinion stuff that you should do
[SPEAKER_02]: weekly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to move on to things that you
should do monthly.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're running hydro or if you have a
feed system, I recommend that you clean
[SPEAKER_02]: the lines out some way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who recommended it to me?
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember who said it, Shane.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was our friend, Shane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shane recommended that you use an air
compressor to clean out the lines of your
[SPEAKER_02]: hydro system to blow out any clogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've got a feed system,
you've got a hydro system, clean that shit
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got little sprinklers,
clean those out.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got drippers, clean those out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might have to hand poke them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might have to get something pokey and
just hand poke each little hole out by
[SPEAKER_02]: hand, but you need them clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: So clean the shit out of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Monthly, clean your air conditioner
filters.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something that needs to be done
monthly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also test your smoke detectors.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should have smoke detectors in your
grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you don't want that shit burning
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it catches on fire, you want to heads
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So test your smoke detectors, replace the
battery if necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: That should be obvious.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing like hearing beep,
beep all the time when you're growing and
[SPEAKER_02]: the battery is trying to die.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the worst sound ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how anyone can live with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing you should do every month,
clean the glass in your reflectors.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, this may need to be done more or
less often, depending on your style.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're spraying in there, if you're
using a foliar spray, that shit's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: probably end up a little bit on the
reflectors unless you're careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're spraying bug sprays,
it's going to end up on the light
[SPEAKER_02]: reflectors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean that glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just clean it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can, slide the glass out,
clean the inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes your carbon filter blows a
little bit of carbon in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just clean that stuff up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're paying for the light to shine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's taking electricity.
[SPEAKER_02]: The light is shining.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't put a dirty lens between the light
and the plants that you're trying to put
[SPEAKER_02]: the light on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just makes more sense to clean it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're paying full price no matter what
you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of paying full price,
the next step.
[SPEAKER_02]: These may sound like no brainers,
but pay your electricity and water bills
[SPEAKER_02]: every month, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be okay running a whole bunch
of electricity and using a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: water, but the first time you miss a bill,
they're going to come fuck with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to knock on your door.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to want their money,
and that's when shit can go wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay your bills.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't ever try to ditch out on a grow
bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't ever steal electricity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't ever steal water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just pay your bills.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be a no brainer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the people that listen to this
show should already be doing that,
[SPEAKER_02]: but don't ever steal electricity.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do get caught stealing electricity
or water, the government, I think here,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was told that they're able to charge you
threefold for what you use.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you use $100 in electricity and you get
caught stealing it, they can charge you
[SPEAKER_02]: $300 just because you stole it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay upfront.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be a dick.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's well worth it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my stuff you should do monthly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to move into things that you
should do every harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every harvest, you're going to need to
dispose of your sticks and leaves that you
[SPEAKER_02]: have left over.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be a bunch of sticks and
a bunch of leaves and a bunch of trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the small trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to make cash out of that,
but a bunch of trim crap that you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want laying around.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, don't go throwing that in the
trash and just leaving it out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might want to wait for the trash guy
to come.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might want to find a friend who has a
construction site and get permission to
[SPEAKER_02]: throw your trash in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go using someone's dumpster because
if you get caught doing that, that's a
[SPEAKER_02]: fine for throwing your trash into somebody
else's shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they'll want to see what you threw in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then this cop's looking at you and your
big ass bag of weed leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you're trying to figure out a store.
[SPEAKER_02]: Figure out a clever way, a safe way,
a smart way to get rid of all your sticks
[SPEAKER_02]: and leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, dispose of or compost or recycle all
of your soil carefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to be in the backyard
dumping out your old pots and then your
[SPEAKER_02]: backyard ends up full of perlite and it's
all white and speckly and the dirt doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: look right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't be that guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to figure out a way to either
dispose of or recycle all of that soil
[SPEAKER_02]: that you use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Recycling soil isn't as hard as you would
imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just needs to be re-amended and stirred
around and then you can definitely use
[SPEAKER_02]: that soil again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Figure out a way to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done a little bit of talking about
that on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still experimenting with it myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once I get good at it, I'll do a full
episode on recycling soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made a little note about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have to learn how to get
rid of a bunch of dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have sticks and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, if you're running hydro,
you're going to have rock wool cubes or
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to have those hydroton clay
pellets.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have to get rid of that
shit too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure you can recycle the rock
wool cubes, the hydroton pellets.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can rinse them off and use them again.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can clean them, but eventually you've
got to throw those away because they get
[SPEAKER_02]: funky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go throwing those into your trash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you get rid of those safely and
smartly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is smartly a word?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, clean your pots, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every harvest you should clean your pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should also clean your hydro trays.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a four by four botanic care
tray or one of those four by eight trays,
[SPEAKER_02]: you should clean those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to think I'm crazy,
but here's how I recommend you do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Throw it in the truck and just take them
right to the car wash and just line the
[SPEAKER_02]: pots up against the wall and just spray
the shit out of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Colorado here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody knows what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just go spray your shit down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody cares.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hydro trays, lean it up against the
side of the truck, spray the shit out of
[SPEAKER_02]: it, throw it in the back of the truck,
take it home.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in another state, that may be
kind of weird, but if cannabis is legal,
[SPEAKER_02]: just take them to the car wash and hose
them down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't use any soap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't use the car washing soap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't wax them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just use hot water on them with the high
pressure thing and just spray the shit out
[SPEAKER_02]: of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It works really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you've got your pots cleaned,
I recommend you clean the room thoroughly
[SPEAKER_02]: from top to bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said earlier, use H2O2, use bleach,
use hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a thousand other products I
could say to use, but use something to get
[SPEAKER_02]: in there and sanitize the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't just clean it up, sanitize it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our good friend Mike helps me out when
it's time to clean the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike and I dress up in our little let's
get clean suits.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically just our shittiest clothes
we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put bandanas on our faces, put our hair in
crazy hats.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go down in there and just clean
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time we're done, you can eat off
the floor of my grow rooms when they're
[SPEAKER_02]: freshly started.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is so gorgeous in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since I'm talking about Mike, I want to
give him a shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We recorded a podcast last night and the
recording sounded like shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something went wrong in the recording
software and everything sounded like
[SPEAKER_02]: robots.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounded like R2D2 and Darth Vader and
B8 having conversations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just deleted that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize to Mike for that podcast,
never making it to the air, but you know
[SPEAKER_02]: he'll be back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, you'll be back, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry that did not work, but you'll
get over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to come dab and hang out anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming and let's get back into
the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sanitize your room, every harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I was saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, clean the floors and the walls and
the ceiling, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wipe them down, scrub them down.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ceiling gets funky.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's humid.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're in there spraying pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're in there spraying foliar sprays.
[SPEAKER_02]: That puts moisture everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it gets humid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water rises.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ceiling is going to get funkier than
you're going to assume, so just scrub it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll think it's clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll hit it with the rag and you'll
realize it is not clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: The walls, obviously, same thing with the
foliar spray, same thing with the
[SPEAKER_02]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: The floors, everything lands on the floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've spilled nutrients there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been walking there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just filthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, inspect any seals you've made.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've sealed up any windows or doors
or anything like that, if you've put
[SPEAKER_02]: caulking somewhere, re-caulk it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've taped it, re-tape it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, if you've put up, I put up HEPA
filters.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I've got a wall between two rooms and
I'm pulling air from one room to the
[SPEAKER_02]: other, I just go to Lowe's and buy those
little square HEPA filters and I just cut
[SPEAKER_02]: them kind of close to the shape I want and
just staple them to the wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: I replace those every time, every harvest
also.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to because they get dusty.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get dirty, but they keep all the funk
out of the room, so just go ahead and
[SPEAKER_02]: replace those.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's always a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just those little square HEPA filters.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find them at Lowe's.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can't find those, just use any kind
of filter will work for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just better than having the hole
where the air is moving open.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just want to put a filter over there
to catch the dirt or any bugs or anything
[SPEAKER_02]: that may be trying to move around,
trying to migrate from place to place.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yearly, here are a couple of things that I
think you should do every single year as a
[SPEAKER_02]: grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I forgot to mention, every harvest,
that little sleeve that goes around your
[SPEAKER_02]: carbon filter, take that off and clean it
and put it back on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good luck not getting carbon everywhere
the next time you turn on your carbon
[SPEAKER_02]: filter.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are tons of tricks on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you use a carbon filter, every time
you move it, you jar the carbon inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you put a blower on there and you
plug in the blower to start blowing the
[SPEAKER_02]: air through the filter just to use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then all that carbon you've just stirred
goes flying through all of your lights and
[SPEAKER_02]: into your grow room.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to figure out a smart way to
catch that carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I do is I blow it into a ... What is
it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't think of the brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Crown Royal Bag because the Crown
Royal Bag will let the air out,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it'll catch all of the particulate
that's coming through.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just put the ducting into a Crown Royal
Bag and hold it and then plug it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: That blows into there for a couple
seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I just pull that off and seal it up
and I've caught all the carbon in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a trick, a really weird random
trick to keep all of the carbon from
[SPEAKER_02]: blowing out when you've got a new carbon
filter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take that little cover off, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes with the sleeve.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take that off, clean it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like shit when it's all dusty
anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want that white and clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put some OxiClean in the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get that sucker white again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yearly, here's where we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yearly, replace your carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy at the hydro shop swears to me
that my carbon filters are going to last
[SPEAKER_02]: two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do not.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a guy replacing a transformer in
my backyard a couple of weeks ago and he
[SPEAKER_02]: told me, sir, it smells like you got a
skunk back here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were no skunks back there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a little bit of grateful dog
crossed a space queen and it was stinking
[SPEAKER_02]: up the whole neighborhood because my
carbon filter needed to be replaced.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a new one sitting there now.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as I rebuild the room,
I'll have a fresh filter.
[SPEAKER_02]: The neighbors will quit smelling the candy
scented skunks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Replace your carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_02]: They only last about a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing that you should do every
year, you guys, have your fire
[SPEAKER_02]: extinguisher checked and replaced or
charged.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got a little red, yellow,
and green gauge on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want it all the way in the green.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it starts to get to yellow,
it's not reliable anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a new fire extinguisher.
[SPEAKER_02]: You either need to go get it charged or
just buy a new one.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sell them at Lowe's.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sell them at Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, you never need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really hope you never need it,
but if you do, you want it fully charged.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always have a fire extinguisher near your
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a bedroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a flowering room.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a fire extinguisher hanging on the
outside of my flowering room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have it on the outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you hear that smoke alarm in there
going off, grab the fire extinguisher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check the door for heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's stupid hot, you have a decision to
make.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to open that door or not?
[SPEAKER_02]: Open that door.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hit that fucker with the fire extinguisher
that you've already got in your hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to open the door and run in
there and find the fire extinguisher in
[SPEAKER_02]: the smoky, hot, fiery room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have it on the outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, I pray to Jah that you never have
to use your fire extinguisher,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'd rather you have it and it work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rather you be safe than this thing
fail on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got another fire extinguisher right
just outside the bedroom also.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where shit can go wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of lights, a lot of
electricity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just want to be a responsible grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try to be responsible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your fire extinguisher inspected and
replaced once a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's all I've got for the
checklist, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really want to thank all my friends on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: I posted to Facebook asking for some
updates, and a lot of people contributed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many of you that I'm not even going to
try to list everybody, so shout out to my
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook community that helped out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I truly appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some things I did leave out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that things got left out
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll need to work on a pest management
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll need to integrate that into this
checklist somehow.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't see any issues, you can
simply spray once a week with an organic
[SPEAKER_02]: application, whatever you want to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use Azimax if there's no problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since I travel from so many gardens,
I hit my plants once a week with Azimax
[SPEAKER_02]: when they're in veg just to make sure that
I don't bring any anything home from all
[SPEAKER_02]: the other gardens I play in.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you see any issues in your garden,
you may need to increase the frequency and
[SPEAKER_02]: the potency of whatever you're spraying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe change the active ingredient to
something a little bit stronger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully you don't get any pests if
you're doing something preventative,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's something you'll have to work
into this regimen here as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also going to be a point in time
where you're going to need to change your
[SPEAKER_02]: light bulbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did another episode on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every bulb is different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every garden is different.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about swapping out your thousand
watt HPS bulbs about every one to three
[SPEAKER_02]: harvests.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard people using them for a full
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard people using them for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like I said earlier, when your bulbs
start diminishing, your eyes won't notice
[SPEAKER_02]: it, but your plants will, and you're still
paying for all of the electricity.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a thousand watt bulb and
it's like six months old, it's probably
[SPEAKER_02]: only putting out 60 to 70% of its output,
but you're paying for 100% of that
[SPEAKER_02]: thousand watts to be running.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go upgrade your bulbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't cost that much money.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think about how much herb you're
going to grow from a fresh bulb,
[SPEAKER_02]: the difference, the cost of that bulb
should definitely be worth it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I've got for you on a
checklist of things that you should be
[SPEAKER_02]: doing in your garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be shy to send me things that I
missed.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's something you want to add to
this, if there's something I did wrong,
[SPEAKER_02]: let me know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: No matter what you've got to say,
send me an email.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find me on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's at GFYHpodcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can hit me up on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's simply Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you know my personal Facebook,
you can find me there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you know me, you can text me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can call me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me whatever you want to tell me about
the podcast, but I'd love to hear what you
[SPEAKER_02]: think of this garden checklist.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's something I missed,
let me know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do a part two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you guys check out the next
[SPEAKER_02]: video.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see you guys in the next one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll read three or four, four or five
comments, and we'll share that with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd appreciate it if you'd go and do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What that does is that exposes the show to
more people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll move us up in the rankings.
[SPEAKER_02]: More people will see the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: More people will listen.
[SPEAKER_02]: More people will grow better cannabis,
and that's the main goal here is just get
[SPEAKER_02]: more people to grow better cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you guys, don't forget that the show
is available on iTunes, Stitcher,
[SPEAKER_02]: and every single episode is always and
forever archived on ireadgeneticscolorado
[SPEAKER_02]: .com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't forget about the donation button on
the website.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys on the top right, if you go to
ireadgeneticscolorado.com, click on the
[SPEAKER_02]: grow from your heart podcast tab.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the top right, there is a donation
button.
[SPEAKER_02]: That goes directly to my PayPal account.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've said it before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm never going to charge you for this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: This podcast is always going to be free,
but if you'd like to make a contribution,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would truly appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're curious where your contribution
goes, it goes to paying for the hosting of
[SPEAKER_02]: my website.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes for things like new microphone
covers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to have microphone covers for the
guests because they do this kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You hear that?
[SPEAKER_02]: They rub their faces all over the
microphones when they're talking because
[SPEAKER_02]: they're new.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to have a cover for each guest so
that they don't have to go rubbing their
[SPEAKER_02]: face on another person's mic cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think that that's gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water bottles for all of the guests,
but mostly it goes to covering the
[SPEAKER_02]: Bluehost hosting fee, which is where I
have my website, which is where I host
[SPEAKER_02]: this show.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's 113 episodes up there,
so it does take a little bit of bandwidth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I'm just letting you know where
that goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not begging.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you'd like to contribute, I would
definitely, definitely appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd give you a big shout out on the show,
send you a couple of stickers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, what else do I have for you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you listen next week.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys will have foxtracks on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's all I've got.

irey underscore genetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna give a huge shout out to my
ninja Spence.

time, take a fat dab and give your mama a
[SPEAKER_02]: hug for me.
