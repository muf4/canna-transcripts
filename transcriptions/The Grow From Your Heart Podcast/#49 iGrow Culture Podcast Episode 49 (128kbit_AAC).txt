[SPEAKER_03]: Yo, what's up cannabis community?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for another episode of the grow
from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to episode number 49.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I apologize in advance.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can already tell that my voice sounds
all terrible because I've got a cold,
[SPEAKER_03]: but as a professional podcaster,
the show must go on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so I'm going to skip that long intro
that I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're just going to introduce
everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's here to my left.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got Adam.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, brother?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo, what's up, man?
[SPEAKER_03]: To the left of him is white Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: How you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: And over here is everybody's favorite.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Jesse.
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_03]: Good, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming to you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having us back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: These guys actually messaged me today and
they were like podcast around seven 30.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a long Christmas season,
but eight 30 ish.
[SPEAKER_03]: They all showed up and now we're here to
do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, man, yeah, I want to apologize.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could tell that I'm going to sound
stuffy.
[SPEAKER_03]: There may be a pause or two in this
episode for me to take care of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a broken pipe in my brain somewhere
and my nose faucet is just dripping,
[SPEAKER_03]: dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not real professional sound and I
apologize in advance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Need some plumbers crack.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need, yeah, no, wait, no plumbers crack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some plumbers putty or taper some shit,
but no, no, no crack in my face.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about plumbers on crack?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as they can get here on time and
get my nose fixed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think enough, uh, I've been drinking
lots of good, uh, hydrating liquids and
[SPEAKER_03]: shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should be cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to coconut water.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's been helping me out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do owe a big shout out to Coot and Kat
from the Mystic Roots band for letting me
[SPEAKER_03]: play their music on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, can we talk about the project
D-Boy's been working on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we allowed to talk about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: These guys showed up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: They look beat, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of them look like they have just been
through the freaking wringer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I run them pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a long couple of weeks,
but a good couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Jesse is apparently the boss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a long story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm a full blown consultant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me tell you what I'll do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything you need to get your place going,
including accidentally start a
[SPEAKER_04]: construction company.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He'll build your grow out and then he'll
supply it with grow supplies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then him and I will teach you how to
grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we've got a grow team on hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need employees, we'll sell you
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can hook you up, start to finish folks
with oil producers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we do have quite a team here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys have been saying that Adam has
fucking found his niche.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all found his wheelhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been hunting for, for a while now,
and we, we for sure found it.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long you been here now, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it'll be a year in February.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be a year in February, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: You fell in pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy here, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking about that today.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I, uh, Colorado has changed me
for the better.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I used to be a hermit and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, just getting out, you know,
we all felt it today.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he, when he asked me like,
let's go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, yeah, I'm, I'm in,
you know, uh, the other podcasts were
[SPEAKER_02]: great, but you just, you, you felt it in
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were like, I miss my friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun doing those week, those holiday
shows without you guys were cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to ramble and you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I felt an evolution in myself because if
my voice changed, I honestly just stuck a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of toilet paper in my nose to keep my
nose from freaking running.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's dripping and it's disgusting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I sound weird, that's why it's not
puberty issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not me cracking, but no, it was fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got, I felt the evolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause those earlier shows, when it was me
on the mic by myself, it felt like I was
[SPEAKER_03]: reading it like this body.
[SPEAKER_03]: Podcast is brought to you by nature's
green remedies.com is what it felt like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last couple episodes, I flipped the papers
over that I had on the desk and just
[SPEAKER_03]: started talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, yeah, fuck all the notes.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what I want to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun to kind of put it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was way more comfortable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was, it was good, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't too much at the beginning know
how to put, nobody cared about me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I didn't want to come out and be
like, this is me and my podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I made friends with all my
listeners.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they do kind of care.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're saying that Adam's found his
wheelhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: This kid's a framer.
[SPEAKER_03]: He swings a hammer and frames like a
champ.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who would have known?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had opportunities offered to me like,
let's go start a business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, dude, you don't,
I have problems, you know, and at this
[SPEAKER_02]: table, a lot of these people kind of
understand those problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's, it's that stoner kind
of mentality where, you know, do not play
[SPEAKER_02]: well with others on some.
[SPEAKER_02]: I may not, but who doesn't?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a job site.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not fucking, it's not an office,
you know, like, you go off and cool off
[SPEAKER_02]: for 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always one guy at work every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one person has a problem and that one
guy's got a stick up his ass and it seems
[SPEAKER_03]: to rotate.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just how job sites are.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're doing construction and unheated,
sometimes poorly or unlit warehouses.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, tempers can flare quickly,
but we've got the team pretty chilled out
[SPEAKER_04]: and like, okay, go take a 20, show
yourself outbreak is pretty standard.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've learned to swing it correctly.
[SPEAKER_04]: No tools go flying at each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Regularly anymore.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a reason, that's part of the
reason why I don't do construction.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd rather just be a lone wolf growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I kind of, sometimes I'm like,
man, these guys are having fun all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to go to work somewhere with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm like, or I could just maybe,
maybe one day, but as you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: as for me, I gotta get, I gotta get some
money set up before I can hate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Tuesday night as we record,
I actually have another meeting tomorrow
[SPEAKER_03]: in the morning at the spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So things are starting to definitely come
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in there checking out the grow a few
days ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a mess.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're getting a lot of shit done.
[SPEAKER_03]: The floors, the walls and the ceiling are
all the same material.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looks like one sheet of everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't find the seams in this material.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these rooms are bigger than my house.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, how the fuck did they do this,
dude?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when they get those finished,
I'll be growing in there, but I'm going
[SPEAKER_03]: tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're actually talking about sending me
to, there's a company that built our grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're talking about sending me to their
flagship grow so that I can go check it
[SPEAKER_03]: out and see what happens and learn from
their grow a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a cannabis grow?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a cannabis grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's by, I don't want to say the
wrong name.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I was told that I was wrong about who
made that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a company that made it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then another guy kind of, he was part
of that company.
[SPEAKER_03]: He separated from them and improved on it
and sold them the improved ideas.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've seen it?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, seen it get built is also a different
perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, we're not lights or
anything like that, but just, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: preparation for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they going to hire like a grow
specific company to come in there and do
[SPEAKER_03]: that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you guys doing it all the way to the
end?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do it with advice from,
you know, I have reps phone numbers in my,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, HVAC guys, electricians.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're having a HVAC company come in
and put in specific units and specifically
[SPEAKER_01]: set up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're building a personal grow,
get a real electrician, just have them
[SPEAKER_03]: inspect everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many electricians on Craigslist
Craigslist and shit that are, they're
[SPEAKER_03]: legit.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to snitch on you for
growing herb.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're in Colorado, get an electrician.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be that asshole that burned down
your house by trying to grow too many
[SPEAKER_03]: lights in one room.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a story in the paper today,
some idiot brewing hooch blew his house up
[SPEAKER_04]: and I saw the photo and I explosion in
Pueblo County.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went, Oh shit, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got down to alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to give them the idea,
but I strongly suspect they were making
[SPEAKER_03]: BHO in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, I don't see how alcohol would
have, I mean, that was a big thing during
[SPEAKER_04]: prohibition with this, why you can't make
hard alcohol in your own home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do people still do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a couple of guys from where I'm
from.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do it up in the woods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not doing it in an apartment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't, don't be that asshole to blow
some shit up guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're making, I've got a news article.
[SPEAKER_03]: That we're actually going to read a little
later about making BHO.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to do an ad really quickly just
cause we've got to sneak these in.

[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'll pick up a bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk about it on the show a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of Grow Kashi, I'm going to kind
of branch off here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw a box of prizes being donated to the
show from Hygro Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_03]: There might be some Grow Kashi.
[SPEAKER_03]: There might be some OGT.
[SPEAKER_03]: OGT is not going to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to jack that out of there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's actually a bag of Grow Kashi.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some OGT and there are some other
nutrients in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some really cool things in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some grab bag or swag bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our good friend Task Rock sent us a highly
educated t-shirt in size large.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a couple few irie genetics
t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a couple of hat pins in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an irie sticker pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spence from the Garden of Whedon may
possibly have some prizes for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's a couple of Garden of
Whedon stickers because I've got those.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hoping to get a shirt from him,
but the man is busy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So guys, check out episode 50.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hoping to have all three of these guys
back plus Matty and Spence, which means
[SPEAKER_03]: it's going to be crowded as I'm looking at
the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a busy time, but we'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll figure it out a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got more chairs over there and we'll
figure it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll stand up the whole time and act like
a game show host or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not a whole lot to talk about in
this episode, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I felt like crap today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't prepare and I just wanted to have
these guys over.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to kind of bullshit and read a
news article.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before I do that, I got to say shout out
to treethugger.com.

important part I'm supposed to make sure I
[SPEAKER_03]: cover.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys want to read a weird news
article?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's four men sitting at this table and
I'm about to say the word vagina a whole
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of times.
[SPEAKER_03]: This article is from The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's cool about The Cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: When I open up The Cannabis website right
on the top, there is an advertisement for
[SPEAKER_03]: The Spot, Southern Colorado's largest
dispensary, no long waits, friendly bud
[SPEAKER_03]: tenders and new strains weekly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Visit us today at The Spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Spot did not pay for that ad,
but I endorse The Spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, there's a cute little bud tender
with dreadlocks over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go visit it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Visit her.
[SPEAKER_03]: Say what's up.
[SPEAKER_03]: She'll sell you some dank herbs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go visit The Spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: This article is by Ricardo Baca.
[SPEAKER_03]: The headline is that weed infused sex lube
for ladies.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be on Colorado shelves this month.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I said.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody in the room just looked at me
like, what the fuck, dude?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard about this so many times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw that this morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was just some satire shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You thought it was the onion?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this is a product that's gotten a lot
of press over the last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been in Cali for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it has.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's the same product.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it says, remember when we first wrote
about THC infused sex lube, Floria,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's quite singular user instructions
in June 2014?
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, apply four to eight sprays
directly onto the clitoris, inner and
[SPEAKER_03]: outer labia and inside the vagina.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always like counting the number of
sprays in the middle of sex.
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't they used to do the same thing with
Lysol?
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually said quite singular user
instructions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not during sex.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is by yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: This chick's sitting on the couch or
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: You do four and wait and see if you feel
anything and then do three or four more
[SPEAKER_03]: later.
[SPEAKER_04]: What if it hits you like a truck?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a mucous membrane.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all a mucous membrane.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to happen quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be in a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds horrible.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all for the product.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, the number of pumps thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's ours?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I want to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is it always like, I get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to continue with the article
before it goes on a porn rant.
[SPEAKER_03]: That interview with Los Angeles based for
you founder, Matthew Gerson helps
[SPEAKER_03]: introduce the unique product to the
masses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now Gerson who originally hails from
Boulder is debuting his special
[SPEAKER_03]: non-psychoactive lube outside of
California for the very first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Floria will make its Colorado debut at the
native roots location in Aspen during the
[SPEAKER_03]: winter X games on January 21st through
25th.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's confused.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are they?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are they?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are they targeting?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're debuting your THC infused sex lube
at the X games.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I'm high, but I totally just heard
all those words in the correct order.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I want to cross the line
of words I want to say on this show right
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your pussy got all beat up at the X games.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's some lube to make it freaking feel
a little better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the article says, I came out to LA from
Colorado and I've been trying to get back
[SPEAKER_03]: ever since Gerson told the cannabis,
I'm super excited to be bringing it to
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado and native roots is a good
alignment for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it'll be available at native roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Need a reminder on what Floria is per
Gerson from my June interview with him.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a sensual enhancement oil designed
for female pleasure, a therapeutic
[SPEAKER_03]: aphrodisiac.
[SPEAKER_03]: Women have described it as relaxing and
they've said it's heightened their
[SPEAKER_03]: sensations.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've associated it with warming and
tingling localized in the sexual region.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's where you're spraying it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to feel it on your arm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Floria will be on sale at native
roots, uh, native roots is new Aspen
[SPEAKER_03]: location at 308 south Hunter street
throughout the X games and all other
[SPEAKER_03]: native roots locations after the big
event.
[SPEAKER_03]: Native roots is Floria's partner in
Colorado and how have the last six months
[SPEAKER_03]: been for Floria in California?
[SPEAKER_03]: He says we never could have imagined the
impact it's having on the patient
[SPEAKER_03]: community in California and how it's
spanned the spectrum of users from younger
[SPEAKER_03]: women who are looking to deepen,
looking to deepen the level of intimacy of
[SPEAKER_03]: their own bodies to older women who are
experiencing a reawakening of their own
[SPEAKER_03]: sexuality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gerson said, there are a large number of
women who could benefit from cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: but who aren't interested in the
psychoactive component.
[SPEAKER_03]: The product's expansion into Colorado is
only the beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gerson estimates Floria will be available
in Washington state pot stores in the next
[SPEAKER_02]: few months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anybody else want to get this for a
chick they hate and be like, I got you
[SPEAKER_02]: this great perfume and just like,
here you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it'd be funny to get you a bottle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you take a big dab and start
crying, I can do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would spray the roast beef sandwich
down, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Non-psychoactive in Colorado, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Non-psychoactive, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a guy that claims he made a lube
using coconut oil and cannabis and he says
[SPEAKER_03]: when he uses it on chicks that they
definitely enjoy it a lot more than when
[SPEAKER_03]: he doesn't use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it'd be fun to read this with
four dudes at the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also like cannabis a lot more when I use
it prior than when I don't use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The article was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just fucking puns and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard a lot of placebo warnings about
this, you know, where as in... I paid $80
[SPEAKER_04]: for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something better tingle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if she's going to, if she's spraying
it on her clit and entering out her labia,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's working.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's already moisten and shit up and
that's waking it up a little.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even if it doesn't work, but have you
ever eaten like tincture or I guess it's
[SPEAKER_03]: just tincture that does it, but you get
warm inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you feel warm and fuzzy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can just imagine spending some tincture
on my junk though, letting it get all
[SPEAKER_02]: sticky and gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I felt that night from that
mountain bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's the whole feeling that I
really got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you rub the mountain bar on your junk?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll try that next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be $12 well spent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you how much right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think... 350 milligrams back from THC
right to my tank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I refrained myself from using taint
earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done ruin that for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know a product that definitely does
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: That apothecanna pain relief cream.
[SPEAKER_03]: Extra strength.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the juniper arnica cannabis stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I didn't believe in it to tell you
the truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Topicals definitely worked.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was skeptical about it because I'm a
pothead.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you got to smoke weed or consume
cannabis somehow to get high, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But my girlfriend, actually the Grammy
Gatsby gave me a box bottle of that
[SPEAKER_03]: apothecanna and I rubbed my girlfriend
down with it for like an hour and a half
[SPEAKER_03]: one night.
[SPEAKER_03]: To quote Pink Floyd, my hands felt just
like two balloons.
[SPEAKER_03]: I felt like I had Mickey Mouse gloves on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, my hands are big.
[SPEAKER_03]: They felt all fluffy and bigger than they
were.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a dream or something?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, kind of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd go to scratch my face and punch myself
in the head a little bit because my
[SPEAKER_03]: fingers were there already.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like I had boxing gloves on.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mom used that and she said she got high
as shit from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I don't know about getting high as
shit from it, but I definitely felt- My
[SPEAKER_02]: mom's a very small smoker though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe she did.
[SPEAKER_03]: It definitely helps.
[SPEAKER_03]: I start off the massage with just coconut
oil to kind of start a massage and get her
[SPEAKER_03]: loosened up and get her lubed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to avoid the word lubed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if I use that apothecanna right
away, it absorbs in too quickly and I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't think it spreads enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I get her coconut oiled and then I put
the apothecanna in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely I can tell that she can,
I can see that she loosens up as soon as
[SPEAKER_03]: that apothecanna starts getting in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I had to use that word.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was just nothing else to describe
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He knew.
[SPEAKER_02]: He gets it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't want to use lube.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't want to use the word lube,
but sometimes you got to take that jump
[SPEAKER_03]: and say words that you're trying to avoid.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people don't like the word moist.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Moist, like really bothers you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the way some people say it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Moist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moist like a properly ready taco.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you've been using that spray.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you've been using that cannabis spray
maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to try to put this show back
on track.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's another article from the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so fucking lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't even talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still got this Kleenex in my nose too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Face stamp on.
[SPEAKER_03]: This article is written by John Engel and
Jordan Stefan from the Denver Post.
[SPEAKER_03]: The headline is hash oil legality now
questioned for Colorado courts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the sub headline is by the end of
Wednesday hearing Denver district court
[SPEAKER_03]: judge A.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bruce Jones had concluded both sides were
wrong, though it was still unclear how he
[SPEAKER_03]: would ultimately rule.
[SPEAKER_03]: Side note.
[SPEAKER_03]: This dude's name is A.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bruce Jones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you a bad motherfucker if your first
name is just an initial?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's frustrating.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This dude chose to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's A.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bruce Jones.
[SPEAKER_04]: He chose to do it or his parents just
tagged it to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess if I wanted to be a poet or
something, my middle name is Scott.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd be J.
[SPEAKER_03]: Scott.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then my last name.
[SPEAKER_03]: I almost said it on the show, but I ain't
going to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it'd be J.
[SPEAKER_03]: Scott Rasta.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want him to go that way,
you don't have to change your name to
[SPEAKER_04]: become a poet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that really sophisticated?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what he's trying to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is his first name just like 17 letters
and starts with A.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their little nickname for me at work and
shit is what I used to get teased as,
[SPEAKER_02]: as like five.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, that's what used to hurt,
you know, like when you're a kid and the
[SPEAKER_02]: kids find that one thing, you know,
like go at it forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm, I'm an adult now,
so it's, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, there's those times where
it's both of them sitting in the corner.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sitting here trying to remember what
year the Joe Dirt was released.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was when you were five.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was actually shot from afar.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just followed me around.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if Joe Dirt, and if you guys,
I don't know if you guys watch King of the
[SPEAKER_03]: Hill, but if Lucky from King of the Hill
and Joe Dirt had a kid, it would be Adam.
[SPEAKER_03]: And his name would be 44.
[SPEAKER_01]: 44, dear day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been calling him Joe Dirt lately for
a whole nother reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's a handy little motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to tell the story about what
you did with your Shatter the other day?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me, anybody out there that's a
little inexperienced, I'm from the South.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've not been dabbing that long,
but so I took Shatter to work and I was
[SPEAKER_02]: like, Oh, it's all cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we, we got in the car and I'm sitting
there and I'm like, let's, let's do a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's, you know, yeah, that doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I try and it's shattering everywhere
and I'm spilling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably lost half a gram that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, you know what I'll do?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll pick it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll hold the torch and I'll just,
you know, waft it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll use my thumb as like a guard to
protect the heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that worked fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: That worked great.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were attempting to blow torch the hash
lightly to kind of melt it a little,
[SPEAKER_03]: to make it more workable?
[SPEAKER_02]: Correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: In between two pieces of parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some high quality concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely some of the best hash
around, you know, town and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I fucked it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, this is working.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just set it down and do the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen to me, people don't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold it in your hands or yeah,
I burned a bunch of money that day for
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just went poof up in flames.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was way too late by that part.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, yeah, it's like a match
book.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt bad for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, nobody else did.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all laughed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned something though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, it was, I laughed later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just not that funny.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't funny to him in the moment,
but it was great and will continue to be
[SPEAKER_04]: quite funny to everybody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Break time really sucked at that point in
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, I was done with the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody bring any shatter?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because I'm out, because I'm broke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you burned it all on that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a little over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was, that was an expensive fucking
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some a unicorn hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm saving for Friday night.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually dabbed up all my unicorn hash
last night.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got about a little, half a container for
Friday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget what we saw today, but we saw a
unicorn.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was just rarity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was on the way to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't, I don't remember what it was now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll ask in the morning what we saw,
but it was definitely unicorn.
[SPEAKER_03]: You saw something that was so cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't even know what the fuck it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this is rare.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's, that's weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, I was going to read a news
article.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to take a dab and then try that.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is going to be like my third dab of
the day when it's nine 15.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually I start off the day with a couple
of fat dads.
[SPEAKER_03]: If that tells you anything about how I
felt today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Been trying to get hydrated, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so hard to get hydrated once you're
dehydrated and being sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't drink that then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't drink this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bong water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just like, gotta get hydrated.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about being hydrated and
pick up the rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for being a friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would have been miserable.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's probably like a good gram of
reclaimed just float on top of that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would have been the worst drink ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody out there would definitely pay
money to just like scrape your,
[SPEAKER_02]: your pipes, you know, and your reclaim.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's, I was on tiny chat last night and
I showed somebody my hash and he's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: is that your dab?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he goes, just dab it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I weighed it and it was 0.5 and I
was like, well, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I typed it's 0.5 and he just nodded
like, uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I was like, God damn it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy knows me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I did a half gram dab last night on
tiny chat and it was fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I went to bed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I am on bong TV live guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is me.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you wondered, but if you're ever
cruising through bong TV live and you see
[SPEAKER_03]: that white guy with the dreadlocks and an
Irish shirt, I've always got my sunglasses
[SPEAKER_03]: and a hat on taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's me, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Rasta Jeff on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Say what's up if you want to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, somebody talk while I take a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we were, uh, talking earlier today
that 50 is going to be jam packed full of
[SPEAKER_02]: chaos and that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so pumped for 50, like the giveaway
and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, I'm sure everybody's pumped for,
but I'm just pumped to get everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already been 50 episodes,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was just talking about that with
them today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when you really keep track of them
and put a number to them, it hurts.
[SPEAKER_02]: You realize how far it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes so quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every week I do an episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done a couple of episodes,
uh, weeks where I've done multiple
[SPEAKER_03]: episodes too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to be able to do that,
but I feel like I bore the people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have enough content.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just me rambling.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I do two episodes, it's kind of a big
dab for you, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might, we might need to get you some of
that floria after this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pumped for the crowd.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like all these people gatherings.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's usually two people you enjoy and 13
people that like you tolerate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if, if the guest list for 50 shows up
and everyone's here, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, well they set the date.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spence and Maddie were the ones that said
when we're doing this, what the hell is
[SPEAKER_03]: that?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw Adam hitting the rig and I heard
that noise.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, what the fuck just happened?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you got some claim on you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that burn?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not after a long day of work.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a light coating of hot metal
shavings over most of his hands.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You probably pick them right here in front
of my hair.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's on mic.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as it doesn't involve anything
with me putting my hands over my head,
[SPEAKER_03]: it can burn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the worst part of your guys' job
from what I've heard is hanging drywall
[SPEAKER_03]: and metal beams above your head all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing anything above your head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone just went silent after that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm totally down to carry soil or water or
whatever because it's below my waist.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no more ceiling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, at the new grow at the spot,
there's no like carrying.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are carts.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know the janitor cart?
[SPEAKER_03]: I got one of those for all my shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just push it around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they'll be there eventually.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm so excited to have upgraded from
my smaller facilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my first grows was in my mom's
basement in the closet in a grow hut,
[SPEAKER_03]: in a little tiny, tiny.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I've got- Five gallon bucket of
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's all it took.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bathtub upstairs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flush the plants by carrying them to the
bathtub and just rinse them out a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are you guys getting that oil on you
from?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's it coming from on there?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll clean it up if you can identify the
leak.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's just coming out of the carb
cap, honestly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably is the carb cap now that you say
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything over here is just dirty.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to- Dirty?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I cleaned yours the other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need a cleaner monkey that just walks
around behind me and cleans up after me
[SPEAKER_03]: all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me tell you people, if you think you
smoke a lot of dabs, there's fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: reclaim coming off the end of the torch
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got five oil slick pads on the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all just stained to shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all stuck together.
[SPEAKER_03]: The carb cap's sitting right in the middle
of the table, just sitting there.
[SPEAKER_03]: A non-picky person could get dabbed the
fuck out off the claim stuck to my oil
[SPEAKER_03]: slick pads.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had someone ask me for the reclaim in my
work rig the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty substantial.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a cheap little rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as I can suck through it,
it's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never even considered it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just mix that shit with formula 420 or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just get it right out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen a lot of people make edibles out
of the reclaim.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's gross.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't sound nasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: All this BHO talk leads me right into this
news article.
[SPEAKER_03]: That I was attempting to read,
so that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to hear a couple of weird
breaths from me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can feel my nose trying to run.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, a court hearing Wednesday to
determine the legal status of marijuana
[SPEAKER_03]: hash oil in post-legislation Colorado
resulted in the judge turning up his hands
[SPEAKER_03]: and shrugging his shoulders in
exasperation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike's pulling out his phone to take a
picture of me because I got this big wad
[SPEAKER_03]: of toilet paper stuffed in my nose while
I'm doing a podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't, but now I'm going to.
[SPEAKER_03]: The nasal tampon.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hearing in Denver district court was
to decide whether a man named Paul
[SPEAKER_03]: Maneone, Maneone?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maneone.
[SPEAKER_03]: If this guy Paul, who was one of the three
people charged after an explosion at a
[SPEAKER_03]: Southwest Denver warehouse can be
prosecuted for the crime of manufacturing
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana concentrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: The man's attorney, Rob Corey,
who helped write Colorado's marijuana
[SPEAKER_03]: legalization law said Maneone can't be
charged because of Colorado's constitution
[SPEAKER_03]: now protects the personal possession of
marijuana and the processing of marijuana
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: The court system is not to be used for
marijuana regulation anymore, Corey said.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish he would have said cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would have made it a lot better.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Colorado attorney general argues
Maneone can be charged because by virtue
[SPEAKER_03]: of a curiously placed comma in amendment
64, the legalization measure, the
[SPEAKER_03]: protection for marijuana does not cover
cannabis oil like hash oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: The measure says its definition for
marijuana does not include industrial
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp, nor does it include fiber produced
from the stocks, oil, or cake made from
[SPEAKER_03]: the seeds of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: The attorney general's office,
which weighed in on Maneone's case,
[SPEAKER_03]: even though it is not prosecuting the
case, has made a similar argument in a
[SPEAKER_03]: case in Mesa County.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the end of Wednesday's hearing,
Denver district judge a Bruce Jones had
[SPEAKER_03]: concluded both sides were wrong,
though it was still unclear how he would
[SPEAKER_03]: ultimately rule.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jones said he plans to deny Corey's motion
to drop the charge, meaning the case
[SPEAKER_03]: against Maneone can proceed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's kind of we're getting into the
part where it's all technical.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hash oil is the potent goop left over
after marijuana's active chemicals are
[SPEAKER_03]: dissolved from the underlying plant
material.
[SPEAKER_03]: That guy tried real hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: He tried hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hash oil is the hash that we want.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone involved in this story and this
article is at best trying hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody succeeded.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cannabis often tries really hard,
but they need somebody.
[SPEAKER_03]: They need a guy like you, Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should contact the cannabis and be
like, hey, you guys say a lot of dumb
[SPEAKER_03]: shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: They tell their stories right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing is inaccurate here except the
wording.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hash oil is the potent goop left over
after marijuana's active chemicals are
[SPEAKER_03]: dissolved.
[SPEAKER_04]: The sentence in question in the bill is
about hemp seed oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you take hemp seed and you gather it up
and you press it, sort of like you do
[SPEAKER_04]: grapes to make wine, you get an oil that
you can make everything you can make with
[SPEAKER_04]: oil, oil, like Texans haul out of the
ground oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what they're referencing in
that part of the bill.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hash oil isn't oil, oil or cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just call it oil because it kind of
looks like it's honey oil when it comes
[SPEAKER_04]: out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love watching it drip over a descriptive
slang term.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because that's what I keep thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, it's not really an oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: The judge isn't going to drop the case
because I'm pretty sure this fucking up
[SPEAKER_04]: blew up his house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's more to the story.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me read part of that in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Blowing up your house has long been a
crime in Colorado that was not legalized
[SPEAKER_04]: at any time recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's something that Rob Corey
mentions and I'm going to have an argument
[SPEAKER_03]: later on in the story.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you agree with me now.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like forward thinking people.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have to sit in the back seat of
our minds and fucking let everybody else
[SPEAKER_03]: drive us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hash oil, they describe it wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it says a popular amateur
production method uses compressed butane
[SPEAKER_03]: gas, which can lead to dangerous
explosions like the one that rocked the
[SPEAKER_03]: 1200 block of South Lippen Street last
April.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mannione is also charged with arson in
connection with that blast.
[SPEAKER_03]: During Wednesday's hearing, Corey argued
that home hash oil explosions are
[SPEAKER_03]: mistakes, but not illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I compare it to frying a turkey,
Corey said.
[SPEAKER_03]: Accidents don't mean a crime has occurred.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jones didn't seem impressed, calling some
of Corey's arguments circular,
[SPEAKER_03]: but Jones also criticized an attorney
general's position.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to tell him he's wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to tell him he's way wrong,
Jones said.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he compared it to if I'm cooking a
chicken and I burn the apartment building
[SPEAKER_03]: down or a turkey, then I made a mistake.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think I'm still recklessly
endangering people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think charges are going to be
pressed on me even if I do burn down my
[SPEAKER_03]: apartment building, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're frying a turkey in the living
room of your apartment, you're A,
[SPEAKER_04]: an idiot, B, violating the fire guard.
[SPEAKER_04]: What if I'm doing it in the kitchen?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, the kitchen too.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to fry a turkey,
you got to take that shit outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: What if I'm just cooking dinner?
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm cooking dinner in the kitchen and
I'm just cooking normal food.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got veggie burgers and some fucking
vegetables and some rice and some macaroni
[SPEAKER_03]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I fucking, I take a dab and I come
back and the kitchen's on fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boosh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I going to face charges?
[SPEAKER_03]: For something now?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, as long as you were just, it was
innocent.
[SPEAKER_04]: You might be legally liable for damages or
something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of that depends on where you are at
the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Mike's not a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just stated a Holiday Inn Express last
night.
[SPEAKER_04]: That part of Corey's argument here is
correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that doesn't apply to butane hash oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're venting cans of flammable gas into
an enclosed space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is actually an OSHA crime,
I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a special thing in the fire code
for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I asked the fire chief down here,
because Pueblo outlawed making a BHO a
[SPEAKER_04]: while ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when the vote passed, right after it
passed, I stood up and walked back to the
[SPEAKER_04]: fire chief and jokingly asked,
venting cans of butane into your living
[SPEAKER_04]: room and lighting a match has been illegal
for how long?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he chuckled and went, longer than I've
been on the job?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's a thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't dump gasoline around your
apartment and light a match.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're venting cans of butane
inside, you're venting cans of flammable
[SPEAKER_04]: gas into an enclosed space.
[SPEAKER_04]: If your pilot light kicks on, your
eyebrows are kicking off.
[SPEAKER_04]: All your windows are kicking out and
you're going to the burn unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the burn and not the good burn unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's not a special charge for...
Well, yeah, there used to be a place we
[SPEAKER_03]: called the burn units where we used to go
burn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some kind of endangerment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard a dub band once called burn unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to finish the article.
[SPEAKER_03]: Caught almost on the sidelines was the
Denver district attorney's office,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is actually prosecuting the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: A deputy district attorney said the hash
oil qualifies as pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he said there's a difference between
amendment 64's protection for processing
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana and the state laws for
criminalizing of manufacturing
[SPEAKER_03]: concentrated marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jones is expected to issue his ruling in
the coming weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're saying that there's a major
difference between processing,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is properly doing that shit in a
facility, in a tested, authorized,
[SPEAKER_03]: MED approved lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's also been state regulated by the
health department.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's like seven different agencies
that want to come in and inspect your shit
[SPEAKER_03]: if you're growing and making concentrates.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then manufacturing concentrated
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was doing that at his house,
open blasting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's where the change
happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess the point is, don't fucking
blast indoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't open blast.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to blast, get a closed
loop and you can still fuck up,
[SPEAKER_03]: do that safely.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's yet to be a news story about
someone hurting themselves, making BHO
[SPEAKER_04]: outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those news stories don't happen because
people don't get hurt that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of a good point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just take it to your backyard,
numb nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone I know that's never blown
themselves up does it that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of those things where it's not
complicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was taught how to make my extracts
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty much, I knew that already,
but they're like, you always do this
[SPEAKER_03]: outside, was the first thing they said.
[SPEAKER_04]: Step one, check the weather.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there's any other news that
we should talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something's weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone blew up a house with alcohol here
in Pueblo the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's hilarious in a certain way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one of the largest alcohol.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were on one of the routes for the
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a huge prohibition town.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have tunnels under this town where
people used to move alcohol from private
[SPEAKER_03]: houses where it was made to clubs,
downtown.
[SPEAKER_03]: It scares me to death.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why does it scares you, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: My kids are going to grow up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: My kids are wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to find that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have found that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have found that shit real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not hidden, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're closed up now.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're mostly closed up.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I lived in a house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are different tunnels.
[SPEAKER_03]: I lived in a house in an area.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know if I should talk about
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a part of town called Goat Hill.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many years ago, I don't remember the exact
year, so I don't want to be wrong and try
[SPEAKER_03]: to say I have an idea in my head,
but many years ago, this town flooded up
[SPEAKER_03]: to the third story window of a lot of
buildings downtown.
[SPEAKER_01]: 1916, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could have been.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll agree with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That way, Jesse could be wrong and I
won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say 1929, but I really have
no idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: A long time ago, when the picture pictures
were yellow.
[SPEAKER_03]: When they took pictures of shit,
everything was yellow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That time, 44.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could have been.
[SPEAKER_03]: This town flooded.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a hill.
[SPEAKER_03]: It used to be First Street.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's fucking Center City Drive or some
dumb shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: City Center Drive.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so dumb.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's First Street, bitches.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why'd you change that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right up there, there was a hill and it
was called Goat Hill.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where allegedly all of the Italians
that lived here went and moved to that top
[SPEAKER_03]: of the hill and took all their livestock
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had goats up there and that part of
town became known as Goat Hill.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my house, I had a hatch that lifted up
in my bedroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could lift up that and you'd end up in
a hidden basement part.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then there was definitely a hole that had
been bricked over.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure that that hole was part of
those tunnels.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I was in a band that did a show at
the Damon Runyon Theater downtown,
[SPEAKER_03]: which used to be the chief.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go to one of the little back areas
by the kitchen, there's a tunnel that's
[SPEAKER_03]: blocked off and the security guard
wouldn't let me go past that area.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just in the opening band and he's
like, you can't go back here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I'm in the band.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, you can't go back here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, all right, I tried.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those tunnels used to be used.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet that tunnel and the tunnel I found
connect somewhere, somehow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably this.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hooch was made at the top of the hill,
up on Goat Hill.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it was ran and money probably.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to know why Pueblo has people
in it, you can watch two documentaries on
[SPEAKER_04]: Netflix.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them is Prohibition and the other
one is The Great Dust Bowl.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ken Burns is amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ken Burns is the shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm writing those down to watch them
again.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you watch both of those, Pueblo makes
perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of stuff here where people
that move here are like, what's with that?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a question they ask a bunch their
first year and the answer is either
[SPEAKER_04]: Prohibition or the Dust Bowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: This town is old school.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a stop on the Santa Fe Trail.
[SPEAKER_03]: This used to be called Little Chicago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three rivers meet here, going all
different directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Between here and the county.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two major highways meet here now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we get a lot of weird shit here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got Highway 50 going east and west all
the way across the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: I-25 goes north and south almost all the
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Canada, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Might stop somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of weird rambles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take that shit to El Paso, Texas.
[SPEAKER_03]: What even got us on that weird rant?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: This weird rant was brought to you by
Dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to the Garden of Wheaton.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it when I see those little
envelopes.
[SPEAKER_04]: My smile goes from big to just ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their new packaging is definitely stylish.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys made me feel a lot better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming over and making me snap
out of my funk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been moping around all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did get a little bit of work done.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been talking about the black cherry
chem fino hunt that I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how much I talk about it on
the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I sprouted 40 seeds and 35 of them made it
to the flower room, which is actually
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_03]: When that many of them make it all the way
to flower, that means that there were
[SPEAKER_03]: five.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember exactly, but some didn't
germinate, some were runt, and then some I
[SPEAKER_03]: just didn't feel like they were worth the
space.
[SPEAKER_03]: 35 of them made it to flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today I moved 11 of them into another room
because they are males.
[SPEAKER_03]: My goal is to find a purple male and a
green male.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully the light went off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to go check that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was supposed to go off at nine.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're in a new room.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got started tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see how that worked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully I find a purple male and a green
male.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully I find a purple female and a
green female.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to collect pollen and cube
things and see if I can't make F2s that
[SPEAKER_03]: come out consistently purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to work them to F5, honestly.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds ridiculous, but I want to work
them to F5 to where they're purple clones
[SPEAKER_03]: of each other when they come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that problem we're having with
that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If something ever happens, I can't get it
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel you, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strong shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure what any of that meant,
but that's why we bring out- I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I just rant and rave.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody else did either.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all- This rant has been brought to
you by forced labor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so used to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know anything was strange for
about 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike's done immune to it now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're working together and he turns around
and glares at me.
[SPEAKER_04]: 30 seconds later he turns around and
glares again.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like a black Larry Berg.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so got to be awesomely out of
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not me, by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Way across the room, perfectly into the
trashcan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: Practice, practice.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a three pointer for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam's an asshole.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think you're an asshole.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love how spontaneous and untamed you
are.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no filter.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no filter.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give him a tape measure and a stack of
aluminum framing studs and just let him go
[SPEAKER_04]: to where he can steal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like taking him to a restaurant where
there's more than five ingredients on
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: My hand doesn't work anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: They take me to fucking like Hotel Jota,
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_02]: They take me in there like, what do you
want?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, everything's in Spanish.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_02]: Tacos, I guess?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that say hamburger?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take you, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not getting a hamburger here,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: We forget he's not from Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how quickly he's gotten into the
group.
[SPEAKER_02]: I told him all the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I told him all the other day, like I'm
screw McDonald's and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm, we haven't ate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we get Subway every now and
then, but just because it's right there,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know, you got to have a little GMO
in your life or else.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit of yoga mat bread.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I guarantee you the food at the
Mexican place is chock full.
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't 80 cents.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to tell you how much right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you take him?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they didn't speak English.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time, the first time me and Fish
went in there, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even the first one to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, three chicken tacos for three bucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different kinds of Mexican food
places.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's three taco stops on that street.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nah, I'm jealous.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want good tacos.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pueblo style Mexican, which is like taco
casa and a taco stop and burritos beddies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where you get green chili and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you got like the actual Mexicano
Mexican street tacos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and if you tell them you want green
chili, you get green chilies diced.
[SPEAKER_03]: What about the guy that carries around the
cooler and he goes burritos?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those dudes are fucking awesome,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I worked at guitar center,
there was a little lady that used to come
[SPEAKER_03]: in all the time with the burritos.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody would buy those.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't buy, I'm a vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty strict about what I'll eat,
but those guys would buy the burritos.
[SPEAKER_03]: And about 30 minutes later, then I'll have
to go take a fat dump.
[SPEAKER_03]: You couldn't find it all the time,
but they're like, they're so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but you're dying in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucker.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one chick and her son.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I see her, I'm like,
I've been buying them since I worked
[SPEAKER_01]: construction 12 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, yeah, what do you got?
[SPEAKER_01]: They always have a little fried stuff,
so papillas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I know who you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: They used to go to the pixie.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to be in the house band at the
pixie and they'd show up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her son always goes to the bar.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still got this Kleenex in my nose and it
feels so weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all soggy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sort of impressed it's still there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's so soggy, it's not going
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did it swell up?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it did.
[SPEAKER_03]: It puffed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it for a light day or a heavy day?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's for a medium flow.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so I'm doing that black cherry
fino hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got five black cherries right now,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, I'll tell you later.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're actually kind of old, especially
for their size.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Nano Lux love is, they're taking the
fuck off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys, we're going to have a lot of cool
prizes on episode 50.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hoping, I was just listening to the
banter that was happening on the show with
[SPEAKER_03]: four of us and with six people happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to come up with some contest if
you guys got any ideas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some contests?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A way to give away all the cool prizes
that we've got.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we've got a couple of cool ideas.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to number the prize pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: The biggest one will be number one and
we'll work our way down to the smaller
[SPEAKER_03]: prizes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be number five and then we'll do
some sort of contest and whoever does
[SPEAKER_03]: better at the contest will win a place in
the pricing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we'll let you ask for which prize
you want so that you don't want a t-shirt
[SPEAKER_03]: or you want a t-shirt and you win a
fucking ballast.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you live in Florida and it can't grow
and all you wanted was an Irish shirt and
[SPEAKER_03]: we send you something cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you've got a $300 bulb.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to try not to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feeding nutrients to the ornamental plants
in the apartment complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: My azaleas really took off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Felt all that botanic care and grow kashi
to that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're definitely going to have to get
together right before the show a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit and talk about what we're giving away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd never win it, but if I wasn't one of
the dudes sitting at the table,
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, but I'm just saying I'd never win
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you now, if I try,
it's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to have to be some rules,
huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you put down the show, then I guess you
can't win.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just sitting here thinking there's
some stuff in that box that I would fully
[SPEAKER_04]: be like, I'm sick and I'd go home and play
like create new username.
[SPEAKER_04]: Long time listener, first time caller.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also doing a lemon Jeffrey cross to
the grateful dog Fino hunt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, those look amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got five of them in there and they
look two of us in the room that just went,
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen, uh, I got somebody else growing
it and it, no, they're not growing that
[SPEAKER_03]: one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're growing that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So many projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've sent so many seeds to so many
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, yeah, guys, I was promising more
seeds, nature's green remedies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, uh, I might've fucked up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't make enough seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I seriously didn't make enough seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: All my friends, all my locals are sucking
up all the seeds that I made.
[SPEAKER_03]: And honestly, uh, I'm going to get my crew
around here seeds before I mail a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: shit out to a distributor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just seems like grow from the heart is
my, my name on my show.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been my motto for years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and I feel like my community is right
here and I don't need to go sending stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: out to somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps you produce a better product.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I get to see clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get to go to these people's gardens.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get to see what's happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, guys, you'll get seeds from me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I promise.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always making more.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Jesse's on the team now.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's making more.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got breeding space somewhere else
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I promise I'm always making more.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just hard to keep up, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are hungry for the seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I apologize.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I do what I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's, yeah, it's hard to,
I've been wanting seeds since I've been
[SPEAKER_02]: here and I've just never had money at the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he's like, look at all these
seeds, get a whole table full seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, so which ones do you want?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, uh, the, the, the ones that
you're throwing away over there would be
[SPEAKER_02]: cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the ruts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'll get one of those to sprout,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is kind of a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm, we know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've done it enough, but getting your
male started.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if I put three or four or four or
five females in the room with that male,
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes they have to go into flower four
or five, six or seven, eight or 10 days
[SPEAKER_03]: apart from each other to time up when the
females are ovulating to take that pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And different males dump at different
times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, what I did, I'll admit this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I make my own silver thiosulfate and I
tried a new method and I over applied and
[SPEAKER_03]: my male plants turned male super quick,
uh, quicker than I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, they didn't make any
pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: They made some, but not nearly as much as
I had anticipated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not what I'm used to.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got about a quarter amount of the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I expected to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a man enough to say that on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't fucked up y'all, but I learned
from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know not to do that again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real life mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also a high level mistake too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're making that, you know,
yeah, I'm not even, I don't think you're
[SPEAKER_01]: beating yourself up.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I know not to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I over learned.
[SPEAKER_03]: I sprayed too many times and, uh,
I made it too strong and sprayed too many
[SPEAKER_03]: times.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're back to the number of sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember the issue you were going
through and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well it worked.
[SPEAKER_03]: I solved that issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Created a whole new mess of problems for
myself doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't spray your hash with a torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, we're all learning shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't learn or if you don't fuck
up, you don't learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm, I think I taught you
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I've said that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I taught you that,
but I know everybody's taught me that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Life has taught me that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I fucked up on a big scale,
like I was going big and I kind of ruined
[SPEAKER_03]: some shit by doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we all do.
[SPEAKER_03]: It made a lot of good hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those plants that did not get seeded made
a hell of a lot of good hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that works.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hooray.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody get your cannabis cup tickets.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Denver cannabis cup is coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am not endorsed by high times.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not paid to say this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to see you guys there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will not have a booth, but I will be
cruising around having fun saying what's
[SPEAKER_03]: up to people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I plan on being there all three days most
likely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Should we all just rent a van?
[SPEAKER_02]: In a house?
[SPEAKER_02]: A house would be cool, but we're all meat
eaters.
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll be like, you guys stink.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a whole bunch of us that want to
go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, well I've got my tickets.
[SPEAKER_04]: I may be into that option.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheap people for life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to a motel with my wife.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll hump on the couch.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: I usually do a pretty good hotel for those
kinds of events.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm there for three days, I want some
luxury.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how we do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somewhere with a balcony.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can open that balcony door there,
the sliding glass door, and chill out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: This sounds like I'm going to be working a
booth for someone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I think I know who you're working
with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me know about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could use some wristbands.
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard something about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just thinking the same thing,
boss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do what I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have wristbands that we'll be able to
trade out for another event.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you'll be very interested in
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's before the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's something coming up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I need to grow a fat crop or something?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before April?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an accessories event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone's going, huh, over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get your Cannabis Cup tickets so that we
can all hang out and have fun there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be a mooch like him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't try to suck up wristbands from the
vendors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to MedCampCup.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: The tickets right now, what I bought was a
three day early bird special for like 85
[SPEAKER_03]: bucks plus a $5.50 service fucking stick
it in your butt fee.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does not include any concert tickets
because I actually plan on seeing Doug
[SPEAKER_03]: Benson.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a ticket to see Doug Benson on
420 at ComedyWorks at nine o'clock.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not going to the Snoop Dogg concert
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that sounds weak, but Doug Benson
is actually a friend of mine and it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: comedy taping.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my favorite comedians taping their
new comedy special at my favorite comedy
[SPEAKER_03]: club in the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: On our holiday.
[SPEAKER_03]: On 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll even say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The High Times concerts aren't that cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just, they're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: You kind of reach an age where a concert
is just like, it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you love to see them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're outdoors in April in Colorado and
you don't know what you're getting into.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take shorts and a parka.
[SPEAKER_03]: We saw, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: We saw slight, we wear shorts all day
because at the cup it's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're rocking shorts and a t-shirt and
then you get in the car and you go eat
[SPEAKER_03]: dinner and you go to the hotel and you got
to change into like pants and long sleeves
[SPEAKER_03]: and a hoodie and put some chapstick on
your lips.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause we went out to Red Rocks for
Slightly Stupid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not dissing the shows you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: We went out to Red Rocks and it was so
windy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go see Slightly Stupid at Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just not on 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never heard anyone say, don't,
yeah, I wouldn't go see them at Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody seen anybody at Red Rocks?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: January 30th at Red Rocks is Damien Marley
and a couple of other bands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are going to freeze our dicks off
out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought they shut that bitch down.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they're just doing shows out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: January 30th at Red Rocks, Damien and
someone else.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damien's from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe out there in a parka.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's some sort of evil joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just had a whole bunch of cool running.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably coinciding with that X
Games shit or something else going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know for sure, but I would just
assume since that's the way events like to
[SPEAKER_03]: do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They piggyback on each other just to make
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they make it seem like it's just a
nice casual trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably going to a heated stage by now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the heated stage out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, Red Rocks is treacherous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you imagine all the fucking ice
demelter shit they're going to have to
[SPEAKER_01]: spray all over that fucking entire
concrete surface.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the muddy parking lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take one slip at the top and in all the
way at the fucking parking lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm going to see Ari Shaffir at
ComedyWorks on that day on the 30th,
[SPEAKER_03]: January 30th, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't talked to my buddy about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been kind of, he's working nights
now and I'm on this weird random podcast
[SPEAKER_03]: life schedule.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I might be going to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're listening to this, message me.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see if we're doing that and we'll
see if there's room for one more in the
[SPEAKER_03]: car or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have anything going on at the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just told him the other day that he
should come with us to Doug Benson,
[SPEAKER_02]: but he's like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got his wife there, you know,
spending the weekend and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, she can stay at home with the
kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about my wife, not yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: My wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: My wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally lost my train of thought with that
earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to talk to somebody about
something and I was like, as soon as I
[SPEAKER_02]: said it, it stopped and I was like,
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to say it before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, all right, now where was I?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: People with ADD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody got any plugs to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Any shout outs or anything?

taking care of business.
