[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, what's up, Podcast World?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 448 of the Grow
From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds in your garden,
I highly recommend Seeds Here Now,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can find them at www.seedsherenow
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start this podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Tahoe Jam
fambrosia from our friends at Apothecary
[SPEAKER_00]: Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of Tahoe, OG, and Jam
Band.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aroma is really funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm cracking it open right now to get a
fresh smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a immediately a gassy,
dirty aroma right off the crack of the
[SPEAKER_00]: jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I open it, there is a gassy
smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is a rotten fruit sort of a
thing on the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is gassy and gross all at the
same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It coats your mouth so deliciously.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency label says this product
contains 72.9% THC and 84.9% total
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the Tahoe Jam fambrosia from
our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to all of my friends over
at Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be
a quick Thursday episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an email from a friend that I
want to read, so let's not waste a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, I found you
through the Embracing Organics show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to keep people up to speed,
I am part of another podcast called
[SPEAKER_00]: Embracing Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That show is on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens live every Thursday at 7 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain Time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is hosted by my good friend Dirtman
Dan.
[SPEAKER_00]: He invites me as a panelist.
[SPEAKER_00]: That show is mainly based on organically
growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm not much of an organic farmer,
but I do have plenty of opportunities to
[SPEAKER_00]: give a lot of good insight in that
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk a lot about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I invite you to join us on the
Embracing Organics show Thursdays on
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube at 7 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain Time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure your time zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that I've got to be there at 7.
[SPEAKER_00]: So find out what time 7 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain Time is in your time zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join us on Thursdays for the Embracing
Organics live show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you missed the show, all of the
episodes are still available on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go to YouTube, type in Embracing
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find an episode I'm sure you will
enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am a guest on the Embracing Organics
show every Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is where our friend found me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on to say, I found you via Stabby
McStaberson, who spoke highly of your work
[SPEAKER_00]: and made me curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, big shout out to my friend Stabby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stabby is a great person, a great dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is also a panelist on the Embracing
Organics show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have become quite good friends lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's good to hear that Stabby is
speaking well of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the message goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I don't have money to support you
on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or buy your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would like to support by giving some
grow tips of my own, which I have picked
[SPEAKER_00]: up and I felt could help you out if you
have not heard them yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my new friend here wants to support the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is not in a position to financially
contribute to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is not in a situation where he needs
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he is doing his giving back by sending
us some useful advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I would share this advice with
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here are some tips sent in by our
friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tip number one is, Swarovski predator
mites can get expensive and need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: reapplied.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk quite often about using Swarovski
predator mites as part of my integrated
[SPEAKER_00]: pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they do need to be reapplied.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does take some time to establish
colonies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This email comes with some great advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, If you grow banker plants or
companion plants, such as poinsettias,
[SPEAKER_00]: and place a few between each plant in the
veg and flower room, the Swarovskis will
[SPEAKER_00]: feed on the pollen from the pepper plants
until your bad bugs arrive or return.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have released Swarovskis in your
grow, eventually they are going to eat all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the bad mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, in theory, they're going to get
in there and they are going to eradicate
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the intrusive spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point in time, those Swarovskis
will go, Hey, there's nothing here for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like you, they're going to want
to eat and they're going to want to get
[SPEAKER_00]: laid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going to leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to go find a better
opportunity to eat and get laid.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have some poinsettia or pepper
plants in your grow, those Swarovskis can
[SPEAKER_00]: feed off of the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they will have something to survive off
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't need bad bugs in your
situation, in your environment to continue
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep the populations of Swarovskis
colonized in your facility or in your
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a very useful tip if you are
trying to establish and keep colonies of
[SPEAKER_00]: Swarovskis around in your facility or in
your outdoor grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some poinsettias or some pepper plants
will help them stick around because they
[SPEAKER_00]: can simply feed off of that pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this email continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, I learned this from Psych Angel
on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Psych Angel is an IPM specialist and
an entomologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, I've seen my buddy's garden
effectively maintaining his Swarovski
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he also says, female Swarovskis
produce three times more when on a pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll be able to increase your
population quite quickly if you are
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding them the proper pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, the poinsettias make
copious amounts of pollen, which you
[SPEAKER_00]: probably already know, peppers won't
pollinate cannabis plants and keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: good bugs around, sort of like a barracks
of soldiers waiting to deploy when the bad
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs come around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollen from the poinsettias cannot
pollinate your cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not anything to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure somebody was thinking that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you corrected that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then yes, you were correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we've got a barracks of soldiers
waiting to deploy for when the bad bugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: if the bad bugs do decide to come back
around, then we don't need to worry about
[SPEAKER_00]: building our population.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is already there, ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the troops all lined up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just waiting for the signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just waiting for the little bell
so they could slide down the pole like
[SPEAKER_00]: firemen and just get out there and start
destroying shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps on going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Swarovskis are an excellent
generalist and will actually eat nearly
[SPEAKER_00]: all cannabis pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is why I like the Swarovskis in
almost all commercial grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use them outside in some environments
and I even use them in small caregiver
[SPEAKER_00]: personal private grow situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big thank you for Grow Tip number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys out there would like to keep
your Swarovski populations up,
[SPEAKER_00]: this person recommends adding a poinsettia
plant to the room and letting it
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those Swarovskis can live off of that
pollen while the bad bugs are sparse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's move on to Grow Tip number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says,
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I germinate seeds, I recommend
folding a paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You fold it once, you fold it twice,
maybe once more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you soak it with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I unfold it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put the seeds about in the center of
that and I fold it all back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I will either set that on a plate
in a room where I can pay attention to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if I'm leaving, I will put it in a
baggie and seal the baggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: The purpose for putting it in the baggie
and sealing it is now I have kept the
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That moisture can't disappear if I'm gone
for longer than expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds will not dry up and die.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked on a previous episode about
how my stoned ass germinated a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive seeds, went to work,
came home, went to bed, woke up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of the night and realized I just
killed a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had I put them in a baggie, that probably
would not have happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to fold a paper towel,
soak the paper towel, either put it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: baggie or put it on a plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to unfold that paper towel every
12, 8 hours or so and check on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if I've got any tails coming out of my
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, those seeds will sprout
within 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start making little tails.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll look like a little sperm or a
little worm and they'll start growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you get a dud and it just
doesn't crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy says that you can use a seed
cracker or you can also use scissors or a
[SPEAKER_00]: pair of mechanical hemostats to squeeze
the seed until it pops the shell but no
[SPEAKER_00]: further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now to be completely honest with you,
I do not have any experience using a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: cracker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any time a seed has not germinated for me,
I've thrown it away and called a dud and
[SPEAKER_00]: sprouted a new seed and hoped that that
one worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds can be very delicate but if you've
already tried to soak it for 48 hours and
[SPEAKER_00]: it did not germinate, you don't have much
to lose by giving it another shot by using
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of a cracking method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he says once the shells cracked,
I've had 100% germination rate since
[SPEAKER_00]: trying the seed cracker.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also says, I saw a member of Coastal
Seeds pop some 40-year-old seeds with the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed cracker.
[SPEAKER_00]: May not need to throw un-germ seeds out
and start over if they don't pop right
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be like a second chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do your method for germinating
seeds however you do it, if you soak them,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you put them in a paper towel,
if you put them in a rapid router,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you just bury them straight in the dirt
and it doesn't work, you can dig it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take it out of the paper towel and
this is another last ditch attempt to
[SPEAKER_00]: getting that seed to pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I wouldn't personally do this or
recommend this until it's been at least 48
[SPEAKER_00]: or 52 or 60 something hours and you're
sure that that seed isn't going to pop
[SPEAKER_00]: under your normal method.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would make sure that that seed has been
properly moistened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would make sure that it's not too cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cold seeds won't sprout.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's a little bit too cold,
it won't do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you make it warm enough, it should
sprout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now it's the middle of the summer so
it's not real cold so I would just
[SPEAKER_00]: germinate my seeds here on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would fold the paper towel up,
I would soak it, put the seeds in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe put it in the baggie, maybe not
depending on my schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would just germinate those seeds
right here at the table right where I hang
[SPEAKER_00]: out so I could check on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't forget about them and they'd be
just right here part of my normal day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it were the colder season and I
couldn't keep the house warm like it is
[SPEAKER_00]: now, I would put that baggie with those
seeds on top of my refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that heat from the top of the
refrigerator is just enough heat to
[SPEAKER_00]: germinate seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any warmer than that and you run the risk
of burning those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen more people just roast seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen more people make popcorn out of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen more people just kill seeds with
a heat mat with some sort of a heat source
[SPEAKER_00]: than I have seen success with a heat mat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't recommend that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will ruin your seeds unless it is
really cold in your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also don't like to pop seeds in a
humidity dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like the dome on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that makes them a little bit weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to have them exposed as soon as
they are growing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way they can get some wind on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way they're not expecting a bunch of
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you germinate a seed in a dome,
it's expecting that dome condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have to slowly acclimate that
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to let it realize, oh,
I'm not going to have a dome for 15
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes and the next day you give it 30
minutes and you let it go for a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: days and then you give it an hour and then
you give it two hours and then finally
[SPEAKER_00]: it's used to not having a dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't like starting a seed under a
dome because then it expects it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not just start it in your normal grow
environment where you've got the proper
[SPEAKER_00]: VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a little bit of airflow going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bit of wind in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That airflow, that wind happening will
give that plant some strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just imagine when I push you if I just
gently walked by you and shoved you by
[SPEAKER_00]: your shoulder, just as a buddy,
not as an asshole, just nudged you on your
[SPEAKER_00]: shoulder, just jokingly, what's up,
bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: A little shoulder nudge.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing you do, you spread your
feet so that you can get better balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like when we blow on a small plant,
just a little bit of wind, it tips over a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit and it goes, oh shit,
I better get my footing and I think it
[SPEAKER_00]: tries to reach out and it spreads its
roots a little bit further and it makes it
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a little bit of a struggle makes
everything stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a plant, if it's a person,
anything, a little bit of adversity,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little struggle, what happens when you
lift weights?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do some work, you come back
stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the plants respond the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't like starting my plants in a
dome and I certainly do not like starting
[SPEAKER_00]: my plants with a heat mat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer the paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer the baggie and I prefer the top
of the refrigerator if I'm going to use
[SPEAKER_00]: any heat at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do your best to set yourself up for
success when you are germinating new or
[SPEAKER_00]: old seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find that your method does not
work, you've got a backup plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can crack them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were some of the ways that our friend
mentioned we could crack them?
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a product called a seed cracker
you can buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also said we can use a small pair of
medical hemostats to gently squeeze the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed until it pops, but no further.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also said you can use scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use scissors, it is probably easier
to use the part of the scissors closer to
[SPEAKER_00]: the handle than closer to the tip of the
blade.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just a thing about leverage closer
to the handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have a little more
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be easier to pop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So open the scissors real wide,
put your seed down in there close to the
[SPEAKER_00]: handle, then gently squeeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll feel a little crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't take much pressure at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, you'll feel a little pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that seed has another chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go back, try to re germinate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should sprout.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if not, that seed did not stand a
chance in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got another option.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to thank you for that great tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says that is it for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have posted these in an update,
so I apologize if you have covered either
[SPEAKER_00]: topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I have not.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were great topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for the great tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, I am about halfway through part
three of the Grow Tip compilation
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes, and I wanted to write the email
before I forgot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you for listening to that long
grow series and thank you for sending the
[SPEAKER_00]: email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that by the time this podcast comes
up, you were all caught up so you get to
[SPEAKER_00]: hear this right when it comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is just a little bit more to this
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, love what you do and really enjoy
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I've been cultivating for over a
decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like listening to your grow tips as I
can always learn something new even when
[SPEAKER_00]: reviewing basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll always be pointing many new
growers to this playlist as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since it answers a lot of questions,
I get asked on Instagram on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's saying thanks for the podcast,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been growing for over a decade and
still learns things from this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was listening to somebody the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were paying me to do consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were paying me to give them advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said something that I said,
holy shit, I've never thought of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I pulled out my notebook and I just
casually wrote it down just in my little
[SPEAKER_00]: notebook that I have for consultations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like I was making a note on the
facility or something, but I was making a
[SPEAKER_00]: note on something profound that that
person had said that I had never said out
[SPEAKER_00]: loud or never thought of or never heard
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, oh, that's really good
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were paying me to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So never think that you can't learn
something from anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a brand new grower out there that
read a book that you didn't read in one
[SPEAKER_00]: sentence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You stood out to him and you didn't read
that book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's going to say that sentence one
day and you're going to go, holy shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: that person that I thought was stupid
knows some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So always keep an open mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend here has been growing for over
a decade and still finds nuggets of useful
[SPEAKER_00]: information in my little podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he mentions reviewing basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sometimes reviewing the basics is
very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've mentioned in a previous episode,
we had somebody with the grow room issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: They thought they needed a giant
consultation when all they really needed
[SPEAKER_00]: was to take some time and maybe buy a
small piece of equipment and find out what
[SPEAKER_00]: was happening in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yes, remember the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't build anything without a solid
foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't forget the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says he's going to share the
playlist with his friends and people on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram because he has asked questions
on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I get a lot of new listeners from
you and I hope I am able to help you and a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of your grow friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wraps up the message by saying,
thanks for all that you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the great work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've taken many, fat dabs and given my mom
lots of hugs for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is super cool of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He signs it with Jack Greenstock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, hey, Jack Greenstock, thank you for
the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like Jack has got a podcast
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you guys look for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give that one a listen as
soon as I am done with this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm circling that right here on this paper
and putting it right in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I remember to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, big shout out to my friend,
Jack Greenstock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for sharing the show with your
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening to the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more email right here in
front of me for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from, they've said their
name multiple times in the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to call them C because it
doesn't say if they want their name said
[SPEAKER_00]: or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, what's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is C and I'm from, yeah,
we're not going to say your name and your
[SPEAKER_00]: location, both.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our friend is from a place and he
says, I recently started growing with my
[SPEAKER_00]: dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a few plants right now that look
great and have turned out pretty well so
[SPEAKER_00]: far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked at a plant nursery for the
past few years and have always had a
[SPEAKER_00]: fascination with plants, specifically
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been listening to your podcast for
some time now and I have a few questions
[SPEAKER_00]: that hopefully you can answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I am currently studying business
and I would like to change my major to
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture and or agronomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What field of study would best fit someone
who is looking to pursue a career in
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivating cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, what steps did you take when you
first started breeding and cultivating
[SPEAKER_00]: that have brought you to the point where
you are right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to hear back from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the bomb ass podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, C.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friend C is currently studying
business and would like to change their
[SPEAKER_00]: major to agriculture or agronomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are seeking advice on what field
of study I think would best fit for
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody who is looking to pursue a career
in cultivating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a clear cut answer because
there are so many different aspects to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry that I think having your
business education will be more useful
[SPEAKER_00]: than any type of other education I could
recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a passion for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already got nursery experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you plan to enter a facility as an
owner or a lead grower, you were already
[SPEAKER_00]: on the right path.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got just enough experience in a
plant nursery and you've got a fascination
[SPEAKER_00]: for plants, specifically cannabis,
whereas a candidate for me to hire,
[SPEAKER_00]: that makes you a great starting grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the kind of person I want to put on
watering plants and I pay attention to if
[SPEAKER_00]: you can follow directions for a couple of
weeks and then I give you a few more
[SPEAKER_00]: tasks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sound like a smart person.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sound like you can handle that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trying to aim you or point you toward
the direction of an agriculture or an
[SPEAKER_00]: agronomy type of a school or an education
doesn't seem necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to learn that and pick that
up along the way by being there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the industry is lacking is business
minded people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds like you probably want to
get into the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably want to play with some dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably want to cut some plants and
pull some leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of those people available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, the pay rate for those
types of jobs is rapidly declining as the
[SPEAKER_00]: cost and price and value of cannabis
declines.
[SPEAKER_00]: As cannabis becomes more regulated and
more available, and you can just go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: store and get it anywhere around here,
it's getting much cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is much more affordable for the
consumer, but that means on the business
[SPEAKER_00]: end, there's no profit, which means the
growers are getting paid less.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people who are making the money are on
the management end, the consultants,
[SPEAKER_00]: the lead grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate the term master grower,
but that is just a name for the person in
[SPEAKER_00]: the building who is in charge of the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are growers and then there is a
master grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the lead grower, the cultivation
manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: That guy, he's the one making the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other people are grotechs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're paid as hourly employees,
but it's the management is where the money
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to make money in the
cannabis industry, you either need to own
[SPEAKER_00]: your facility or you need to be in the
business end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless you are completely set on being
in the cultivation side, I recommend you
[SPEAKER_00]: stick to the management aspect of the
legal part of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many things we need
administration type people for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody needs a compliance officer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The compliance officer is the person who
reads all of the rules and walks through
[SPEAKER_00]: the retail establishment, the cultivation
establishment, the extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: establishment, and makes sure that that
company is following all of the rules in
[SPEAKER_00]: case any of the inspecting departments may
pop up because they can show up at any
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The marijuana enforcement division can
show up any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need any announcements.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can walk in, knock on the door and
say, hey, we want to inspect everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now they inspect everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the Department of Agriculture decides
they want to come do a surprise inspection
[SPEAKER_00]: today at your cultivation facility,
guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Agriculture inspection
happens today.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care how big busy you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a compliance officer is a great person
to have in every single facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you would make if you were
talking about agronomy, it sounds like you
[SPEAKER_00]: were already ahead of the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: You understand agronomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You already are thinking about where to
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you were a forward thinking
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have you in some sort of a
management position, making strategies,
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking long term moves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get you out of the cultivation
and get you up in the ivory towers with
[SPEAKER_00]: all the other people wearing suits,
thinking about the direction of the
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need you helping to drive the ship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do appreciate that you want to better
yourself for the agriculture aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're going to develop that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got the passion and you're
already working with plants, it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: come naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to my podcast, expose yourself to
the garden, be in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will develop all of the skills you
need rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could tell by the way you wrote this
email, the way your punctuation is
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is spelled right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a smart person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you really insist on being in the
grow, I think you are at just the right
[SPEAKER_00]: level to get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you're going to own your own
facility, I think you are right at the
[SPEAKER_00]: right area for me to hire you.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that know too much are a pain in
the ass to hire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't want to hire somebody that was
as experienced of a grower as myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to find the correct words to say
that in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did not sound egotistical, but it would
be hard to retrain me to grow the way I
[SPEAKER_00]: need me to grow in another facility,
if that makes any sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have any bad habits that I have
to break.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can come in just knowing just enough
to be dangerous and I can mold you into
[SPEAKER_00]: the grower that I need you to be so that
we can all be successful in the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you do intend to be the lead
grower or if you want to own your own
[SPEAKER_00]: large scale cultivation facility,
there are probably large scale commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation schools that will teach you
about farming and about agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that stuff will apply to your
cannabis cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn about Department of Agriculture
rules and laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn about pesticide rules and laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn about basic greenhouse growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that stuff will apply to cannabis
and as cannabis becomes a big industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will be ahead of the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you've got college degrees for that
type of stuff, when it comes time to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: people and decide who gets the bigger
jobs, that's when you get those
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities if that's what you want to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize that I don't know which
classes to tell you to take or which
[SPEAKER_00]: schools to go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not do that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great way to segue into the
second half of the question you asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second part of the question is,
what steps did you take when you first
[SPEAKER_00]: started breeding and cultivating to have
brought you to the point where you are
[SPEAKER_00]: now?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't think I saw this path
ahead of me when I started cultivating and
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all happened in small steps just like
it was supposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't talk about this a lot and I'm not
sure if I've ever said this on the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when I was a very small child,
I had family members illegally growing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in our backyard in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's way long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody can get in trouble for that shit
now, but I might have been seven or eight
[SPEAKER_00]: years old when I remember growing these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember one of my uncles telling my
other uncle, hey, tonight, before it gets
[SPEAKER_00]: dark, make sure you do this to these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he left.
[SPEAKER_00]: My uncle was like, sure, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the day went on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later on that evening, it was going to get
dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my family was having a conversation
and my uncle said, shit, I got to go out
[SPEAKER_00]: there and do these to the weed plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, no, dude, he said to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody looked at me and they said,
shit, he's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they said to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I kind of saved the crop as a
little kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that kind of vividly in my
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wasn't allowed to touch the plants
then, but I was out there every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they were out there watering or doing
something, I was out there with those
[SPEAKER_00]: ganja plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a little tiny kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably tried to keep me out of it,
but that was my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the little kids just run shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think that the little kids are not
running shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got the ability and the freedom to
be all over the yard, the front yard,
[SPEAKER_00]: the backyard, the top of the house,
the back of the house, because it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: look weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you as an adult go play in that weird
corner in the back of the yard,
[SPEAKER_00]: people notice you're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kids, nobody thinks it's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that yard was mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I remember they're like seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were growing weed way back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was like my first step into
cultivating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was in another state where
cannabis is still illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found out that a friend was growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I accidentally discovered his grow and I
was like, hey, bro, I can see your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he was like, well, since you saw
it, can you help me?
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, since you saw it,
you obviously know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was pretty well hidden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spotted it on accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a light leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw the light leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hit me in the eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, bro, there's a light leak
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, well, should I need help
with these plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I helped him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we harvested that together and I used
that experience that I'd had from my
[SPEAKER_00]: previous family members.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I helped my buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I was helping some friends with the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had been dabbling and growing and I was
talking about how I felt like I had some
[SPEAKER_00]: better ideas than the grower for that
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they made me the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, OK, then guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We fired him.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, oh, shit, pressure's on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also gave me a bunch of equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I set up some personal grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that compounded and expanded rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I became known around my local town as the
guy that could solve the problems in your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there was something wrong, they would
call me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would come to the dispensary where I
worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would say, after work, I need you to
come look at my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they would bring me pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would just politely help everybody
solve the problems in their gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a very good reputation as being a
knowledgeable grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, that dispensary was closed
because of some basically zoning reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are dispensaries all around that bad
bitch now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was the very first dispensary in
my town.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was myself and some other friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They shut us down for zoning.
[SPEAKER_00]: White Mike was a big part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not dwell on that place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that gave me a lot of exposure and a
lot of experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started off as a young kid helping
the family.
[SPEAKER_00]: I evolved into helping and kind of taking
over a friend's grow in another state.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had an emergency.
[SPEAKER_00]: He left.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually finished his crop for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came home, harvest day to cut it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We dried it and cured it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He split it with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of my first crops that I felt
like I kind of had a lot of control over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I got my own grows go in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I was helping my friends with the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of funded me with more gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got more grows going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that point, I've had a few grows
under my belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I've got a dispensary grow to
work with and multiple personal grows of
[SPEAKER_00]: my own to work with, I'm getting a lot of
exposure to these plants, to their
[SPEAKER_00]: problems, to their cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of rooms to play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm getting friends having me come
over and look at crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made quite a reputation and had quite a
nice little following around here when one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the larger dispensaries was rebuilding
their facility and they called me and
[SPEAKER_00]: asked me to partner with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to work with an architect and an
HVAC person and a whole bunch of different
[SPEAKER_00]: people involved with the city and building
codes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I learned a tremendous amount about
building a cultivation facility and
[SPEAKER_00]: working with all of those contractors and
licensing people.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot to think about and a lot
to work with in that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a tremendous amount there and
got paid in that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually I parted ways with that
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were just some personal issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get along with the owner.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are different kinds of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is all I need to say about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are completely different types of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no problem with who he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has no problem with who I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just see things differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I moved on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took over another grow and another
location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that grow I pulled three hundred
and fourteen pounds out of one hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was pulling three point one four
pounds per light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really gaining momentum there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got really good at commercial
cultivation there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I trained another staff at that facility
and then I moved on to another place where
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a nice staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a really large facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We built another facility next door in the
build of that next facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to see and participate in a lot of
the work and a lot of the meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to learn a lot again about HVAC
installation, about sizing HVAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to learn a lot about electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to learn about commercial
cultivation, construction, the planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen all aspects of it from the idea
in somebody's head to finding investors,
[SPEAKER_00]: how to get the money to do it,
to getting people to simply believe in
[SPEAKER_00]: you, to get it done, to getting the
lawyers, the accountants, the city people,
[SPEAKER_00]: the state people, the marijuana
enforcement division, the Department of
[SPEAKER_00]: Ag, the people who need to put more
electricity on that pole.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to get all of them in the same
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been there for all of that silly
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am so blessed that I've been
involved in all of that because every one
[SPEAKER_00]: of those little things is a step that has
gotten me to where I am now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I saw that small facility expand to
become a larger facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to lead that team.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to learn about commercial drying and
curing, all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen all aspects of it before I was
even in the commercial growing part where
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a bud tender doing the
over-the-counter part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to see that aspect as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I started doing consulting for many
other commercial facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have walked into many facilities and
seen how many places are built.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can walk in and tell you what's wrong
with the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can improve your cultivation by 30%
within a certain amount of time,
[SPEAKER_00]: guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been many steps to get to where I
am today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't just been like a, hey,
this happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a lot of steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is kind of how the commercial grow
part of my career developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The breeding was just passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said that you had a passion for the
plants earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I simply have a fascination and a passion
for breeding cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was growing these plants for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started buying seeds like most of us do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We trade clones with our friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get plants from here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you start seeing that they're all
sevens out of 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want an 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a passionate grower, I don't want to
grow sevens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to grow eights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to grow fucking elevens all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought the only way I'm going to get
anything better is if I order new seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and get new shit in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was getting eights and nines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't find any tens or elevens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, ah, there's something close
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just not where I want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a couple of my friends were like,
bro, it's not too far before you start
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, it's not happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm focused on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this plant a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really time to start doing some
pollen chucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: My intention was to make seeds for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a bunch of seeds for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started growing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my friends are like, bro,
that is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I have some?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was giving seeds away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to a couple of cannabis cups in
Denver and I gave away probably five
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand seeds over two events,
just passing out packs of five and ten
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds to friends and random people and
strangers and smokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone who I saw with nutrients,
if they had a bag of nutrients like they
[SPEAKER_00]: bought nutrients or were given a nutrient
package at the show, I gave them seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got seeds to grow with those
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a sign that they're a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spread a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't expect to just start a seed
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of time to develop a brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to develop seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds have to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have to see that it is something
worth growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to create demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly it has to just be a quality
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that comes from me being passionate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep going back to that passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cultivation part, the knowledge,
the experience, that commercial aspect of
[SPEAKER_00]: my career, that all came from experience,
from slow baby steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And exposure and also doing a good fucking
job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about the way to get into the
industry is to go be a trimmer or just
[SPEAKER_00]: show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Showing up is the first step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started off and showed that I could
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, man, I can help you
transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I transplanted like a champion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one day they needed help
budtending.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I budtended.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, dude, you're good at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually I ended up with the
keys to the whole facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was basically mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So baby steps get you going, showing that
you give a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll get you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like going to martial arts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or playing an instrument or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to start off learning your
rudiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one day you're doing paradiddles
with your feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're doing karate, you start off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start you off in karate, just
throwing left punch, right punch,
[SPEAKER_00]: left punch, right punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ten years later, you're fucking doing back
flips and spin kicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all starts off in baby steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how the career aspect of my life
got going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the breeding, the seed part,
that is all passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just my love for growing,
for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you breed some seeds and then you've
got a handful of seeds, the real
[SPEAKER_00]: excitement is in growing those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to see what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I just create it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I just make the next chem dog?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I just make a bunch of duds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I make something that tastes magical?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I make really amazing medicine for my
friends that are sick?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I make something that is totally a
piece of shit and I got to throw it away?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is so much fun to find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very similar feeling to opening
Christmas presents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even better, it's like opening up a
package of baseball cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I guess it's 2020, so they're fucking
Pokemon cards or Magic the Gathering cards
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're looking to see what you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in cannabis plants, you've got to wait
a little bit or a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to make the seeds and then
you've got to grow them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while they're vegging, you're paying
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's a little taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's kind of stretchier.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's got some crazy leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you start flowering them,
it gets exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pull out all the boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, damn it, I was hoping that
one was a girl because it was pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then about week five, you're like,
oh, look at the buds on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And week six, it starts stinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week seven and eight, you're like,
holy shit, look what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made amazing buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you're like, ah, look what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of duds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's so much fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all that passion that you can hear in
my voice when it comes to talking about a
[SPEAKER_00]: phenol hunt of seeds that I've bred,
that is what got me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always staying passionate, always loving
that plant and always breeding for what I
[SPEAKER_00]: felt was right and not just doing it for
something that I thought would be some
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I was asked one time to make a strain
by another professional breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his idea was fucking a hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went very well for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad that he kind of recommended or
asked me to do that favor because in my
[SPEAKER_00]: career, that did help me quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just doing things that I thought were
right, just following my heart,
[SPEAKER_00]: following my head, try not to screw
anybody over, try not to do anything from
[SPEAKER_00]: my ego or from my wallet or anything like
that or for hype or for fame, just doing
[SPEAKER_00]: it because I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to be what kept me moving
forward and kept me in this game for so
[SPEAKER_00]: long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, right now, I feel like I'm
at a high point and I'm just going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never felt like my company,
like iRegenetics has had so much momentum
[SPEAKER_00]: before it has until this exact moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like it just gets stronger and
stronger every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then where that commercial side and
that breeding side meet is I get the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to run large batches of plants,
large populations in other people's
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities and see what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That also gives me access to many plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where the commercial and the
breeder and the passion side kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: combine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also believe in that phrase that
people say, if you love your job,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't work a day in your life or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love what I'm doing and it shows
business owners, grow owners, dispensary
[SPEAKER_00]: owners.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can tell when I show up that I'm
excited and eager to get their grow going
[SPEAKER_00]: top notch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they see it in just a few days,
just a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start turning the grow around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that passion, that experience has
gotten me a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me recap because you did ask a
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got off on a long rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not sure what to recommend for
schooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say stay in business school.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to get you the furthest in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you ask, what steps did I take?
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know it at the time, but the
steps were presented to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you believe in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't talk about that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the show, I follow Rastafari.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that Jah put those steps in front
of me and I was wise enough to take the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities that were presented.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by doing what I thought was right,
I ended up right where I feel like I am
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get back on track because I got
really rambly here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wraps this up with, I would love to
hear back from you.
