[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode 787 of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a fun episode planned.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Later in the episode, I will give away a
pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's jump right into the breeding talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a great email here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They came from our friend Jason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's not waste too much time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The email goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, my name is Jason.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from Northern Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to meet you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I really love the show and your
hard work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep up the good fight, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't stop won't stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I'm a big fan here and I really
rely on your information as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding and selections go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a huge compliment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Knowing that you rely on my breeding,
you respect and trust my guidance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big up and fist bump.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I'm currently about to start a
breeding run, which I am super excited
[SPEAKER_01]: about, but I'm not sure how to select
which female to select to spray and
[SPEAKER_01]: reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our friend Jason has a breeding project
in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to make some feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got two plants, but they cannot
decide which one of those two female
[SPEAKER_01]: plants they should reverse to turn into a
pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's dig more into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I have plant A that checks all of
the boxes to what we like, but it lacks
[SPEAKER_01]: Terps, but it is highly potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got a plant that checks all of
the boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a perfect breeding plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a perfect female except for the fact
that it lacks Terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, this plan is highly potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which kind of sometimes may make up for
that lack of Terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a highly potent plant that
checks all of the boxes, but it lacks
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then it goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says plant B is not as potent,
but has a sweet grapefruit Kush flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is dynamite.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this plant isn't as potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It lacks the potency, but it's got that
flavor that they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says a sweet grapefruit Kush flavor,
which sounds quite delightful.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, that a stringent,
a bitter, almost citrusy grapefruit with
[SPEAKER_01]: some Kush on top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: To mellow it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like a great flavor in my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes me think it's going to have a
great buzz as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that sounds like a great idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the flavor there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the aroma there and it's
dynamite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says this plant just doesn't give me as
medicated properly like plant A does.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to breed with a purpose and add
those Terps to the potent plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So which plant would be the best to spray
with the STS and use the feminized pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a couple of solid answers for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I'm not sure if I use the Terpy
plant as a pollen donor, since it's what
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm after.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, please elaborate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope this makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes great sense, rather.
[SPEAKER_01]: This makes a lot of good sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, thank you for your reply.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much love from your neighbors up North.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can use my name on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this makes it, I'm glad you included
that because I started this whole thing by
[SPEAKER_01]: saying this came from our friend,
Jason, big up to my friend, Jason.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got two plants and you can't
decide which one to use as the pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: donor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some great advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't only do my selections based on
flavors, aroma, potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of other things that I
think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's look at both of these plants and
think which plant has got the structure
[SPEAKER_01]: and shape you are after in your progeny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about how far apart the nodes are.
[SPEAKER_01]: The node spacing is the branch spacing.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much branching does the plant make?
[SPEAKER_01]: How is the plant overall shaped?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a real tall, skinny,
wispy plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you have a short squat, bushy,
wide plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you want your plants in the future
to be shaped like?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a very important factor to
consider when it does come to selecting
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, leaf size and shape definitely make
a big difference in that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want a long, skinny leaf?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want a big, fat, broad leaf?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want some more in the middle?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something to pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, when it comes to breeding,
think about the flowering time of the
[SPEAKER_01]: selected plants you are going to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: That flowering time is going to translate
heavily into your breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you have one that flowers at a more
appropriate time?
[SPEAKER_01]: If one of those plants flowers longer and
one flowers more quickly, that trait will
[SPEAKER_01]: pass if you use that plant in the breeding
project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most likely, the male is going to heavily
contribute to that flowering time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the reverse male will say pollen donor
from here out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try to remember to say pollen donor
from here out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make no promises.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, do these plants handle stress?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it handle grower stress?
[SPEAKER_01]: By grower stress, I mean, can you top it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you pop it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you lollipop it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you twist it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you defoliate it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you make mistakes with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you abuse it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you beat it up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you overwater it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you underwater it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can it handle environmental stress?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of overwater underwater.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, how about vapor pressure deficit
issues, humidity spikes, humidity drops,
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature spikes, temperature drops,
diurnal swings?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can these plants handle those sort of
things?
[SPEAKER_01]: The one that handles the stress the best
is the one that I would use as the pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: donor, in my opinion and in my experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you asked specifically which plant I
would recommend to use here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my opinion, my advice,
and I will explain why I would do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a solid reason for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would choose the potent plant as the
pollen donor and allow that one to
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinate multiple females.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like you've got one female plant
that you want to pollinate, but I would
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinate multiple females.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason for that is when you pollinate
one female, you kind of see what the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: A and plant B, you can see what that
brought to the table and what they made.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you put plant A to plant B,
C and D, put that pollen on multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: females, we can really see what the boy is
adding to the mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you've got a female plant that
makes blueberry turps, a female plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: makes chocolate turps, and a female plant
that makes banana turps, and then you add
[SPEAKER_01]: gas to it, did you get, I forgot the
flavors already, did you get gassy
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberries, gassy whatever else I said
and glassy bananas?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it all bananas, all gas?
[SPEAKER_01]: See what that male is adding to the mix in
there and see what it's contributing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just make one cross, you only know
how that male interacts with that one
[SPEAKER_01]: female.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you cross it to multiple females,
we can see how that male expresses itself
[SPEAKER_01]: on a wider palette through more
population.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my experience, in my opinion,
that's really helpful for selecting
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding projects, for selecting breeding
males, breeding pairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That really goes a long way, in my
opinion, in my experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're focused on making the
grapefruit kush and the terpe plant
[SPEAKER_01]: together, or the potent plant and the
terpe plant together, but also why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to reverse one plant,
why not put a couple of females in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple females in the room with that
male, to make a multiple crosses,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of seeds to play with.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just more fun to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also that way, like I said, you get to
really see what that male plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing to the mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just add, let's just say chocolate
and vanilla together, we know what
[SPEAKER_01]: chocolate and vanilla tastes like,
but what if I put chocolate and
[SPEAKER_01]: strawberry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does the chocolate dominate the mix?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does the strawberry dominate the mix?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do I get a nice chocolate strawberry
mix?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what happens in there and see
what the plants do that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would start by using the potent plant
as my pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then what would happen, in my opinion,
what I think would happen, and I'm kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: doing this, I used, when I made the Ninja
Turtle line, I'm not sure if you've been
[SPEAKER_01]: following for that long, I took a reversed
blueberry cookies plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That blueberry cookies plant was amazing,
and I pollinated a bunch of other female
[SPEAKER_01]: plants with that plant, and I named them
after the Ninja Turtles.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I noticed is the blueberry cookies
showed itself very well in all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: other crosses, but it also blended very
well to a lot of those crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what ended up happening was that
potency from the reversed blueberry
[SPEAKER_01]: cookies, the potency, the vigor,
the plant shape, all the good traits from
[SPEAKER_01]: that passed on to the offspring into the
breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's talk about, I said Ninja Turtles
line, we'll use Raphael as a good example
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a reversed blueberry cookies,
pollinated a strawberry fields plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: makes Raphael.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I bred those two together,
I could really see the strawberry
[SPEAKER_01]: starburst or the strawberry fields traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could smell it, I could taste it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also it had the vigor,
the potency, and some of the aroma and
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor of the blueberry cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was able to get that potency,
the vigor, the plant shape, all that good
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Into that other end of the offspring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also brought a lot of that
strawberry flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's talk about another one in the
mix was I pollinated the platinum tangy,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that made Michelangelo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I got that growth structure,
the shape, the vigor from the blueberry
[SPEAKER_01]: cookies, but I also got that platinum
tangy aroma and flavor mixed in with the
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberry cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my idea, my goal would actually ended
up happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm kind of recommending to you is
use that potency, rely on the potency from
[SPEAKER_01]: that reversed male, then let the females
you're using change up the palette
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout each plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe you got a strawberry,
an orange, a lemon.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else did I use?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of different things in
that mix, but there's definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: strawberry, orange, lemon, and blueberry
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I brought all of those out and mixed
that with the original blueberry cookies
[SPEAKER_01]: cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if this were me, if this was my
breeding project, if I was in charge of
[SPEAKER_01]: this room, I would select the more potent
plant, the plant with the more potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also don't forget about vigor,
plant structure, resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are these plants resistant to bugs,
pathogens?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they get problems?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would find the best plant with the best
potency, the best vigor, best resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be my pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would rely on all those female
plants to be my, my terp provider,
[SPEAKER_01]: my flavor, my differences, because that
male is going to mix well with a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you select the proper, I said male once
again, but that reversed female,
[SPEAKER_01]: that pollen donor plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you've done the pollination,
once you've made seeds, the next step to
[SPEAKER_01]: do is to grow these seeds out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you only pollinated that one plant,
grow as many of those seeds as you
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly can.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if you have created what you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you find the terpy plant with the
potency, the vigor, the shape,
[SPEAKER_01]: the structure you're looking for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: If so, then you've done exactly what
you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've reached your breeding goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would take that plant and I would find
something else to do with it to further
[SPEAKER_01]: breed it, maybe self that plant,
maybe breed that to other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that would be my new keeper to start
my new breeding project with.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you bred this to multiple females,
grow out a bunch of those female seeds or
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds from those other plants and see what
you've created.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what that male plant is contributing
to that mix amongst that population of
[SPEAKER_01]: females.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so much fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my favorite part, taking a reverse
plant or a male plant, pollinating a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of girls, not just growing out the this
batch and this batch, but growing out all
[SPEAKER_01]: of them and seeing like, oh, the guy does
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy made all of these plants get a
chocolate aroma, but also they also added
[SPEAKER_01]: their own, but also some of the plants got
like this weird leaf shape that came from
[SPEAKER_01]: the guy plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll notice what does cross and what
doesn't cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll notice, you'll figure out what's a
recessive trait, what's a dominant,
[SPEAKER_01]: a co-dominant trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll just learn a lot about your plants
by breeding them to other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I said originally that what I would
do is take the most potent plant and that
[SPEAKER_01]: would be my candidate for reversal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're really going to be blown away
by the next thing that I say.
[SPEAKER_01]: After you've done this cross, after you've
taken your candidate that you've reversed
[SPEAKER_01]: and you've pollinated, you've grown it,
you found out some, you found some seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: found out what you produced, found the
keeper out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now guess what your next project is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take that terpy one, reverse it,
pollinate the potent plant, then grow it
[SPEAKER_01]: out again.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got the opportunity,
like I mentioned, before, grow out,
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinate multiple females with this
reversal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, if you can pollinate the same
females that you did the opposite plant
[SPEAKER_01]: with and let's see what this plant is
contributing to the mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we get to see what plant A does when
it's reversed and pollinates multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: females and we can see what traits deliver
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we'll reverse plant B and pollinate
multiple females and see what traits come
[SPEAKER_01]: up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we can even see what the male is
delivering because now we can really see
[SPEAKER_01]: what the female is contributing to the
cross because we've pollinated it with two
[SPEAKER_01]: different sets of pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's a lot to get to get into.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really, that's really in depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's in the mind of a breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, once I make a cross,
once I've reversed something, that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to reverse the other one that I
didn't choose and reverse that and then
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinate everything and then grow both
batches side by side and see what I've
[SPEAKER_01]: created.
[SPEAKER_01]: It becomes really crazy, but it is a lot
of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you start this, this could be a
lifetime project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't ever rush a breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let the seeds finish, grow out the
population and find the plant that you are
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the plant that you're looking for is
not in there, do it the opposite way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pick different parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never be discouraged with breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll always find something great.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the goal here is to improve upon
these lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your cross doesn't come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if these plants are both, I don't know
your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to judge you, but if these
plants are both sevens, the goal is to
[SPEAKER_01]: come out with a plant that is at least an
eight, maybe a nine, hopefully a 10 if you
[SPEAKER_01]: can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you haven't improved upon the
species of cannabis, then that is your
[SPEAKER_01]: responsibility today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Decide what to do with those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're not amazing, maybe don't pass
them out to the whole world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't share them with a bunch of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe keep them to yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if those are stellar, make sure you do
share those seeds with people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get those out so that more people can grow
high quality ganja.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Jason Johnson, I really feel
like you got me rambling pretty good on
[SPEAKER_01]: that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I answered your question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't just focus on the potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't just focus on those aromas and
flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also focus on resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does it handle problems?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does it handle grower stress,
environmental stress?
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about all of that other stuff as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I would recommend choosing the
plant with the potency and pollinating
[SPEAKER_01]: those terpy females.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody else out there has any
questions, you know that I would love to
[SPEAKER_01]: help you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: My email address is grow from your heart
at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me those grow questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have one more question we're going to
bang out here on this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we will get to the seed giveaway.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our friends at seeds here now.com are
going to give away a free pack of iry
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic seeds here on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is almost time to tell you how to win
those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's jump into this next email.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came from our friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to our friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope your new year is off to a great
start, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things are killing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: January was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: February has begun very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing to complain about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope everything is going great for you as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I have two questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Question number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was under the impression that if you
self a plant, it is a complete copy of the
[SPEAKER_01]: mom used, but I was recently told that
this is not exactly the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you elaborate on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the part one of the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also remember saying something a
while ago about an auto flower collab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any movement or updates on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the fam and I are planning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to read this part.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're moving near me and we're going to
hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not going to read where you're
moving to because the whole world doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: need to know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, we will hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will take dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's address the second question first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it backwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: The auto flower collab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Daz with night owl seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what he's calling himself
this week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Daz, you change your name a lot,
but I try to keep up with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing but love and respect and congrats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, Daz is working some auto flower
stuff with some I read genetic stuff in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a solid info on exactly how
far Daz has gotten into that, but I know
[SPEAKER_01]: the project is making great success.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've ran some of the F ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've looked at pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not exactly sure how far he's gotten
with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't kept in touch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't asked, but Daz is working on
that feminized auto flower project with
[SPEAKER_01]: the I read genetic strains in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would make sure to check with a night
owl seeds, check with Daz, see what he's
[SPEAKER_01]: going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's probably got a lot more info and
updates on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those will be available through night owl.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't even have those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all his project.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got my blessing, but I'm not into
auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I made auto flowers, it wouldn't be
very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say it's like, uh, I can play any kind
of music you want, but if you put me in a
[SPEAKER_01]: country band, I can play country music,
but it's not going to feel like country
[SPEAKER_01]: music.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to have, uh, whatever
country's got that makes it feel country.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be missing a little
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just ain't going to have that feel that
a real country drummer could put to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I don't make autos.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's answer the first part of this email.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I was under the impression that if
you self a plant, it becomes a complete,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the seed should be a complete copy of
the mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take a little drink here and then
we'll answer that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even going to edit this part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to take a little drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kombucha gods for keeping me, uh,
kombucha laded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a word?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a new word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Add that to the urban dictionary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kombucha laded.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is when you're well hydrated and have
good microbes from drinking plenty of high
[SPEAKER_01]: quality kombucha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rasta.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff made that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want fucking credit for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kombucha laded.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to quit rambling and take a
drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I cut out a couple of seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's answer this question about reversing
a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you self a plant, what does that
mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we talked a moment ago about selecting
plants for feminized breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Selfing a plant is when you take two
clones of the same plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's just start with a golden goat
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to cut two clones off of a
golden goat plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to let them grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to flower them before I flower
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to treat one with a solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need to talk too much about that
solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to spray it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to spray it several times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a program.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a standard operating procedure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually this plan is going to produce
pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pollen that comes from this plant is
only female pollen because the golden goat
[SPEAKER_01]: plant that I started with does not contain
any male chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this plan is going to go sort of into a
panic mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to create pollen sacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those pollen sacks will only contain
female pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I will take that female pollen from
the golden goat and put it on another
[SPEAKER_01]: female golden goat plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is known as selfing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is called selfing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have S one to this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a first generation of a selfed
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took the golden goat and the golden goat
and I selfed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it self because it's a self
pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no other, there are no other
genetics adulterating this mix,
[SPEAKER_01]: but now I can make pure golden goat seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those will be feminized golden goat S one
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the question that arises has arose,
has been brought up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was asked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know what I'm saying anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question here is I was under the
impression that they would be a complete
[SPEAKER_01]: copy of the mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Approximately 50 to 70% of the phenotypes
that come from those seeds will look just
[SPEAKER_01]: like the original golden goat mother.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of those plants are going to look
a little bit like the mother plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: was used to make golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some will look a little bit like the
father plant that was used to make the
[SPEAKER_01]: golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to say 50 to 60, maybe 70% of
those are going to be right down the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to look just like that
original golden goat, but you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have some on this side that look a little
bit like the mom plant that made golden
[SPEAKER_01]: goat and some on this side that look a
little bit like the dad plant that made
[SPEAKER_01]: golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We may also see phenotypes that express
traits of the grandparents of the original
golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we may see traits of the mom and then
also traits of the mom's parents and
[SPEAKER_01]: traits of the dad and also traits of the
dad's parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only way to really identify that is to
be familiar with the parents and
[SPEAKER_01]: grandparents of that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I grow it out, I can identify it
because I know what used.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know all of the ingredients so I could
taste that I could say, oh, there's the
[SPEAKER_01]: cinnamon.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the maple syrup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can identify every ingredient by looking
at it because I'm so familiar with each
[SPEAKER_01]: parent plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you make those reversals,
most of the time about 50% of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I say most of the time because these
are genetics, this depends very much on
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant that you are working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants reverse very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants don't reverse well at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants, when you reverse them,
they make a bunch of intersex problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants, when you reverse them,
they make a bunch of amazing gold like the
[SPEAKER_01]: golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes a whole bunch of amazingness.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some plants, a lot of chem cultivars,
a lot of the sour diesel stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you reverse that, it just makes
intersex garbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in my experience, when I self plant,
I generally get about 50% of the
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look just like the original mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I've got that group that looks a
little bit like grandma, the group that
[SPEAKER_01]: looks a little bit like grandpa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we've got those outliers that
look a little bit like the great
[SPEAKER_01]: grandparents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's talk about something else really
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all feminized seeds are what are known
as selfed seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of feminized seeds are also known as
reversals.
[SPEAKER_01]: A moment ago, I talk about taking two
clones of the same golden goat plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We reverse the golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put that pollen on golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have selfed that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did it to itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got itself pregnant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gave itself a selfie.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll never forget that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That plant is selfed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an S1.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if I put that golden goat pollen on
something different?
[SPEAKER_01]: What if I put that golden goat pollen on a
GMO plant and I make something we call
[SPEAKER_01]: garlic goat?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is no longer selfing because I didn't
pollinate itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pollinated another plant with reversed
pollens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of being an S1, that plant
would be labeled an R1.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a first filial generation of a
reversed cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes you're going to see plants
that say S1.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it may say R1.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it may not give you any
indication at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it is a golden goat feminized seed and
you know that it's a clone only,
[SPEAKER_01]: that is most likely the original plant
reversed and selfed onto itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it is something like, let's talk
about, like I just said a moment ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: the garlic goat, that is a golden goat to
the GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a reversal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is going to show us phenotypes that
look like the 50-50 mix, probably close to
[SPEAKER_01]: 50-50.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be pretty close to 50-50.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll find some that look just like
golden goat, just like the GMO combined.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to see that phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we're going to see phenotypes that
look a little bit like GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we're going to see phenotypes that
look a little bit like golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also going to see some phenotypes,
a very small percentage of the phenotypes
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to look like golden goats
parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the phenotypes will look like
the GMO parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're going to have a couple of
phenotypes that you can't tell what the
[SPEAKER_01]: hell is going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just got traits from everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like the mailman's kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: That does happen a little bit when you
start doing the other reversals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the basic difference between
selfing and reversing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are the basic phenotypes and
traits that I think you are going to find
[SPEAKER_01]: with those feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the self seeds, most of your
phenotypes are going to look like the
[SPEAKER_01]: original mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll find some grandparents and a little
bit of great grandparents.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the reversals that are not pure self,
you're going to see the 50-50 phenotype
[SPEAKER_01]: that looks like mom and dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to find some that look like
mom some that look like dad, some that
[SPEAKER_01]: look like grandparents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're going to find some weirdos
that looks like weird mixes of each trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you just took all the traits that
were available from both plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaf shape, the structure,
the odor, the flavor, trichome
[SPEAKER_01]: development, took both of those and just
shook them up, took all the trait counts
[SPEAKER_01]: from each plant, shook them up and just
grew them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And who knows what ornaments got hung on
which tree, which alleles got given to
[SPEAKER_01]: each plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes you're going to see some
that just looks like you just mixed up Mr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potato Head and got the parts that you
got.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, something different.
