[SPEAKER_00]: Let me turn down this music a little bit
and do a quick Update if you've been
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to the previous episodes You do
know that I had a little spider buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging out in my grow space kind of
working as a security guard Kind of a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room mascot just in there hanging out with
me while I'm working keeping me company
[SPEAKER_00]: Listening to podcasts and enjoying some
good music with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, the update is the spider has left
the building I don't know what happened to
[SPEAKER_00]: my little furry arachnid friend,
but the spider is no longer there I would
[SPEAKER_00]: see the spider every day sometimes two
times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen the spider in two days,
which is usually four Garden visits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't do anything to the spider.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't put out any sticky traps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't apply any pesticides I didn't put
any predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just business as usual in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I didn't apply a pesticide
because that spider was there I skipped a
[SPEAKER_00]: routine pesticide spray and now the spider
is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just casually politely left the
building I don't know if he got bored.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if he ate all the bugs I
don't know if he just wanted to go find
[SPEAKER_00]: some spider ladies to go mate with I don't
know what his plan was but the spider is
[SPEAKER_00]: gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of great Feedback about the
spider people told me what kind of spider
[SPEAKER_00]: it was people told me that it's basically
harmless to people It's not going to cause
[SPEAKER_00]: any damage to my home or my plants People
said that I was doing the right thing by
[SPEAKER_00]: leaving that spider in the grow And by
watching that spider grow he was
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely eating something I think he was
eating fungus gnats or probably fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: gnats is what I think he was eating
Honestly, that's all I really see in my
[SPEAKER_00]: grow space that I don't Fungus gnats are
the only thing that can kind of get away
[SPEAKER_00]: with my grow space They last in there for
a minute, but I think he ate most of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: He chewed them Up and he has moved on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if he died and just fell down
into a pot I don't know if I swept him up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if he's in there just hiding
I don't know if he moved on he's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of great feedback is what I
was getting at Somebody asked how he got
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how the spider got in there
It is not a super secure grow space to be
[SPEAKER_00]: to be completely honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more secure from people Children and
pets more than it is from spiders.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is in a home grow So it could have came
in through not completely sealed Window
[SPEAKER_00]: area it could have came in through the
door.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in a home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in Colorado Who the fuck knows how
that spider got in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a super It's not Fort Knox that
grow it's it's a veg space So it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: Fort Knox, but the spider got in and he
got out I don't know if he died I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know if he got starved to death because
there are no more bugs, but he has left
[SPEAKER_00]: the building anyway Thanks to everybody
for all the feedback about the spider.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not the spider-man podcast So
let's move forward a little bit wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: give you an update since that music died
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to move on You guys I ordered
you guys and gals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have ordered grow from your heart
podcast hats That's right grow from your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart podcast hats and I read genetics
hats have been ordered just in case you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not familiar Not only am I the host of the
grow from your heart podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the founder breeder soul proprietor
soul breeder the head motherfucker in
[SPEAKER_00]: charge of I read genetics premium seeds
That is also me all of your regular and
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds needs can be handled by I
read genetics premium seeds So I made grow
[SPEAKER_00]: from your heart podcast hats as well As I
read genetics hats if you have been paying
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to the logos It's the grow from
your heart podcast logo with the the bars
[SPEAKER_00]: for the graphic equalizer So it's got the
red yellow green stripes behind it says
[SPEAKER_00]: grow from your heart podcast I like those
hats because people in Non-cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: friendly environments can wear that hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's gonna say is that a weed hat?
[SPEAKER_00]: It just says the grow from your heart
podcast on it Doesn't look like you're on
[SPEAKER_00]: team weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody can wear that anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's gonna question you then the I
read genetics Premium seeds hat does say I
[SPEAKER_00]: read genetics premium seeds on the front
It's got the cross logo if you're familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with my the Ethiopian cross logo on the
front.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I read genetics on the side Those
hats are coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will take quite a long time The art
mint has been submitted payment has been
[SPEAKER_00]: sent now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just hurry up and wait I've got a
lot of great merchandise in the works I've
[SPEAKER_00]: spent a lot of great money a lot of money
on great merchandise and the merch is all
[SPEAKER_00]: being shipped and printed and done it is a
Weird time for buying and ordering
[SPEAKER_00]: merchandise in the world right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is delayed First off the
manufacturing times are greatly delayed
[SPEAKER_00]: and then shipping times are even more
drastically delayed So orders are stacking
[SPEAKER_00]: up which is making the orders that were
taken in January of this year are finally
[SPEAKER_00]: getting sent out to people So if you made
an order in February your weeks behind
[SPEAKER_00]: those January orders because they just got
backed up Anyway, I am rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point is there's a lot of new
merchandise coming there are Two hat
[SPEAKER_00]: designs coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another shirt design being worked
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are mood mats should be here soon
They were supposed to ship mid-october.
[SPEAKER_00]: I here we are approaching november by the
time this episode comes out No mood mats
[SPEAKER_00]: for the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: No mood mats to show off.

[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's try to get me back on
track after A total brain fart in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of that last note.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into this email here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have an email It is a breeding
question about calling males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says hey Rasta Jeff Thank you for
taking the time to read my email Hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you for taking the time to send me a
great email and thank you for listening to
[SPEAKER_00]: the show It says first thank you for all
of the valuable information you provide to
[SPEAKER_00]: the community, bro Thank you for noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that it says I've been a
listener for many a year long before the
[SPEAKER_00]: video show, which is amazing I'm also a
DGC supporter and I will be joining the
[SPEAKER_00]: iry army soon You've been listening for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you This show has not always been a
video podcast If you're new a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: old episodes are just a picture on a
screen and me rambling This is only
[SPEAKER_00]: recently around episode five hundred and
eighty something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think five hundred and something Became
a video show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's almost a hundred video shows when I
say that out loud, but it wasn't always a
[SPEAKER_00]: video show So thank you for being there
from the beginning when we were just doing
[SPEAKER_00]: when I was shooting Just doing an audio
show trying to figure out my goal trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to figure out my whole idea of what the
podcast was Thank you for being there for
[SPEAKER_00]: such a long time I do appreciate that and
big up to the DGC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the dude grow show without
the dude grow show the dude grows crew
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast probably wouldn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: They inspired me a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They taught me a little bit I've been on
their show that definitely advertises for
[SPEAKER_00]: me and gives me a springboard and they're
also Some of my favorite friends big up to
[SPEAKER_00]: Scotty real big up to the dude big up to
guru Shout out to the whole gang everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: behind the scenes that doesn't get the
love.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a podcast producer I understand how
much work you're putting in great show
[SPEAKER_00]: great work great efforts you guys go
follow the DGC if you're not already
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough advertising for another
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep it moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes I will be joining the iry army
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: No pressure my friend Money is tight these
days money is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are supporting the patreon
I appreciate it join in when you can it
[SPEAKER_00]: goes on it says for my question I feel
like you would be a great help and offer
[SPEAKER_00]: the insight which I cannot find online
Thank you in advance for your expert help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that I like that you come to me
instead of going to the internet because
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said it before the internet Can be so
full of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The internet is a great place for some
information, but there's no security guard
[SPEAKER_00]: or gatekeeper at the internet if I wanted
to I could type an article on the internet
[SPEAKER_00]: that said I made 9 million dollars last
week and that I've got the most prolific
[SPEAKER_00]: seed company and the number one podcast on
the planet and then I can benchpress
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking 600 pounds and fucking I could
type whatever I want on the internet and
[SPEAKER_00]: people will read it and a lot of people
will think it's true and nobody will
[SPEAKER_00]: fact-check it and it will become fact that
will become story that'll be the truth
[SPEAKER_00]: that always lives on forever because
that's the internet anybody could type
[SPEAKER_00]: anything which is great and fun but it's
very problematic because I see a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people typing a lot of things that will
cause more problems in the grow than they
[SPEAKER_00]: will possibly solve so the internet's
great but the internet can also be a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem so I appreciate that you came
straight to me and you're like hey the
[SPEAKER_00]: internet kind of is crazy dude here is a
person that may know maybe I'll ask them I
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate that so let me get my high
rambling ass back on track I do think that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the insight and then you said
thank you for the expert advice I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know about an expert just an idiot with a
lot of experience I've done this a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: take a lot of notes I'm passionately
curious I feel like these plants and I
[SPEAKER_00]: just get along so much it just feels
natural to me it's just like I know when I
[SPEAKER_00]: walk into the ground like oh it's too
humid in there I could just feel it I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: like my own humidity gauge humid a stat
anyway hygrometer that's what the word is
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you guys I'm high and rambly today
it's fun when you get on a microphone just
[SPEAKER_00]: feel comfortable it goes on it does say
here's the actual question of the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running a phenohunt consisting of five
strains my goal is to find a potential
[SPEAKER_00]: candidate as a keeper plus a breeding male
alright I do like that you're gonna do a
[SPEAKER_00]: phenohunt your goal is to find breeding
plants a breeding keeper and a breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: male that is a great idea however grow
them out a lot this one time isn't enough
[SPEAKER_00]: do your phenohunt find the plants that you
like as a grower as a consumer as a not as
[SPEAKER_00]: a breeder yet find the plants that you
like just as a grower find the plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: stand out as a grower and those should be
your stellar breeding plants but running
[SPEAKER_00]: them once for a phenohunt in my opinion is
not enough to select a winner for a
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding program it is only one date
anybody can hide their flaws they're crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: they're fucking their issues for one date
it's gonna take two or three dates to find
[SPEAKER_00]: out the problem of these plants you need
to stress them the first grow do it
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly do it perfectly so you can find
out what are these plants express what do
[SPEAKER_00]: they look like without stressful
conditions maybe some of those plants will
[SPEAKER_00]: show you intersex traits maybe some
mutants maybe undesirable growth traits
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're not looking for run them one
time the second time change some things up
[SPEAKER_00]: push the nutrients a little harder push
the lights a little harder do something
[SPEAKER_00]: different to almost induce a little bit of
stress to these plants then you'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: some intersex plants you'll see some
mutants you'll see shit you don't like at
[SPEAKER_00]: this point then the third time really mess
with them mess up that light cycle mess up
[SPEAKER_00]: their feeding give them drastic
temperature swings see if these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: show you intersex traits intersex problems
growth problems any traits that you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: like you should have a goal when you were
breeding you should know what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants you like do these plants within
those three runs do you see shit that you
[SPEAKER_00]: do not like part of breeding it's really
easy to find what you do like how do you
[SPEAKER_00]: notice what you do not like what do you
not accept into your breeding program look
[SPEAKER_00]: for that so I love the idea of doing a
phenol hunt to find plants for breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: but let's run them a couple of times and
build a relationship with them like I said
[SPEAKER_00]: I compare it to dating people this is you
can hide your crazy your insecurity your
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking psycho your problems your issues
for a couple of dates but by the third or
[SPEAKER_00]: fourth date the bullshit's gonna start
coming through like you're gonna be late
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna fucking complain about
everything whatever issues red flags are
[SPEAKER_00]: to you you'll find those but it may not
pop up on that first run with these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: just like you may not see the crazy on a
first date so run them a couple of times
[SPEAKER_00]: before you breed to them that is just my
advice do it your way have fun grow from
[SPEAKER_00]: your heart breed with love fuck the rules
do your thing but my advice for better
[SPEAKER_00]: success is to grow the females at least a
couple of times grow the male at least
[SPEAKER_00]: once or twice almost all the way through
with the male and see what you've got test
[SPEAKER_00]: them stress test them abuse them don't do
the abusive part to your date that is the
[SPEAKER_00]: part where we've got to draw the line the
date will show you the problems that
[SPEAKER_00]: people will show you the problems don't
abuse them you do your thing but do abuse
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants stress test these plants people
are getting stress tested by life they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: show you their problems we've got to throw
some fucking accounting issues and some
[SPEAKER_00]: baby daddy drama at the plants also and
see how they handle some shit alright it
[SPEAKER_00]: says I flipped a flower and I am on day
nine now I have cloned everything and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: separated the males and the females my
main question here is when do I start
[SPEAKER_00]: calling males that you deem unworthy
that's a very good question it says I plan
[SPEAKER_00]: on taking all of the males 50 plus days to
flower to see their full expression would
[SPEAKER_00]: it be more logical to call along the way
or at the end or stay the path and see
[SPEAKER_00]: their final forms then decide and call all
now I'm gonna go back to my maybe not the
[SPEAKER_00]: best analogy but I'm gonna go back to my
dating analogy and if you can see that a
[SPEAKER_00]: male plant is not going to reach your goal
in your breeding program you don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it around if it if you're looking for
tall skinny plants and you got a short
[SPEAKER_00]: squatty plant why would you even keep the
short squat one you want you want the tall
[SPEAKER_00]: skinny one if you want a short squatty one
get rid of the tall stretchy ones if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not fitting the criteria which you're
looking for get it out of there why waste
[SPEAKER_00]: time with it you don't have to go on a
second date with a plant that you already
[SPEAKER_00]: know is crazy on the first date so you can
call them as you're going there's no you
[SPEAKER_00]: can call them in veg they're your plants
they're just plants it's very okay to call
[SPEAKER_00]: plants you could just get rid of them
don't waste the time the soil the water
[SPEAKER_00]: the lights the energy the numbers in my
situation plant counts are very important
[SPEAKER_00]: so if I see one that I'm like oh I don't
like that clip let's replace it with
[SPEAKER_00]: something that is good because I can only
have so many so I would start calling as
[SPEAKER_00]: soon as you start seeing that those plants
don't reach your criteria but to do that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got to have a solid goal what is
your goal you've got a bunch of new female
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and you've got a new male plant
you've got to establish a goal before you
[SPEAKER_00]: get much further what do you want the male
plant to look like why are you breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: with those selected female plants what are
you trying to do why do those plants stand
[SPEAKER_00]: out to you to breed what do you want from
your male plant write all that criteria
[SPEAKER_00]: down maybe make a checklist I want my male
plant to be shaped like this leaves like
[SPEAKER_00]: this I want it to smell like this I want
it to flower around this many weeks I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to just write down a checklist of what
you're looking for and if it doesn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: that get rid of it is very easy to pull
plants that don't reach your criteria as a
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder seeing what you like is really
easy I said this a moment ago seeing what
[SPEAKER_00]: you like is really easy but then also
identifying the red flags or traits that
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't like is another special skill
that you have to acquire as a breeder then
[SPEAKER_00]: there's another thing of becoming attached
to the plants we we love these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: we've spent weeks on them we know that
it's got potential even though that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: the breeder for this run I should save
that mail and use it for the next run
[SPEAKER_00]: because it would work well just get rid of
some shit sometimes pick the best of the
[SPEAKER_00]: best we're breeding cannabis there are so
many people out there breeding there are
[SPEAKER_00]: so many plants out there there are so many
seeds out there why would you waste time
[SPEAKER_00]: with something that kind of shows
potential when you could fuck with
[SPEAKER_00]: something that look at this rock star that
is just ready to go don't waste time with
[SPEAKER_00]: sixes and sevens in the grow space we only
have room for nines and tens I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: get cannabis to an eleven so quit fucking
with the fives and sixes I said fives is
[SPEAKER_00]: not even gonna edit that quit fucking with
the fives quit fucking with the sixes get
[SPEAKER_00]: them out early if you know that's not
reaching your criteria don't use it I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't like to use a male plant that's a
freaky mutant in a breeding program that
[SPEAKER_00]: has potential to go to market if it is
something for my personal experimental
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff to keep back that you guys will
never see other than pictures and I may
[SPEAKER_00]: out cross it later then I may use a freaky
mutant just for my own personal breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: program but I've been doing it for long
enough that I can see what I want out of
[SPEAKER_00]: that but for a commercial for a production
breeding program I wouldn't even fuck with
[SPEAKER_00]: the mutant something slow growing
something shitty it goes it goes
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately I need highly productive
plants with vigor they recover from stress
[SPEAKER_00]: very well they can handle abuse that are
resistant to bugs resistant to mildew find
[SPEAKER_00]: those sort of straight sort of traits and
I say this a lot set yourself up for
[SPEAKER_00]: success don't fuck with those number five
males or females get them out of the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: get rid of them then when you've narrowed
it down to one or two solid males flower
[SPEAKER_00]: that one out all the way let it go 60 or
70 days and see what it does does it
[SPEAKER_00]: change colors on you does it make
trichomes do those trichomes build up on
[SPEAKER_00]: one part of the plant or another like what
do you see when it goes longer does it get
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiencies does it start bulking up at
the end those traits are gonna pass over
[SPEAKER_00]: in the progeny so let it go see what
you've got maybe narrow it down to one or
[SPEAKER_00]: two and then let those last two go like 70
days and see what's the best out of those
[SPEAKER_00]: something will speak to you in most cases
something will speak to you and you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong because it's like choosing I don't
know it's like choosing cake or ice cream
[SPEAKER_00]: both are fucking delicious and if you
choose cake you get to eat cake and if you
[SPEAKER_00]: choose ice cream you get to eat ice cream
you didn't fucking lose you're gonna have
[SPEAKER_00]: a good time you get to grow out a bunch of
seeds you get to make a project to get to
[SPEAKER_00]: see what it does maybe maybe you did
choose the wrong cake or ice cream when
[SPEAKER_00]: the outcome grows and some of that stuff
grows like shit but this wasn't a
[SPEAKER_00]: life-or-death situation this was a fun
breeding project and guess what get to eat
[SPEAKER_00]: more cake and ice cream and try it again
so have fun with it grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_00]: breed with love set yourself up for
success pull those ugly males whenever you
[SPEAKER_00]: feel it is time to get rid of them there's
no need to keep them around like I said
[SPEAKER_00]: time space energy lights water soil real
estate all of that stuff adds up very
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly if it's a male plant that doesn't
reach your criteria if it's a female plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that doesn't reach your criteria get rid
of it use that space for something that is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to pay for itself it's got a it's
getting rent in your grow room for free
[SPEAKER_00]: let me keep going there is more to this it
says I've been taking detailed notes along
[SPEAKER_00]: the way and I have my plans mapped out for
what my potential outcome will be I expect
[SPEAKER_00]: so many surprises in your first breeding
program it's gonna be fun especially doing
[SPEAKER_00]: it from straight-up seeds gonna be so many
variables it says I've been growing a very
[SPEAKER_00]: long time but I've never ventured into
breeding until now my next hunt will be
[SPEAKER_00]: the machine from yourself to look for a
male as well once we get it into Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: whoo everybody is hyped up on the machine
