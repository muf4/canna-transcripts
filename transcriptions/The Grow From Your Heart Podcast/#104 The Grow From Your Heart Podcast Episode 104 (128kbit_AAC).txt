[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 104 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your source for cannabis news,
education, and conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, This My Friend is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to the Mystic Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're letting me use their music on my
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to Kat, Coop, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm back in the studio, you guys,
and I'm putting this episode out as a
[SPEAKER_00]: regular Monday episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're having a great Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes Mondays can be a real bitch,
so I hope I make it a little bit better
[SPEAKER_00]: with a fresh episode of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not Monday for you, whenever
you're listening to this, I hope you're
[SPEAKER_00]: having a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you've got a fat joint rolled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you got a blunt rolled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you got a dab ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you got a bowl packed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you got the vaporizer filled up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you got something going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're eating some edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're using some cannabis
lubrication or possibly a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: suppository.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever it is, I hope it's working great
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're working in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're driving in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you're doing, I'm hoping that I'm
making your day a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining me, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm back in the studio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last time I was on, I did an episode from
the car and I did a review on the G-Pen
[SPEAKER_00]: Slim Disposable Vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used the concentrate version.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was in the car, I gave this thing
kind of a shitty review, but let me tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you, that was a preemptive strike.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got home and I looked at it a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I had to do was pack the hash in a
little bit harder, press it down and heat
[SPEAKER_00]: it up a little bit, and it actually gave
me quite a few fat rips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to, what is it called,
withdraw my shitty review of this product
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm going to update it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give it four out of five
stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a vape pen that's disposable,
this is probably the best quality we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four out of five stars, because for a dab
or a wax hit or a concentrate hit,
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer a rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a rig for five stars,
but it's a good product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Colorado and you're picking
up some concentrates and you need
[SPEAKER_00]: something to smoke it through,
these little yellow vape pens that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to throw away when you're done,
I think these are an affordable and
[SPEAKER_00]: economical deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for this shitty review.
[SPEAKER_00]: My updated review says it's a quality
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give the whole nation a shout
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody in America, this is for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, Halloween just passed and guess how
many people reported finding
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis-laced candy in their children's
Halloween basket?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were zero reports of cannabis-laced
candy given out for Halloween this year,
[SPEAKER_00]: so a big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did the same shout out last year,
but I wanted to do it again because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, please don't ever give children,
animals, anybody cannabis-infused candy
[SPEAKER_00]: without their knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your pet's using it for medicine,
do that with discretion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't judge you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do make medicine for your dog now
that's infused with cannabis, but don't do
[SPEAKER_00]: it just to get your dog fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's rude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, keep us on a good streak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the recreational cannabis going well
for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, I was at the Champs Trade
Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listened to the other episode,
I'm sure you heard about that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I was at the Champs Trade Show over
the weekend, or it was actually during the
[SPEAKER_00]: week, and I noticed something.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a really tight-knit, really close
little community that travels around to
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the cannabis shows, and they set up
their booths, and they take great care of
[SPEAKER_00]: the customers and the community,
and they really represent the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: movement, the cannabis product movement,
the cannabis industry, and a positive
[SPEAKER_00]: light, and I just wanna give a big shout
out to all those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to point them out
specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were part of that cannabis movement
that comes to the events, that goes to the
[SPEAKER_00]: events, that is part of the product
development, the advancement of the
[SPEAKER_00]: products, if you're there showing your
face, if we see each other and high-five
[SPEAKER_00]: each other and don't even have to talk,
you're part of the crew that I'm talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we see each other and just nod at each
other, because we've seen each other so
[SPEAKER_00]: many times, you're part of the crew I'm
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys make these events happen,
and we kinda rely on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed that I find myself hovering
and lingering at those booths that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: there all the time, because we've become
comfortable, we've become friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you guys are also leaders,
and you're teaching the other booths and
[SPEAKER_00]: the other vendors how to do it,
so a big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much respect to the family that travels
around and does all of the events and
[SPEAKER_00]: supports each other, supports the
movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really great to see you guys every
time you show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome in Colorado all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever need anything when you're in
Colorado, let me know, and I will do my
[SPEAKER_00]: best to accommodate you fully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love and respect to the whole
cannabis community and industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also big shout out to all the people
that come and learn and meet me and greet
[SPEAKER_00]: me and shake my hand and high-five me and
ask me questions and thank me for my
[SPEAKER_00]: breathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy going to those events.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a refreshing time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so you guys, let's get down to
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the topic for the show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been bumping into people,
and they've been talking about why some
[SPEAKER_00]: people are able to take their cannabis to
the next level, and some people are stuck
[SPEAKER_00]: growing... It's not mid-grade,
but it's still not stellar cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I thought that I would write down some
of the reasons why your herb, not yours,
[SPEAKER_00]: but some herb, is not what we would
consider top-shelf product, and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: could talk about a few ways on how to
improve that and get your herb up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: top shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me work on my list here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a couple things written down.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, the main reason I
find that cannabis is not able to be
[SPEAKER_00]: considered top-shelf product is because it
has been over-fertilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are thinking that they can
add more fertilizer and feed it more,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're gonna get better product,
but actually what you're doing is you are
[SPEAKER_00]: pumping it full of nutrients that are
gonna affect the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be harder to flush that stuff
out in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that you put into your plants
will affect the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another big reason that I find a lot of
cannabis is not able to be considered
[SPEAKER_00]: top-shelf product is that it was not
properly flushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, your cannabis plants need to be
flushed for a minute at a minimum of 10
[SPEAKER_00]: days, preferably two full weeks before
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 10 to 14 days before you plan on
cutting down your plants, you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: start watering it with just clean water,
pHed at about 6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in there and just fill every pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill the whole pot with water so that it's
dripping out of the drain holes a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that 14 days before harvest,
and then let it dry up just like it
[SPEAKER_00]: normally would, and when you're gonna
water again, make sure you water it until
[SPEAKER_00]: it drips out of the pot a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't wanna give it any nutrients
for the last 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're an experienced grower,
there are a few things you can add at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end there, but I wouldn't recommend too
many things unless you really know what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where you're really going to start
affecting your flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you flush for at least 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you can over flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like you start flushing about
14 days before you think you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest and you feel like those plants can
go a few more days, don't worry,
[SPEAKER_00]: let them go a few more days.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be just fine, and they will taste
even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them finish up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them ripen up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them flush out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let all the nutrients come out,
and you'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you guys, you may see some yellowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope for some yellowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means you're flushing it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that you're getting all the
excess nutrients out of the leaves that
[SPEAKER_00]: are stored in the plants, and you're gonna
flush that right on out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that there aren't extra
nutrients left in the soil that the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means it's eaten all of its food,
and it's getting cleaned up, and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: almost time for harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I wanna take a step back and say
over-fertilization and not flushing are
[SPEAKER_00]: both possible even when you are using
organics, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic nutrients can still burn your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic nutrients can over-fertilize your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful when using organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can add the wrong... I mean,
think about the way that stuff smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're working with some organics,
it literally smells like a pile of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you over-fertilize it, it can make your
buds taste like a pile of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, not flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear a lot of people say they don't have
to flush because they used organic
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using your own super soil and
you know that you don't need to flush
[SPEAKER_00]: because you've been flushing the whole
time, you're an experienced grower and you
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're using a bottled nutrient or
some sort of organics or most amended
[SPEAKER_00]: soils, you're going to need to flush,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you flush even with organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you don't over-fertilize even
with organics, and this can make your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis better.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a bottled nutrient,
start with about half of what they
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend on the bottle, about half of the
dosage rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you see that you have a
deficiency, move up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can correct, you can always add,
but you can never subtract from what you
[SPEAKER_00]: fed your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't over-fertilize and do flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing that I see that makes
cannabis not able to be top shelf is a
[SPEAKER_00]: really poor trim job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would not believe how much very
well-grown cannabis I've seen that would
[SPEAKER_00]: have been top shelf if the grower would
have taken just a little bit more time to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure to take all those little tiny
leaves off, because we don't want to see
[SPEAKER_00]: any leaves when we're looking at the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to see trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to see resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to see just buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't even want to see any stick at
all, just the little tiny stick that
[SPEAKER_00]: sticks out of the bottom of the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all that we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're trimming, make sure you
take off all those little tiny pointy
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in there and clean that shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut all the little sticks out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut your sticks off of the big gigantic
buds and trim your weed to look like just
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look in a magazine, look online,
look what good quality bud looks like and
[SPEAKER_00]: trim it up like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can see an obvious leaf on there,
get in there with your scissors and clip
[SPEAKER_00]: it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in there with your thumbnail and knock
that off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trim your weed like connoisseur grade weed
and it will be top shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also wear rubber gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, when you're trimming your
cannabis, make sure that you wear rubber
[SPEAKER_00]: gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my opinion, top shelf herb is hand
trimmed and not machine trimmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got machine trimmed bud that won
a cannabis cup, I'm impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear rubber gloves, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever you're touching these buds,
whenever you're touching a product that
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody's going to smoke, make sure you
wear rubber gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not want to smoke your skin oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to hear your skin oil or your
skin moisture sizzle in my dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just so gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trim your weed, wear gloves and use
scissors, not a trim machine is something
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another thing that quite often deters
people's cannabis from being top shelf
[SPEAKER_00]: product is a very poor cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are trying to speed dry
their cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, the slower your buds dry,
the better they are going to taste,
[SPEAKER_00]: the better they are going to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your goal is to eventually grind up this
bud and either roll a joint out of it or
[SPEAKER_00]: pack a bowl or stuff it in your vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or most of us nowadays are going to stuff
it into a tube and turn it into BHO or a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of you are going to freeze it and turn
it into ice wax or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, let's think about what we're
trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, most of us are going to grind
up this herb and roll a fat joint out of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you smoke your joint,
you want it to smell good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to get you nice and stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: But something that you really want it to
do that you don't think about is that you
[SPEAKER_00]: want it to burn nice and smoothly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to burn evenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to burn and make a nice white
ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want it to burn into this hard
black charcoal looking thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That hard black charcoal that's in the
bottom of your bowl when you're done or
[SPEAKER_00]: that your joint turns into, that's
nutrients that weren't flushed out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I'm backing up a little bit,
but a lot of times a bad cure will make
[SPEAKER_00]: your buds not burn properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're curing your buds, you are
removing excess chlorophyll from the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are removing a water molecule from the
THC, which makes the THC more
[SPEAKER_00]: psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are also pulling chlorophyll,
which is making the plants taste better,
[SPEAKER_00]: making your buds taste better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a proper cure and not a speed dry is
very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: A proper cure will definitely affect the
way that your buds burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slowly drying your buds will suck out all
of that chlorophyll and it will suck the
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture out slowly and your buds will
burn very nice and smoothly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be nice and sticky and they will
burn very, very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an episode all about drying and
curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to pause right now and go see
exactly which number it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either 35 or 36.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me pause for one second and go see
what it is so that I can tell you to
[SPEAKER_00]: listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, you guys, it's episode number 35.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go listen to episode number 35 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast and learn all
[SPEAKER_00]: about properly drying and curing your
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, when it was episode 35,
it was called I Grow Culture, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: still on the same feed, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's episode number 35 and it's titled
number 35, Drying and Curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the formerly known as I Grow Culture
podcast, the now known as the Grow From
[SPEAKER_00]: Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the same feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm way off topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back in the game here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are talking about a poor cure is what
makes your buds not top shelf because they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't taste good and they do not burn
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, it is very possible to have
nice, sticky buds that are properly dried
[SPEAKER_00]: and cured that will burn like a champ,
stink up the whole fucking neighborhood
[SPEAKER_00]: and get you high as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So listen to the episode, learn how to
properly dry and cure the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing, don't try to speed dry your
weed, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not speed dry it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut it down, hang it upside down and let
it dry properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what that's going to give you a
huge advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, here is a major contributing factor
to why I feel like a lot of people's buds
[SPEAKER_00]: are not top shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, people really love to cut their
buds way too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let that shit grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because the packaging on your seed
package says that those seeds will be done
[SPEAKER_00]: in 60 days does not mean that you have to
cut them down in 60 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get yourself a nice scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some sort of a scope where you can
magnify the size of your trichomes to
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can see how many of them have
turned opaque, how many of them have gone
[SPEAKER_00]: cloudy, and how many of them are amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start seeing about 30% amber
trichomes is when it's time to harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are just cutting weed down
way too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trimming it like shit,
they're speed drying it, and then they're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get top shelf prices for it,
and they feel bad and they feel let down
[SPEAKER_00]: when they're not able to sell their
product for a top shelf price.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to let it finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've really got to let it finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't even taste right, it doesn't
get you high enough, and you're not even
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the right weight if you don't let
it finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: That last week or two is really where it
starts packing on weight on a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let the weed grow longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quit cutting it too early, and it will
really improve the quality of your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, get a scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start watching the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quit paying so much attention to your
calendar, and pay a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand you're on a schedule,
but the plants are the boss here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you want A plus top shelf buds,
this is what you're gonna have to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so don't cut too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now also, you're going to have to pay a
lot more attention to the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can tell, I can tell by looking at the
finished product if the room got too hot,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if the room got too humid, or if you
had some sort of bug infestation,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if there was some sort of struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: A professional grower can tell by looking
at your finished buds what the problem
[SPEAKER_00]: was.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your buds are airy and fluffy,
you probably got too hot in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the buds have this weird texture to
them, it probably got too humid in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can spot bug damage on those leaves that
you're not cutting off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see the spider mite marks on those
leaves, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay a lot of attention to the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get good control of your rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to set up that room to have
proper airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need air exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get the old stale air out of
there, and you need to get fresh air in so
[SPEAKER_00]: that that plant can breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to be trapped in a stale,
humid-ass closet all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neither do your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also don't want to be too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get the plants too hot,
they start foxtailing, the buds start
[SPEAKER_00]: getting wispy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like in the summertime,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, you know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it gets all hot, your junk starts
swinging down all low, it's just trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: cool itself down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants will do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts spreading its legs all far so
that it can get some air, and it starts
[SPEAKER_00]: foxtailing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's from too much heat, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you get your grow room under
control, you will be able to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: better cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the bugs under control, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have bugs on your plants,
your plants don't have to spend all of
[SPEAKER_00]: their energy fighting off these predators,
and they're able to use all of their
[SPEAKER_00]: energy into producing delicious,
tasty trichomes and resin and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let the plants focus on what they're
supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so pay attention to the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the room under control is the point of
that part right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another reason why a lot of cannabis
that I see cannot be considered top-shelf
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is because the grower basically
forgot the general rules of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He forgot to think about his lights,
his air, his water, or his soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, as growers, we get complacent,
we get cocky, we get egotistical,
[SPEAKER_00]: we get overconfident, we get ahead of
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit happens, and sometimes that's
when you start worrying about something
[SPEAKER_00]: that is really obscure, and then you
forget about something that was really
[SPEAKER_00]: basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying some new trick that's really
going to improve the crop, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This new trick is going to make everything
fucking magical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be amazing, but as I did
that, I forgot to pH the nutrient solution
[SPEAKER_00]: before I watered it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something stupid like that, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pay attention to the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to your lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to your water, and pay
attention to your soil, and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: should be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, pay attention to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the leaves every day for bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do all that stuff, but remember the
basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need good lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have good lighting,
you can't grow quality buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow quality bud under a small
lamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't go, you know, you can use a
250.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to grow cannabis
cup-winning buds underneath a 250-watt
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may do okay under a four.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got potential under a six,
but I really think if you're going to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cup-winning, top shelf,
A-grade buds, you need at least 1,000-watt
[SPEAKER_00]: light, at least 1,000-watt light,
and you don't want to try to put more than
[SPEAKER_00]: about a four-by-four or a five-by-five
floor pattern worth of plants underneath
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want your canopy to be nice and tight
under that 1,000-watt light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light is the main nutrient for your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the plants want more than
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have enough lighting and also make sure
you have the right spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Air.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sort of discussed air before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have too much humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have too much heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to find a way to replenish the CO2 by
replacing the air in the room very often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've mentioned this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're pHing your nutrient
solution before you're feeding it to your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're checking your PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're using good quality water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can start with reverse osmosis
water, that would be ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you remember to check the pH,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people simply have overlooked pH
balancing their water before they add it
[SPEAKER_00]: to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want that about six-five-ish,
depending on what strains you're running,
[SPEAKER_00]: depends on how far into flower you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But make sure you've got your nutrients
measured properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not overfeeding the plants and
you've got them pH adjusted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your soil, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to use a good quality soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't be packing your dirt too tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need some aeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need some air in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need some drainage in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use good soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't overlook that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the basics that you guys need to
pay attention to that you may have
[SPEAKER_00]: forgotten that sometimes I forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm guilty of this as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all small things that I'm trying
to remind you about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget the basics of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can always refer to the old rule called
laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lights, air, water, and soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never forget those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, of course, you got to add love in
there because I think plants grow with a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of love.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to love the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way to improve your cannabis,
and this is going to sound like I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to make a sales pitch here,
but you need good quality genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys, unless you've got a top-shelf
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to branch here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, quit saying strands.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a strand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't smoke different strands.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't grow different strands.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really want to be difficult and
technical, they are known as varietals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, if you really want to be an asshole,
you would call it a cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: A specific phenotype of a specific strain
would be a cultivar, but I digress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use good genetics, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow a good strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're stuck on growing that strain and
you can't get it to be what you want it to
[SPEAKER_00]: be, maybe it's time to buy a pack of seeds
and run those seeds and find the one in
[SPEAKER_00]: there that does what you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're simply held back by the
quality of the clones you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be your issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use good genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do some research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some seeds from a reputable breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not sponsored by thedankteam.com
currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not pay for any ads, but I can
fully recommend my friends at thedankteam
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have reliable seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to say it all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get rare dankness, Mile High,
Canaventure, Sin City, Sour Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are just a few of the people that I
would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I read genetics if you can get
your hands on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get yourself some good quality seeds from
a reputable breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the best one out of there for you,
and maybe that will help you improve the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's just that clone that you're
growing isn't going to get any better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe its potential is only 17% THC no
matter what you do to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a genetic thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: My genetics say that I'm not going to be
able to jump six feet high no matter what
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't jump high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a white man that can't jump.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just my genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes these plants aren't going to go
much further than their potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get good genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about lights, air, water,
and soil, but what we got to think about
[SPEAKER_00]: is do not overlook the vegetative stage of
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: From day one, when you get those clones,
when you crack those seeds, from the very
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of the grow, you are working on
the quality of that cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may just say, hey, it's veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can just put it under these weak lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need a lot of good air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to feed it good nutrients,
but really, good teenagers and good kids
[SPEAKER_00]: make good adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why doesn't the same shit work with
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you need to take really good care
of those baby plants because that is the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to create a nice root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to create a nice thick stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a nice node structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need nice strong supported branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need nice topping.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a nice canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need nice pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take very good care of the plants in
the veg phase and you will be very
[SPEAKER_00]: prepared for happy healthy plants when you
go into the flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay more attention to the veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people overlook the
vegetative stage of cannabis growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a way that you could definitely
improve the quality of your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, I've got one more thing
that I really think would help improve the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of your finished product and it
will also help improve the quality of your
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates if you're a hash maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something you really need to do is clean
your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that the floor is clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that the tops of your light
reflectors are dusted off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that the air conditioner gets
cleaned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that all the blowers and the
carbon filters, the tops of them
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes, they collect a little dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that your carbon filter covers
get cleaned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, you got to go in there and clean
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a shop vac with a good
filter on it, get in there and shop vac
[SPEAKER_00]: the corners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean the fuck out of that grow room
because every piece of dust and
[SPEAKER_00]: particulate that is in the air will end up
sticking to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever taken a picture of a
cannabis plant and there's a little hair
[SPEAKER_00]: in there, you understand exactly how bad
anything and everything will stick to your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants while they're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll never be able to get the hair out
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll never be able to get the dust out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean up the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got long hair, if you've got a
beard, think about keeping that shit out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plants too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't talk too much shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got dreadlocks that go almost to my
knees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to wear a big ass hat just to go
in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to be sanitary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to be clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to be dust free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to clean up all that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that stuff is going to stick to
your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that stuff is going to end up in your
finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that stuff is going to end up in your
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just think about all the dust and whatever
that is, it's soil and whatever else
[SPEAKER_00]: you're dragging around in the grow room,
that's all going to end up in your
[SPEAKER_00]: finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, so I'm going to do a
quick recap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone through my list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go real quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want your buds to be a little bit
better than they are, maybe you could pay
[SPEAKER_00]: more attention to your feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you could flush a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could possibly trim up your buds a
little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably improve the quality of
your drying and curing method,
[SPEAKER_00]: which all you'd have to do is listen to
episodes of number 35, and that'll give
[SPEAKER_00]: you huge steps on how to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably let your plants grow a
little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the harvest date.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably pay more attention to
the room and dial the room in a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably work on not having
bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another good way to improve the quality of
your cannabis is to remember the basics
[SPEAKER_00]: and remember the fundamentals of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another huge way to improve the quality of
your grow is to use quality genetics from
[SPEAKER_00]: a reputable breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another good way is to not overlook your
veg phase and, of course, clean up the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, of course, we've got a little side
note here that says good lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're using proper lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you guys, good nutrients,
good quality nutrients will get you a long
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure your plants are properly fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few things that I think would
work with every feed regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wanted to add dehydrated coconut
water and also yucca extract, those things
[SPEAKER_00]: will definitely improve your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: With almost any feed regimen, if you're
going hydro, you're going to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out how to add those to your hydro
regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit different, but if you've
got a soil mix going on, those things will
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely make your plants taste better.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants are burning and making
black ashes, you're probably
[SPEAKER_00]: over-nutrienting, over-feeding,
over-fertilizing is what I think I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to say, and you're not flushing
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work on those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, that's all I've got for this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start wrapping up the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be back in about, I'm not going to
do a midweek.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will be back Monday for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of few things planned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to link up with our friend Fox.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in Colorado right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a busy man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is elusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've chased him down for a day and it was
hard to find him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did not record with him yet,
but we will in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: If everything goes my way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'd love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you found me on the social media,
I am on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at GFYH podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's grow from your heart on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the I read genetics Instagram page.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're almost at 19,000 followers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be really cool if you clicked on that
and put me up there at 19,000 followers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So follow I read genetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I think that's all I've got for
you this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a big shout out to my Ninja
Spence until next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys take a fat dab and give your mom
a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was said,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want you to know marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: I eat soap and be free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so let it be.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want you to know marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: I eat soap and be free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so let it be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I eat soap and be free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so let it be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I eat soap and be free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so let it be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I eat soap and be free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so let it be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I eat soap and be free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so let it be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I eat soap and be free.
Just so let it be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I eat soap and be free.
[SPEAKER_01]: I eat soap and be free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so let it be.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want you to know marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: I eat soap and be free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so let it be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody said, listen up, the truth is to
be told.
[SPEAKER_01]: Open your eyes, there's beauty to behold.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the you, if you consider the old?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wake in the world and consider your soul.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the cloud if you understand the
lining?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is the king if you consider the
lineage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know it's him, so don't continue
denying him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it freestyle if I consider the line?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then can't figure the timing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Na just pick the rhyme scheme.
[SPEAKER_01]: With no trouble to my mind, really,
silly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're inna me garden strong This is
not a marijuana strong They don't want you
[SPEAKER_01]: to know marijuana I'd serve and be free
Just so let it be They don't want you to
[SPEAKER_01]: know marijuana I'd serve and be free Just
so let it be And I let them know That the
[SPEAKER_01]: herb is a lifeline Now they would never
want you to know And they would never want
[SPEAKER_01]: you to know So be free!
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would never want you to know
Never want you to know No, no,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, no, no Never want you to know Never
want you to know Never want you to know
