Arise or some Sonic Boom, or maybe you
[SPEAKER_00]: want some Dragon Punch, they've got that
available right now at seedsherenow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start this podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a gigantic dab of Stardog
Ambrosia Batter from our friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label says this product contains 61.9%
THC and 73.6% total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stardog is one of my favorite strains to
grow and definitely one of my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: strains to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at
Apothecary Farms for the delicious Stardog
[SPEAKER_00]: Ambrosia Batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to go over a
really long listener email that contains
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to briefly cover each of those
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let's do a few shout
outs to our friends on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big ladies first shout out to
my friend Miss Mel, a big gigantic Grow

but in the past couple of episodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have talked about my seeds being
available on seedsherenow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for being patient with me after the
holiday weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time to officially announce that Iri

[SPEAKER_00]: The Golden Goat BX sold out in just a
couple of hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do have a lot of a rise and they have
a lot of other great varieties available
[SPEAKER_00]: and I will be restocking that Golden Goat
very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you check out seedsherenow
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world at the start of
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said I was going to read a long email
with multiple questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into that portion of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got a cannabis cold,
culture or a cannabis cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: question, and you would like me to read
that question on the show, you can send me
[SPEAKER_00]: an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message for today's episode goes just
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dear Rasta Jeff, this is my second email
to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first message was read on episode 350.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cheers, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are welcome to read my name out loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this message comes from our friend John
and it goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard you call out for music on podcast
400 and I will see what I can do for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I checked out fish to get an idea of what
you like and I will see what I can come up
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that's pretty cool of you,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to make too much of a fishy
sound for an intro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would prefer something kind of reggae
kind of up tempo reggae kind of kicks in
[SPEAKER_00]: the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember how we used to start it with that
beat that would just kick off right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that kicks down the door and
says, hey, it's time for a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something kind of reggae like if you made
a fish type song, I will certainly play
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, I did ask for music on episode
400.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not get a new theme song.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody out there would like to make a
theme song, like I said, something reggae,
[SPEAKER_00]: something that kicks in the door,
something that has not been posted to
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube before, because if you have
already posted it to YouTube, YouTube will
[SPEAKER_00]: flag me when I post it and say that I am
stealing your content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got to be fresh original material
if you'd like me to play it on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so far, John, you are off to a great
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are making me an intro that probably
sounds like fish and I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will play it on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will make a great vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says a few grow questions and this is
where it gets fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Question number A, budget grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I control humidity when the lights
go out?
[SPEAKER_00]: When it is time for the girls to go to
bed, there is always a huge humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: spike, which is difficult to control on a
budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a cheap 100 pound, not the weight,
but the price, 100 pound dehumidifier,
[SPEAKER_00]: which removes moisture from the air and is
fine whilst the lights are on,
[SPEAKER_00]: but fails to control the humidity during
darkness, humidity spikes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be worse without the
dehumidifier, but it struggles to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: RH down to desired levels during darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a fact of life for all gardeners
unless you have access to serious
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't afford a better dehumidifier or
the power to run it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any tips for a novice grower on a brutal
budget?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this listener has a very common
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the lights go out and their grow
environment, the humidity spikes
[SPEAKER_00]: drastically and this person is getting
concerned that it may cause a problem in
[SPEAKER_00]: their grow and they need a way to control
that humidity without spending a ton of
[SPEAKER_00]: money, perhaps without spending any money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said that the budget is low.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cannot afford a better dehumidifier
or even the power to run it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about things that we could
do, things that need to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I would suggest is maybe
turn on the dehumidifier earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know when you were starting that
dehumidifier, so I don't know when it is
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to remove the moisture from the
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your problem is happening right when the
lights go off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if we start turning on the
dehumidifier an hour before the lights go
[SPEAKER_00]: off, we can start prepping the environment
and removing some of the air beforehand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what's going to happen is the lights
are going to go off and the plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to start respiring and transpiring
and they're going to let out moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe we can remove enough moisture
from the air before the lights go off to
[SPEAKER_00]: where when the lights do go off,
it is not such a drastic swing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe when the lights are on,
you're running about 50% humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe 40% humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the lights go off, you're probably
peaking up to 60, 70, maybe 80% humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if we start turning on that
dehumidifier one, maybe two hours before
[SPEAKER_00]: lights go off, we can reduce the amount of
moisture in that air low enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: compensate for that giant swing when it
does happen when the lights go off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to be my first plan of
attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to get ahead of the humidity problem
before it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know when it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we can remove moisture from the air
before that time comes and give ourselves
[SPEAKER_00]: a head start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I don't know how large your grow space
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a lot of details on your grow
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many plants are in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what size containers those
plants are in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much moisture you were
adding to the room or how frequently that
[SPEAKER_00]: is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the small amount of information I
have got, I don't have a lot to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what size that environment is,
I think you need to install some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction fan to remove the humidity from
that environment and send it somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a small grow tent,
something like maybe a four inch
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction fan, maybe a computer fan,
up in the top corner would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything to help pull some of that stale
humid air out of that environment would be
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you have something larger,
you may need a larger extraction fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the size of your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much moisture is in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But your best bet next to another
dehumidifier would be some way of
[SPEAKER_00]: extracting that humid air from that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like a squirrel cage blower or
something like a vortex fan or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like a can fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something to move that old air out of the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying I don't know how large your
environment is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The size of your grow space is going to
determine how much air you need to move
[SPEAKER_00]: out of that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when you go sucking air out of the
room, you start thinking about odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you start thinking about a
carbon filter, which is when this starts
[SPEAKER_00]: to get expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've got neighbors or
people that you need to conceal the aroma
[SPEAKER_00]: from, but if you were extracting your odor
outside of your home or to somewhere other
[SPEAKER_00]: people may come in contact with that air,
you need to clean the aroma out of that
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will need a carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a full episode on carbon
filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Episode number 430 is all about a carbon
filter and where to place that filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That lesson would apply greatly to your
question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know you were on a budget,
but this is what I would do if this were
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get the appropriate size
extraction fan for your grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would try to hang that extraction fan in
the top center of my flowering room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get it as high as possible and
in the dead center, that is your best bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that ceiling space is
limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that height is limited and I
understand that things are heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't always mount things to the
ceiling, but that is the best place for
[SPEAKER_00]: this extraction fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would hang that fan from the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would run ducting from that ceiling
to the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would cut the appropriate size hole
in the wall and I would run that ducting
[SPEAKER_00]: through the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I don't know where it needs to go once
it gets out of that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need to run it even further down
another hallway?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that going outside at that point?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole nother thing to think
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now you are sucking air through that
blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're blowing it down the ducting and it
is going out of your grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to remove heat and you are
going to remove humidity by doing so.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, you are going to be
blasting odoriferous cannabis scented air
[SPEAKER_00]: straight through that ducting wherever
that air ends up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is when I recommend a carbon
filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend you hang a carbon
filter, then your blower, then your
[SPEAKER_00]: ducting out of the grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I do understand that earlier you said
you don't have a budget to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you cannot afford a better
dehumidifier and you said you cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: afford the power to run it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't afford a big expensive blower
and a carbon filter, maybe something like
[SPEAKER_00]: a small computer fan, anything that will
just blow some air out of that room from
[SPEAKER_00]: the top would be helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I understand that buying a blower and
buying a carbon filter and buying ducting
[SPEAKER_00]: does cost money and I really don't have a
more affordable solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: That humid air either needs to be sucked
out or blown out of that room or treated
[SPEAKER_00]: by the dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are basically your two options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other things we can think about are where
is excess water coming from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any standing water in that
room?
[SPEAKER_00]: After you water, is there water left in
your catch tray or your runoff saucer or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you're using?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there water left in the room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can use a shot vac and suck that
up and get that out of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that will help, and this may
sound crazy, is a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those leaves aren't there, they can't
let out water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that may be another way to help combat
your humidity issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully one of those options work,
maybe a combination of those things will
[SPEAKER_00]: help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry I don't have a really easy
solution that will fix this that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you may have to spend a few
bucks on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do go with the blower route,
I highly recommend that carbon filter
[SPEAKER_00]: because a carbon filter, a blower,
and some ducting is much more affordable
[SPEAKER_00]: than a court case for an illegal grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, there are a lot of questions in
this email, so let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Question number B says, low stress
training.
[SPEAKER_00]: When should it start?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a method to the madness?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are Scrognets worth the hassle if LST has
been done properly?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there anything you should not do
when low stress training?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start LST as soon as those plants
are thick enough and robust enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: handle being cracked, being twisted,
being manipulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like the plant can take it,
go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I would wait for them to get about
the thickness of a Bic pen or a pencil
[SPEAKER_00]: before I start cracking on them,
but you can start as soon as you feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: they can take a little bit of abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is going to be strain and maybe
phenotype specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is a method to the madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what type of low stress
training you are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are very many different options that
you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to grab the plant and give it a
little twist and pop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The method to that is to grab it kind of
close to the stock, put your other hand
[SPEAKER_00]: above it and twist and just pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll hear it pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I do like that thing we used to
do in school and we tried to decide who
[SPEAKER_00]: goes first in baseball.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put your hand on the bat and the next
guy puts his hand above yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next guy puts his hand above yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I measure my crack distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go crack and I put my hand above it,
crack, put my hand above it, crack and I
[SPEAKER_00]: just work my way up the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my method to that madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start at the main stock of the plant and
I go all the way up until it gets kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: skinny until I'm up to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I do that to every single branch
starting at the lowest branch and work my
[SPEAKER_00]: way up that branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then to the next branch and work my way
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pop the shit out of those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the method to my madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, there are several different methods
and approaches to low stress training.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you have a goal in mind and you
were observing what is happening,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a method to your madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just go in there and do a bunch of
different shit and don't pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're gonna do something to plant A
and something to plant B, have a reason,
[SPEAKER_00]: make a note of what you did, why you did
it and which plant you did it to and then
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a method to your madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next question is, are Scrog nets worth
it if the LST is done correctly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I really like a Scrog net.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like when the time comes when the
top buds start getting kind of heavy and
[SPEAKER_00]: floppy, if you've got one, two,
maybe even three layers of Scrog nets,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't need to get in there with a
bunch of sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully your buds are going to get so
big and fat that your branches can't
[SPEAKER_00]: support them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even after all of that low stress
training, you're still gonna get big fat
[SPEAKER_00]: giant buds that those sticks are not ready
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: In any commercial environment which I am
responsible for, I always run a screen of
[SPEAKER_00]: green system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually set up one screen to kind of
spread the plants apart a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second screen is to kind of guide them
to get them going straight up to put them
[SPEAKER_00]: in the position where I want the branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third one is to support those big
gigantic floppy buds that will happen
[SPEAKER_00]: around week five, six, seven and then
continue all the way through week nine or
[SPEAKER_00]: ten whenever we harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just gonna get bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna get floppier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to get in there with a
bunch of sticks and bamboo sticks and
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato cages and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those screens really are worth
their weight in gold and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely worth the hassle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get good at hanging them up,
they're not that hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost becomes as easy as making a bed
once you learn how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, I like to
find another guy that's as tall as myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm six five.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can find another guy that's like six
foot or six two, we can hang up trellis
[SPEAKER_00]: all day, no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is super fast and super easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then to wrap up question B, he asks,
is there anything you would not do when
[SPEAKER_00]: low stress training?
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, the only way to learn what not to
do is to do some shit and see it go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the best way to learn anything in
a garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try some shit, experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you try three or four things and one
or two of them, absolutely fail,
[SPEAKER_00]: those are the things not to do again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't know what else to tell you
not to do because I don't know what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see your devious little mind
plotting what's gonna happen in that grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know what to tell you not to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I can tell you is to think twice
before you do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always cut later, but you can't
put shit back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're gonna do something crazy,
look at the plants, think about what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think to yourself, why am I going to do
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is my desired outcome?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it going to look like immediately?
[SPEAKER_00]: Immediately after I do that, what is it
gonna look like in 12 hours after I do
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it gonna look like in three days?
[SPEAKER_00]: What will it be like in two weeks after I
do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is this going to affect my final
outcome of my finished product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then before you do that crazy shit you're
thinking about, go smoke a joint,
[SPEAKER_00]: go for a walk, go play on the internet,
then come back and rethink your shit and
[SPEAKER_00]: see if it is something you really wanna
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like I said a moment ago,
you can always cut more off, but you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: glue leaves or plant parts back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about everything twice before
you're gonna do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke a joint, think about it again,
maybe ask a friend, maybe send me an
[SPEAKER_00]: email, maybe go look on a forum,
get an educated decision before you do
[SPEAKER_00]: anything crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is what I would say not to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do anything ridiculous without
thoroughly, thoroughly thinking it
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we are ripping right through
this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's work on question number C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Question number C says, best seed company
in the UK or Europe for reliable genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any recommendations?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to try your Lemon Jeffrey and
Golden Goat, but I have a difficulty
[SPEAKER_00]: sourcing them in the UK or Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that frustration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get messages like this every day that
people overseas would like to get their
[SPEAKER_00]: hands on some iry genetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best advice I've got for you there is
to try seedsherenow.com, oregoneliteseeds
[SPEAKER_00]: .com or dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be able to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not know their shipping policies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not know where they are willing to
ship seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're interested in strictly iry
genetics, those are the three top vendors
[SPEAKER_00]: that I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that is seedsherenow.com,
oregoneliteseeds.com and dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are my three top vendors right now
that may be able to get products to you in
[SPEAKER_00]: the UK or Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, even if you do contact a vendor that
can get seeds to you in the UK or in
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe, you will not be able to get any
Lemon Jeffrey or feminized Golden Goat
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds until at least the middle of July.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds are not ready yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are currently sold out at almost
every outlet that I know of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am making more right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are almost done, but they will not be
available anywhere until July.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's work our way into
question number D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Question D on this email goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Upgrade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you start with a one meter square
budget tent, a 400 watt light,
[SPEAKER_00]: a small dehumidifier and a four inch
extractor fan, at some point you will want
[SPEAKER_00]: to upgrade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've just given me a really good
idea of your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish you would have started with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have had more accurate,
better, more clear advice, but this is
[SPEAKER_00]: where we are now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, can you give me any
advice on upgrading?
[SPEAKER_00]: As many upgrades I suspect will only give
you tiny gains and maybe rather pointless
[SPEAKER_00]: unless you are upping your game altogether
to a much larger grow with commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: aspirations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any big gains for small grows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says, by the way, I appreciate
that the best gains are achieved by
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing and loving your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understanding the plants, developing a
relationship with each cultivar is the
[SPEAKER_00]: best way to improve and grow top notch
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's look at the equipment you've
already got.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a decent light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have got a small dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you need a larger
dehumidifier already is the thing you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to step up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a four inch extractor fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you need a better extractor fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the two things for you to focus
on right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says at some point you're going to want
to upgrade to a better light and a better
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidifier and a better tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily a larger tent,
but you'd like advice on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally start with lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to buy the highest quality light I
can afford and the most efficient light
[SPEAKER_00]: for my space.
[SPEAKER_00]: In today's modern market, grow lights are
constantly changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would try to find the most efficient,
most effective light that I can afford for
[SPEAKER_00]: that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I would start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would work on cooling that area and
controlling the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would work on dehumidification and
removing stale hot air out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to need that extractor fan
and a carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the next thing I would work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would work on cooling the
environment in which that tent is in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't necessarily cool the inside of
the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would cool the room which the tent is
living in and that air would then cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: into that tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would start with lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would work on airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would focus on cooling the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we've got our light and our
environment dialed in, it is time to work
[SPEAKER_00]: on automation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first step to automation is knowing
what is going on in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll need something that can monitor
your environment, something that can pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to temperature and humidity at
all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I like to have some sort of a device
that can react to those inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I've got some sort of a device that
tells me, hey Rasta Jeff, it is now too
[SPEAKER_00]: humid in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, I want something to trigger
on to reduce that humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good example would be a SmartB unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can plug a SmartB stinger into any
wall outlet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can plug your dehumidifier into
that SmartB.
[SPEAKER_00]: You plug it into spot number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You assign number one to dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you tell your SmartB sensor,
hey, I want it to be 50% humidity in this
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it gets higher than that, turn on that
dehumidifier and it will do that for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The monitor will pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as that hits 52% humidity in that
room, it'll say, hey, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff wants it 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to turn on slot number A on that
stinger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your dehumidifier will fire up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will suck out the humidity in that
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also put an extraction fan on that
same stinger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw it on slot number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it on dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way when it gets too humid,
your dehumidifier comes on and your
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction fan comes on and now you're
dehumidifying that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you've got good equipment,
I like to add monitors followed by
[SPEAKER_00]: automation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think monitors and automation make
things very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis plants love consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you automate simple things like
watering and dehumidifying, that saves you
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of time for doing other things in
the grow like the low stress training,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the popping and twisting,
like defoliating, like scouting for bugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: like all of the other things that get
pushed aside because we're too busy doing
[SPEAKER_00]: things we could have and should have
automated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would start with the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would work on climate control and
air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would go to monitoring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would work on automation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you really want to step it up,
it is time to start adding CO2 to your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to supplement CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ambient CO2 in most environments on earth
is around 400 PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our cannabis plants can thrive at much
higher levels of CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will grow more rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will grow with more vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will become larger with less time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So supplementing, augmenting CO2 in your
grow environment is a great way to improve
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will increase the harvest weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will decrease grow time and you will
increase overall quality of your finished
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that is the equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also need to make sure that you are
feeding the best nutrients you can feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to make sure that each feed is
dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I suggest good pH pins and EC
meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also recommend you calibrate those
devices regularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those devices don't do you any good if
they are not calibrated properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a list of options and things
you can do to upgrade your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that grow room equipment is
constantly changing and evolving,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially with legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are able to research more.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are able to advertise their product
as a cannabis specific product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things are developing and changing
rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do a lot of research and buy quality
products that you think will have
[SPEAKER_00]: longevity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fall for gimmicky shit in the grow
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to find a company that will answer you
when you send them an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to find a company that will respond to
you if you've got a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Customer service is huge in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I keep saying it, no matter how much
great shit you buy, nothing ever will make
[SPEAKER_00]: up for building a relationship with the
plant and understanding the plants we are
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that will probably improve your
garden more.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than anything is a solid grow book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go buy a cannabis specific grow book that
was written by a reputable cannabis grower
[SPEAKER_00]: and a reputable author.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once you've got that book,
the next step is to read the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those books do you no good if you buy them
and sit them on that bookshelf by the
[SPEAKER_00]: toilet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been to your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked up that grow Bible that is right
by your toilet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spine of that book has never been
cracked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking open it and read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to do you any good sitting
there on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: The knowledge isn't going to fly out of
the book into your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to open it and read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once you are done reading that grow
book, the next step is to buy another grow
[SPEAKER_00]: book from a different author and read that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then combine the knowledge you got from
both books and develop your own
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding for these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understanding the plants we are growing
and having a solid goal will be more
[SPEAKER_00]: useful than any piece of equipment you
could buy at any grow store on Amazon or
[SPEAKER_00]: any sort of wizardry you could ever find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Develop a relationship with each cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Touch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that is free and that is probably
the best way to improve your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, that was a good rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wraps up the portion question of this
email, but there is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Section three says, please give a big
shout out for White Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, White Mike, you're getting another
shout out on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for you to come be on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I heard that a few listeners did
not relish Mike's whiter industry view.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not agree at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love White Mike's contribution to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: People like Mike, and yourself,
remove the stigma of a bunch of potheads,
[SPEAKER_00]: justifying their own habits by presenting
a mature, thoughtful, and well reasoned
[SPEAKER_00]: approach to the industry and the culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that is a great sentence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of wanted to start the show to
break some of the myths, dispel some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the rumors about cannabis, kind of take
some of the fear away from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm glad that you see that we're
trying to do it in a professional manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, this helps to break down the
bigoted views and any lingering stigma
[SPEAKER_00]: from a hundred plus years of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I particularly loved episode 400 in which
you, Mike, and another guest discussed the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that you do not like about the
business, regulations, and the culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your guest was not a fan of dab rigs
because they looked like drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was our friend Clint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Clint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're listening to the podcast,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was such a good discussion
to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no issue with dab rigs,
but I totally get the look like drugs view
[SPEAKER_00]: that those opposed or without much
knowledge will fastly, will fasten upon to
[SPEAKER_00]: justify their agenda.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sometimes a dab rig can kind of look
like you're doing other drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got this big glass bowl on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm heating it with the torch and then I'm
dropping shit into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does look a little suspect if you don't
know what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understand your view and I do
understand Clint's view on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you listen to episode 400.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to hear more about that,
we're going to keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, it says this sort of grownup
warts and all approach is what the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry needs more of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he wraps it up by saying,
if necessary, I will set up a GoFundMe
[SPEAKER_00]: page to save White Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: White Mike isn't going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's always invited on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: White Mike is consumed by his family life.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just loves being a dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: He loves being a good husband.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he is always there doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure we'll break him free pretty soon
and get him over here on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: No need to save White Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I'm not going to stop you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to make a GoFundMe page for
White Mike, I would not be a good friend
[SPEAKER_00]: if I tried to stop you from doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get White Mike a GoFundMe page
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hear that, Mike?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got some money coming, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike is doing fine, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike will be on the show pretty soon here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part four says, if either you and or White
Mike ever venture over the pond to the UK,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you both have a place to stay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he says where?
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, just drop me a line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says, I have had 400 free training
lessons from you and you are both welcome
[SPEAKER_00]: to stay at my expense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that sounds fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Mike, let's go overseas and have a
good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike was just over there recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not get to join him, but Mike went
to France for his birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked a little bit about that on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part number five says, if you ever want a
foreign contributor to your shows,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be more than happy to contribute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you just did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on to say that it would be
interesting to get a non-U.S.-Canadian
[SPEAKER_00]: attitude as to what's happening all over
our continent, which I do agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be neat to get a little over the
pond kind of a rebate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got some recording equipment,
maybe we could work out a little brief
[SPEAKER_00]: segment, maybe occasionally just drop in a
little prerecorded part.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're able to do that, keep in touch
with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear your ideas on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he does wrap up the email with cheers
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the good work looking to another
400 shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he wraps it up with kind regards from
John.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, John, thank you for the great
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to bringing you another
400 episodes.
