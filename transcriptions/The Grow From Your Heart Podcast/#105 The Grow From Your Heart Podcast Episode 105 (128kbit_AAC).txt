[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate you being on the show I'm

I refreshed and now it's gone So it'll
[SPEAKER_02]: come back up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude technique can be the best and
it can be the worst thing on the planet
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, dude, thanks for coming to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a news article.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't find it on my computer I'm not
getting it going here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I promise you but I don't even need the
news article talk about it something weird
[SPEAKER_02]: happened here recently in Colorado Snoop
Dogg has signed a deal with live.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it is Spencer here in Colorado to
produce a strain of cannabis and market
[SPEAKER_02]: this cannabis under the Snoop Dogg name at
live Well, then that sounds like a really
[SPEAKER_02]: cool thing But wills looking at me and
shaking his head kind of to the side kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of like if you guys have heard the show in
the past We've reported about live.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well putting a whole bunch of shitty ass
pesticides in their cannabis If you come
[SPEAKER_02]: to Colorado and you shop at live Well,
you'll be disappointed because it's pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: much like going to the shittiest street
dealer you can ever find and buying the
[SPEAKER_02]: shittiest dirt Weed you can find for way
too much money and it always seems old
[SPEAKER_02]: like old weed you can yeah Yeah,
just old and it's probably because they're
[SPEAKER_02]: using pesticides and low quality grow can
live in there a couple times Not my cup of
[SPEAKER_02]: tea your cup of now not at all So I think
it's really weird that Snoop has come and
[SPEAKER_02]: done a deal with the shittiest like
they've got the reputation for being the
[SPEAKER_02]: shittiest dispensary in Colorado Snoop's a
publicist or publishing or public people
[SPEAKER_02]: should have done a lot more research on
this shit This is a big fail on Snoop's
[SPEAKER_02]: Publicists, I think that's what you call
them publicists publicists.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's their fault that guy failed
They should have done a little more work
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm also curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am not a law expert But Snoop is not a
Colorado resident.
[SPEAKER_02]: How was Snoop able to participate in a
Colorado cannabis business?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very curious about that So if you guys
have some insight on that Mike if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: listening Please tweet me or come be on
the show and we will talk about how
[SPEAKER_02]: Snoop's able to do this This is this is
kind of wacky guys Snoop signed up with
[SPEAKER_02]: the shittiest dispenser here in Colorado
And I'm not just talking shit if you're in
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado and you go to live.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well And then go to almost any other
dispensary go to the spot dispensary go to
[SPEAKER_02]: green and healthy wellness when they
reopen here in about two weeks You will
[SPEAKER_02]: see quality products clear to live.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, very quality Yeah, green and healthy
is only a turp station is only medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta be medical Alright, so I wanted
to talk about that for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got past the snoop dog part We did not
even need any help from the news article
[SPEAKER_02]: Snoop big fail, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need some good weed come hit me up
It'll hook you up with a dispensary and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll show you how to grow and I'll show
you how I grow And we'll produce some
[SPEAKER_02]: quality buds for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll make a strain for you called doggie
style We'll do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right So wills a glassblower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk a little bit about blowing
glass, dude You brought some great looking
[SPEAKER_02]: pieces with you appreciate a man The piece
right in front of me is is that called
[SPEAKER_02]: illuminati or is that this is haterade
haterade?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, all right very specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good random question Where did
these names come from the glass net the
[SPEAKER_03]: color of the glass?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, whoever the company that makes it or
the person that pulls it Okay,
[SPEAKER_03]: each one.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like glass alchemy mountain glass
arts and then Taffy tubes D and Elboro
[SPEAKER_03]: here in Denver.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, just bunch of different companies
that pull different colors and they name
[SPEAKER_03]: it whatever they want There's a few that
go across the board like blue stardust is
[SPEAKER_03]: one that every company most likely has
okay But then there's a few I can't think
[SPEAKER_03]: of any off the top of my head But that are
just specifically a company made them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right So is this a common color or is
this here?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pretty common one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right So what's the difference between
haterade slime and illuminati?
[SPEAKER_03]: Illuminati is UV reactive illuminati looks
just like haterade pretty much a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit more on the yellow side probably But
it's UV reactive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you hit it with the UV light to
glows, it's whole it's pretty neat I've
[SPEAKER_02]: got a little pendee from shout out to
ghost cat glass with some UV in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, and then slime Of course is a
little it's slime has that kind of yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not it's not as a Transparent a little
more opaque.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, it's got a little bit of white in it
Sometimes how you stretch it and pull it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so you guys were already
learning we learned the difference
[SPEAKER_02]: Illuminati glass is really cool You guys
it's real hip if you're not if you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: in the goal Glass scene this some of this
episode may go over your head,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you're gonna learn a whole bunch today

California.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's everywhere Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the East Coast has got a glass scene
popping up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's everywhere They're now glass
galleries all over the place.

I don't even will and I hang out We are
[SPEAKER_02]: friends through the Garden of Weed and we
don't really hang out in on our own But we
[SPEAKER_02]: always bump into each other at illusions
glass galleries.

[SPEAKER_02]: Time so we're both huge glass enthusiasts,
which is kind of great.

So it this is this a banger hanger would
[SPEAKER_03]: this officially be this I would call a
banger hanger Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're on that subject about banger
hangers I want to give us another shout
[SPEAKER_03]: out to mongrel glass here because he was
one of the first in my opinion to start
[SPEAKER_03]: using this and he even posted About it a
while ago was when before even bangers
[SPEAKER_03]: were a thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was emails when emails were big Then he
was one of the first people to start going
[SPEAKER_03]: back to the original female joint as
opposed to the male joint that people were
[SPEAKER_03]: using for dabbing Because he noticed the
trend of people using attachments and
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything so he I remember him making a
post about it and everything about you
[SPEAKER_03]: know I'm thinking about making the
transition back to just this blah blah
[SPEAKER_03]: blah and he was one of the first people in
my opinion to really You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was confused when I first saw him going
back to the female joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like what's happening here How do I
put my nail in this bitch now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this is new and when I saw the
bangers The club bangers, we're gonna have
[SPEAKER_02]: to talk about bangers in a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna have to define those right
there What's a banger?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are they talking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: I?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wrote down the word banger just so we
remember to talk about that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this piece we're talking about you guys
I know we've been talking about this piece
[SPEAKER_02]: for a long time It's got a really fat base
and then it's got what do you call this
[SPEAKER_02]: one again cab?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dicro Dicro Dicro cab with an iguana a
molt super colorful iguana on the front
[SPEAKER_02]: seat of life in the back of the seat of
life Statue geometry in the background
[SPEAKER_02]: then when you spin it around in the back
there's like a mid with the flower and two
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves around it and then it seals up and
coming out of the Clear sealed part is
[SPEAKER_02]: three pieces of bamboo.
[SPEAKER_02]: The taller piece is the mouthpiece and
then it's got two Beautifully detailed
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves go just one one beautifully
detailed leaf coming up the side It's
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty fresh looking piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's a really stylish looking
rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's one of my favorites for sure I
can see why yeah, does it hit well with
[SPEAKER_02]: that skinny mouthpiece?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, phenomenally cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I heard you pulling like a champ
Alright, so we got to give shoutouts to
[SPEAKER_02]: mongrel to combo and I forgot this guy
whitey whitey Why do I forget white glass
[SPEAKER_02]: people have called me whitey all the time?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm writing these names down so that we
can give a huge shout out at the end and
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure all these glass blowers get a
bunch of love Alright, so are these three
[SPEAKER_03]: of your favorites in my collection?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, these are probably three of my
favorites in my collection for sure I've
[SPEAKER_03]: got a couple more clients.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a couple more pieces by him I've
got the Wyoming angler, but these are like
[SPEAKER_03]: my daily drivers for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got that one of the anglers Yeah,
you guys check those out on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the teeth make me nervous about
Yeah, you can just bust those off and it
[SPEAKER_02]: scares me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work with more of the functional clear
prototype glass for myself It's more my
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So since we're talking about your glass,
I'm gonna brag about my new rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got this hitman over here It's
actually a hitman Samson collab.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got basic hitman.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's got a basic hitman sidecar
design, but then it's got this sweet What
[SPEAKER_02]: do you call that color greenish turquoise?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a nice nice mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks custom custom pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely a custom sort of things
I've never seen anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's that's the one I've been pulling
on lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really Love that rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to hitman glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Dougie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the clear glass that's made by like
a like a brand that's known like hitman
[SPEAKER_02]: because I have nothing against these rigs
But when you buy one of these the function
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes is questionable definitely I've
seen friends of ours spend thousands of
[SPEAKER_02]: dollars on a rig and if you put Four
milliliters too much water in it You're
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna get in your mouth and if you put
five milliliters too short You get a dry
[SPEAKER_02]: dab and you choke for days and I love that
these production rigs that are made the
[SPEAKER_02]: same all the time I love that I know what
I'm getting when I buy them and if I break
[SPEAKER_02]: it I can read I don't want to break it But
if I do I can replace that fairly easily
[SPEAKER_02]: just go to the hitman store Which is
illusions around here and just go grab one
[SPEAKER_02]: off the shelf exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not out of thousand dollars,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, and if you break this, this is
artwork.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is art as well, but this is this took
much This is a proto artwork.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a only one the only safari special
that's out there It is gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys I'll take a picture of it and
I'll put it on my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just promised that so I have to Do it
which means you guys need to check out my
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm writing down Insta so you guys got to
check out my Instagram at I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are pictures of these rigs on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why am I ringing?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so weird that the MacBook is
ringing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just gonna decline that shit
Alright, so if you're on a podcast pull
[SPEAKER_02]: all your shit on airplane mode.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's my advice to you Where the
shits were why I was talking about rigs,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, dude right on for bringing
thousands of dollars worth of glass That
[SPEAKER_02]: is freaking awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna have to grab a torture in just
a second Let's talk about the banger so
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody I talk about dabbing off the
nail you guys I like the nail because I
[SPEAKER_02]: can hook the titanium nail up to the email
The nails that I use are usually titanium
[SPEAKER_02]: They go onto a male joint that points up
you drop the nail onto there or you put
[SPEAKER_02]: your other dome type nail inside there
Like our buddy was talking about this dude
[SPEAKER_02]: decided to flip back to the female joint
because he saw the trend of accessories
[SPEAKER_02]: and what we're calling bangers coming out
so there's a Guy everyone calls him quave,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I think it's actually pronounced
quave.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm not even sure I go back and
forth on it on how I hear you So quave is
[SPEAKER_02]: more comfortable quave sounds a little
fancier a little weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah So anyway, there's a guy named quave
who made what we call the banger It's got
[SPEAKER_02]: a male joint that goes into your rig
That's got a female joint and then it
[SPEAKER_02]: comes straight up and then it curves out
to there are multiple different angles
[SPEAKER_02]: available you get it at 90 45 Probably
other angles as well, but then it's got
[SPEAKER_02]: just a basic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a small It looks like the
lid to your chapstick But it's clear it's
[SPEAKER_02]: made out of quartz and so You heat that
shit up and then you let it cool and you
[SPEAKER_02]: drop your dab in there and the theory and
I believe it Is that the quartz is giving
[SPEAKER_02]: a much cleaner more flavorful hit from
your dad?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes compared to the titanium and I really
agree with it my problem is I'm a little
[SPEAKER_02]: clumsy and I I'm gonna break that and you
got to keep that a little bit cleaner It's
[SPEAKER_02]: a little more high maintenance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely more high maintenance having
the banger with the tie You know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can get it real dirty and then just
get it hot and hit it with a one of those
[SPEAKER_03]: little Brushes for the grill even almost
as a little steel wool steel wool type
[SPEAKER_03]: things right and get it fresh and clean
But with the banger once it gets dirty,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's uh, it's dirty And if you want to
keep it clean, you got to do the it's got
[SPEAKER_03]: to keep q-tipping it every day for every
use
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they ready for the q-tip tech yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well q-tip tech since we're on so that's a
banger you guys basically a banger is made
[SPEAKER_02]: out of quartz A lot of them are made out
of glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see a problem with dabbing out of
the glass piece But it's not gonna taste
[SPEAKER_02]: as good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not gonna last as long It's gonna
break after heating and cooling so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: The quartz is better quality If you're
gonna use anything quartz are tied
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely one of the two Yeah,
and if you're gonna maybe ceramic the
[SPEAKER_02]: halen honey holes are great if you're
going for something made out of quartz The
[SPEAKER_02]: halen troughs are amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: The quav banger the banger knockoffs are
cool If you trust your artist in your
[SPEAKER_02]: vendor trust where your stuff is coming
from try not to buy china That's where I
[SPEAKER_02]: was heading up.
[SPEAKER_02]: No china glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's made by little kids that aren't using
proper protection Is there a difference in
[SPEAKER_02]: the glass?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's really hard to tell but yeah
There is definitely a difference in
[SPEAKER_03]: there's quartz qualities and the chinese
manufacturers are definitely gonna be
[SPEAKER_03]: using much lower quality quartz as cheap
as they can find as cheap as they can find
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's just some Douche over here
trying to make money Just exploiting the
[SPEAKER_03]: market right and You're definitely gonna
find lower grade Chinese made quartz is
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna be much lower grade than American
made just like titanium exactly You guys I
[SPEAKER_02]: know we sound like a bunch of snobby
douches when we talk about getting a
[SPEAKER_02]: quality nail, but that's your health
You're heating this product up to I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: even know how many degrees hard enough to
burn the shit out of yourself And you're
[SPEAKER_02]: putting your medicine on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're putting your hash on there and
you're smoking directly into your lungs So
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever's in that you're you're gonna dab
it if it's something that puts off some
[SPEAKER_02]: sort Of gas or has an oil on it or some
kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna dab that right along with
your earl.
[SPEAKER_02]: So get a quality nail That's super
important to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so q-tip tech q-tip done dabbing
with your banger You got to heat that
[SPEAKER_02]: bitch up and clean it out with a q-tip,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you don't even heat it in theory is
that if you get the good you get a good
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature where it's not too hot So
you're done dabbing you get your good
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature You got to do it pretty much
immediately after you grab a q-tip you
[SPEAKER_03]: wipe the inside There should be like a
little bit of a not a puddle but some
[SPEAKER_03]: wetness in there you get it quick enough
It'll clean it out Look good as new you're
[SPEAKER_03]: good to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't even got to heat it up Like this
nail for example, I was trying to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the nails a couple weeks old now.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, you know, it's still But on
this one you can see I haven't in the
[SPEAKER_03]: q-tip tech as well and it's like in the
darkness exactly Yeah, that's why it's
[SPEAKER_02]: always in there heating that shit Yeah,
yeah, because if you take it down and you
[SPEAKER_03]: can heat it up right after you dab that'll
work, too But that's not gonna that's also
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna like burn it and heat like it burns
it a little bit so the q-tip tech is
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely like The ideal I guess it's
just yes, it's definitely catching on and
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw you saying something on Facebook
about q-tip tech the q-tip tech I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: have a problem with the q-tip tech.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's these new q-tip holders is what I
find hilarious $300 glass tip holder and
[SPEAKER_03]: there's there's some janky ones you'll see
going for like a hundred and fifty dollars
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's literally It's literally a shot
glass for you people home It's a shot
[SPEAKER_03]: glass that a glassblower made and put some
color on and some of these guys are
[SPEAKER_03]: putting absolutely no time into it you can
tell and They put them up for auctions.
[SPEAKER_03]: They go for like 150 there was One I will
say the one that started the whole hype on
[SPEAKER_03]: it was a a two stroke and sleek collab
That they posted and I think they kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: posted it as a joke Originally and then
they and then they got a ton of hype
[SPEAKER_03]: behind it And so they decided to auction
it off and they went for twenty two
[SPEAKER_03]: hundred dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy shit, and I'm not don't get me wrong
I mean this shit was amazing these two
[SPEAKER_03]: stroke and sleek are phenomenal glass
artists and their work goes I mean their
[SPEAKER_03]: work is expensive But at the end of the
day it was it was a shot glass q-tip
[SPEAKER_03]: holder is what they were selling It's a
thing to hold q-tips.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know saying and Yeah, you can dab
exactly but but this whole q-tip holder
[SPEAKER_03]: thing blew up overnight and it's insane
You can do something with that kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: money.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do a lot of stuff communities.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah $22,000 so twenty two hundred
twenty two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, twenty two thousand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that be insane twenty two hundred
though?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can still change still twenty two
hundred twenty two hundred change your day
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh 200 change a week a lot of people
listening right now that would fix their
[SPEAKER_02]: whole damn car.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah car would not be falling apart If I
had twenty two hundred, I'd be straight
[SPEAKER_02]: right now, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, I'm doing okay, and I'd take
twenty Damn all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how long ago did you make your first
q-tip holder before it got popular?
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly like I didn't make it as a
q-tip holder when I first started uh
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably one of my first after a month
about being on the torch I was working
[SPEAKER_03]: with shaping to make mini tubes and I
started making shot glasses last little
[SPEAKER_03]: nugjar things That was what we what I was
calling them and my shopmate was calling
[SPEAKER_03]: me again nug jars, you know Yeah,
which is what they are And then I took it
[SPEAKER_03]: home and I was like, oh look I could put
q-tips in these.

a while when the elbow I mean I was on the
[SPEAKER_03]: elbow bubble for a while but then
everybody was everybody was a huge and it

definitely deflated a little bit Salt of
[SPEAKER_03]: course.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was one of my favorites back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys check out salt.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy dirty shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and then One of the with the books
my gosh, I cannot remember the name of him
[SPEAKER_03]: right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm tripping slipping these two books.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're uh Yeah, it's really before glass
was a thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're these smoked smoked out smoked
volume one and two Okay, they're books
[SPEAKER_03]: full of glass artists and everything and
it was before there was really a glass
[SPEAKER_03]: scene type of thing It was just kind of
like this was how you found there was no
[SPEAKER_03]: Instagram This was like these were the
heady artists at the time and anybody in
[SPEAKER_03]: that book, too I can't really remember
anyone specific because it was a while
[SPEAKER_03]: ago, but that but those books definitely
were like Whoa, this is kind of sparked
[SPEAKER_03]: you a little bit stuck in your mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, all right and Degenerate art the
documentary that was the biggest I think I
[SPEAKER_03]: watched that my freshman year in college
and I was already into glass That's what
[SPEAKER_03]: we watched it, but we were more into me my
roommate had a bunch of roars We had like
[SPEAKER_03]: roars and 5150 AMG just much straight
tube.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay rippers Yeah, exactly what it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and then we were like, oh dude,
there's a movie about glass on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's watch it and That movie honestly,
I would say like anybody like changed my
[SPEAKER_03]: life it opened me up to my Eyes to the
scene of glass that I had no idea even
[SPEAKER_03]: existed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, holy hell.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is crazy Like this is nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you get to meet Bob Snodgrass at
champs?
[SPEAKER_03]: I did meet Bob Snodgrass.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was really cool for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna shut up Bob Snodgrass man.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the man.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the the og Yeah, your godfather of
modern-day glass blowing for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You kind of did it on accident Oh,
yeah, if you know how he did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely check out degenerate art
if you have any any interest in glass or
[SPEAKER_02]: art or just culture in general any It's
just a really it's just a great great film
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're into cannabis culture and yeah
looking for something that you want to
[SPEAKER_02]: watch That's not just we like if your
girlfriend's coming over and you want to
[SPEAKER_02]: watch something else That's a good one to
watch.
[SPEAKER_02]: She might be entertained by that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just another weed movie It's
awesome and it's really cool with that one
[SPEAKER_03]: because that was only four years ago that
that documentary was like produced and
[SPEAKER_03]: made and Let out and it's just crazy to
see how far the glass industry in the
[SPEAKER_03]: market has come from 2011 to 2015 where in
2011, you know kind of this underground
[SPEAKER_03]: scene That like right there was nothing on
it really until this documentary came out
[SPEAKER_03]: and then you know, like at the time in the
documentary I believe Scott Deppie his
[SPEAKER_03]: most expensive piece at the time was
$18,000 like that's that's a crazy amount
[SPEAKER_03]: of money obviously for a piece But now
Scott Deppie is selling pieces for I mean
[SPEAKER_03]: 18 to 23 thousand is I mean, that's
nothing every day That's every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he's got the hundred thousand dollar
pieces going out So so what I wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: ask you what makes the market do that kind
of shit What makes an artist and the
[SPEAKER_02]: market jump up and down and then like we
said earlier elbow the guy that makes The
[SPEAKER_02]: dyno rigs he shot up huge for a little
while and then one day everyone's just
[SPEAKER_02]: selling their elbows on Instagram for
stupid cheap What makes shit go like that
[SPEAKER_02]: in the glass market?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I definitely think what happened
with Instagram definitely helps.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean Instagram is a huge part of like
Who's doing you know, what's who's what in
[SPEAKER_03]: the glass world?
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess If they've got, you know,
lots of followers on there people are
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna think they're like oil brothers,
for example, Matt Bowlin He's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: But his first rig that he put up for sale
it was a little coil potted green mini rig
[SPEAKER_03]: and it sold for like $800 at auction and
it was like his first rig that he ever
[SPEAKER_03]: sold just cuz yeah, it was a hype thing
but um, I guess with the market what
[SPEAKER_03]: happened was like everybody all of a
sudden started getting into it and it
[SPEAKER_03]: built really fast like it went from
nothing to something like in a year
[SPEAKER_03]: mothership prices were quadrupling just
because I Really don't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just be kind of like it people started
finding out about it I guess it wasn't all
[SPEAKER_03]: of a sudden an underground thing that was
like, you know people had Instagrams they
[SPEAKER_03]: get to show their stuff So people were
buying more stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and then everyone when the market
peaked everyone was like, oh man Like kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of like a stock market almost it's like a
stock market crash if you want to think
[SPEAKER_03]: about it like that Where you know,
everyone's like, oh god sell sell sell buy
[SPEAKER_03]: buy buy, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah And you know when mothership is like
now's the time to sell the motherships and
[SPEAKER_03]: so everybody sells their ships or I guess
elbow in this example Everybody had the
[SPEAKER_03]: brontos and they were like buying them for
I bought mine for $2,000 for example I
[SPEAKER_03]: bought it from illusions $2,000 brand-new
sold it about six months later for $1,700
[SPEAKER_03]: and I struggled selling it for that,
you know saying yeah, and it was usually
[SPEAKER_03]: like before that had no problem I
definitely bought mine at the peak of the
[SPEAKER_03]: the peak of the hype Yeah, it was like
right when I came down for vacation for
[SPEAKER_03]: the first time before I moved a little rig
Yeah, it was sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely love that thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but uh, but I think definitely
people they see what the rigs are going
[SPEAKER_03]: for Retail wise and so they're like,
okay, that's retail I'm gonna put a hype
[SPEAKER_03]: price on it and it goes for a little bit
more and then eventually it's gonna build
[SPEAKER_03]: up to a point And then people are gonna be
like fuck that I'm not paying that
[SPEAKER_03]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the price will start going down And
then all of a sudden everybody starts to
[SPEAKER_03]: sell their rigs trying to oh shit I got
rid of this now while they're still still
[SPEAKER_03]: worth something and then that in itself
Decreasing depreciates the value a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so it's a little interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny to see the mothership hype I
saw the motherships go roller coaster one
[SPEAKER_02]: rig the same rig went from 12 to 18 to 24
to 28 to 32 and now they're about 18 dude
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a time when you could get I mean
clear clear ships were going for like 9k
[SPEAKER_03]: at one point 5k some shit I was like,
holy hell are you kidding?
[SPEAKER_02]: There are new ships one just sold for
$35,000 for the new trifecta It's uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: so mothership is known for the Klein the
Taurus and the fab egg and they combined
[SPEAKER_02]: all three into one rig Sandblasted it and
put some crazy Logos on it sold it for
[SPEAKER_02]: $35,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shut up the Scott Debbie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's doing all right over he's doing
big shout out to the mothership You want
[SPEAKER_02]: to see some crazy glass you guys?

[SPEAKER_02]: glass?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the great one revere glass on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry on YouTube.

gonna start into they have like like 50
[SPEAKER_03]: something videos and each one's a little
how-to video To do a different little,

[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually guys that do it heard of the

[SPEAKER_03]: they did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they have a couple different little
things they do on there It's pretty cool
[SPEAKER_02]: big shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to those guys for teaching people
all the shit that they know because that
[SPEAKER_02]: is a huge art Oh, yeah, I want to give a
big shout out to somebody who will never
[SPEAKER_02]: hear this but my buddy Ian I'm not even
gonna say his real name, but he's Ian.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a good guy He's not on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not even like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's kind of he doesn't want no to write
He just wants to make glass and be a glass
[SPEAKER_02]: artist But uh that dude tried to teach me
how to blow glass and it wasn't his fault
[SPEAKER_02]: that I couldn't learn It was totally my
fault there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good at several things and blowing
glass is definitely not one of them I got
[SPEAKER_02]: a fiber optic burn.
[SPEAKER_02]: I burned my foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how I burned my foot I don't
know what burned me that'll happen burn my
[SPEAKER_02]: damn foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am NOT meant to blow Shout out to all
the people that can and shout out to Ian
[SPEAKER_02]: for trying to teach me and shout out to
the raging glass Crew that tried to
[SPEAKER_02]: tolerate my dumbass in their studio for a
couple of nights It only took me like two
[SPEAKER_02]: attempts to realize this is not for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny Yeah, it's hot you guys if
you want to blow glass you better be
[SPEAKER_02]: prepared for some heat Yeah, yeah,
and you got to get in that fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to just get in there You got to
get just there's no you can't hesitate no
[SPEAKER_03]: stopping You just got to keep going and
keep that shit spinning and your fingers
[SPEAKER_03]: get sweaty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep it hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's not so much respect I
understand why glass is so expensive to an
[SPEAKER_02]: extent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah to an extent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Raw glass in itself is expensive too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a big thing that people a lot of
think I think a lot of people don't think
[SPEAKER_03]: about is sometimes you can get like a rod
of slime like a Just a couple ounces of
[SPEAKER_03]: slime.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a single little color rod can cost
like 15 bucks for just a little rod.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit Yeah, yeah, and then how many I
know they break in the kiln sometimes when
[SPEAKER_02]: you make a rig So how many what percentage
of your work will break in the kiln,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know on a good day like I'll get like
20% breakage, but on an average day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like 50% It'll just be like not
necessarily in the kiln, but it'll like
[SPEAKER_03]: it'll break one While I'm making it or
it'll some a piece of it'll break I'll
[SPEAKER_03]: have to make a new piece like my base will
break because Acute angles will kill you
[SPEAKER_03]: if you have an acute angle on glass when
it when it cools down it cracks If the
[SPEAKER_03]: seal is not perfect, there's air pockets
There's just so many little little things
[SPEAKER_03]: that go into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right cools down quicker than one
piece if it's too thick It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those little details are the things that
the china glass are not pay attention to
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes seals.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're seals.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were proper anneal cycles They don't
use proper seal so you could you know some
[SPEAKER_03]: of their seals you could just push it with
your Thumb and it'll fall off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I want to do that I buy American
