Bog on the GoFundMe.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last episode, I mentioned that we
did lose a cannabis soldier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rest in peace, Bog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did ask for support for Mrs. Bog through
the GoFundMe page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thank you to everybody who contributed
to that GoFundMe page.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of response to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a lot of great messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a lot of encouragement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most importantly, we got Mrs. Bog a lot of
help and a lot of funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does mean a lot to see the outpouring
of support from the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mrs. Bog truly does appreciate the
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into the main topic of
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a nice, cold Colorado evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the monitor said it was 17 degrees
outside when I looked at the security
[SPEAKER_00]: cameras.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is frosty cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do update a thing I said on a
previous episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a previous episode, I mentioned getting
your plants up off of the grow room floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That grow room floor is super cold in the
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be super cold in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure where you are or what you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: My grow room floor is really cold in the
winter time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always a good idea to get my
plants up off of the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people will use a pallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people use a cinder block.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people use another pot flipped upside
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as we are getting those pods up
off the ground so the root zone isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: super cold, we are giving our plants a
little bit of help or setting ourselves up
[SPEAKER_00]: for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about that cold pot sitting on the
floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice and cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we pour water into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That water makes it even colder.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant can't go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get pissed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get those plants up off the floor
and keep them nice and warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that I was inspired by that
episode was to tell you to put your easy
[SPEAKER_00]: cloner or your turbo cloner on that cold
floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you an idea of what I'm
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not following along,
a lot of us use a turbo cloner or an easy
[SPEAKER_00]: cloner or a power cloner to make our
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a clone machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You fill a reservoir with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put a pump inside of that reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: That reservoir has a manifold with
multiple sprayers that spray water at an
[SPEAKER_00]: upward angle toward the bottom of our
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a lid on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You fill the lid with clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottoms of the clones hang down into
that spraying area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get misted with that water and they
make roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pump inside of that cloner will heat
up the water quite rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a normal environment, I would run that
pump for about 50 minutes and then turn it
[SPEAKER_00]: off for 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every hour it gets a 10 minute rest
cycle to let the heat of that water cool
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water is getting heated by the pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water is naturally warm because it's
in that warm grow area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to heat up quite quickly
inside that little reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: A way we can avoid that in the winter is
to simply take that clone machine and put
[SPEAKER_00]: it on our cold grow room floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will keep that water nice and cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will mitigate some of the heat
created by that pump and that will keep
[SPEAKER_00]: your clones nice and happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, this will also prevent in a
little bit of the evaporation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't have to adjust your pH and your
EC as frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure to check the EC and the pH of
your cloner on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you add clear res every five
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the water is a little cooler,
it won't evaporate as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we won't need to make as many critical
adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something to pay attention to is don't let
it get too cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think 69 degrees and above is good for
our water and our turbo cloner and for our
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, you may want to go a little
higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to go a little cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my rule of thumb is 69 degrees is as
cool as I want to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to go much cooler than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will start slowing down the root
development and the health of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first tip for the winter is if you
are using an easy cloner or a clone
[SPEAKER_00]: machine and the water is heating up too
rapidly, take that clone machine and set
[SPEAKER_00]: it right on the cold grow room floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That cold is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right there waiting for you and it is
there to solve a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this episode is going to be about using
the things in our grow room that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: already got to create the best environment
and best conditions we can with what we've
[SPEAKER_00]: got.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've spent a lot of money on equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've spent a lot of time planning this
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try to learn to adapt to each season
and use the gear wisely to get the best
[SPEAKER_00]: outcomes in our grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another big tip I've got for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water coming out of the faucet in the
winter is going to be cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pipes are outside underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cold as fuck out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That water is going to come out of the
faucet really cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be in the 40s.
[SPEAKER_00]: and 50s maybe in the 60s depending on how
cold it is in your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I'm saying is Fahrenheit by the
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go by Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Canada or somewhere else you
can adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to do the math.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm speaking in Fahrenheit terms today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me make that clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the water coming out of the faucet in
the winter is going to be 60 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said before we don't want to feed the
plants anything that's 69 degrees or
[SPEAKER_00]: cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not fill your reservoir up today
before you've got to water in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drag the reservoir into the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it underneath the grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to go right under the
lights where the plants are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got some extra space in your
grow environment for your reservoir,
[SPEAKER_00]: roll that reservoir right into the grow
room and let it get heated up by the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way when we go in there to water
you've got water that is the same
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature as the room in which the
plants are in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we're not giving them any shock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not giving them any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not dipping their feet in that cold water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be nice to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You expect a positive outcome from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not torture them by pouring icy cold
water over their feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so fill up that reservoir the
night before, the day before if possible,
[SPEAKER_00]: and let it get warmed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't get it warm enough by the
time you need to use it, I recommend an
[SPEAKER_00]: aquarium heater.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get those glass aquarium heaters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drop it right in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plug it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself a timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your, most of the good, the Blue Lab
EC and pH meters have a thermometer on
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just drop that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it float around.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're walking around the grow doing
your chores, just check on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a little stir.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what the pH of that, or the
temperature of that water is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when it's heated up appropriately,
unplug the heater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean the heater off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gather a lot of sediment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Save it for next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always adjust the pH after the water is at
room temperature right before you feed it
[SPEAKER_00]: to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's cold, the water will get warm and
the pH will change.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's hot, it will cool down and the pH
will change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adjust the pH when it is at the
temperature at which you are going to feed
[SPEAKER_00]: it to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be that pH when it goes into your
plants at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't adjust it when it's cold because it
will fluctuate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't adjust it when it's hot because it
will fluctuate.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it adjusts to room temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So adjust your pH at room temperature,
then feed it to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here are a couple of other useful tips
and tricks to do with ducting and venting
[SPEAKER_00]: in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is nice and cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps you've got two grow spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps you've got a flowering space that
runs for 12 hours on and 12 hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've probably got a veg space that
runs for 16 on, eight off, or 18 on and
[SPEAKER_00]: six off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe 24 on if you're one of those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a 19 and five because that makes my
mother plants grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure that the big mother plants
won't try to auto flower on me if they're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting root bound or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does give them four hours to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend at least a four hour sleep
period or it gives them five hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: My math was terrible there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend some sleep period for your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lets your plants sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lets the root zone and the microbes
happen in the dark zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that activity happens in the
nighttime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let them sleep, get some nighttime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it gives your equipment some rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those lights have been running all
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of your fans, your blowers,
everything has been running.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can turn a few things off for a
four hour period, you're saving
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're saving time on your equipment,
which will give you longevity out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, everything wants a nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I ran you for 24 hours a day and never
gave you any dark time, you may show some
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of signs of psycho eventually,
some psychosis, some craziness will come
[SPEAKER_00]: out of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything wants a nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give those plants a little nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give your gear a nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Utilize the nap time of your gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm getting at is when the flower
room goes off in the winter time,
[SPEAKER_00]: it may get a bit cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: When those lights shut off, the
temperatures will drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I do is I duct the heat from my
veg room into the flower room at nighttime
[SPEAKER_00]: so I can keep that flower room a little
bit warmer than it would be without heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I don't have to buy a heater to
put in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using the heat that's already being
created in one room by the lights that are
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly on, and I'm just dumping that
heat right into another room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So learn to utilize the heat that you
don't want in one area, put it in another
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you can keep one room cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: One room will be at the right temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to buy a heater to keep
that flowering room cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else I do, sometimes if it's the
right temperature, if it works out just
[SPEAKER_00]: right, I will duct the heat from the
flowering room into a portion of my home
[SPEAKER_00]: and spread that out throughout the house
to keep the entire house warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a smaller house,
this will work beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple or a few thousand watt lights
will heat up a room quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a 10 by 10 room with 4,000
watt lights, you're cranking out a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of ducting that stuff right
outside of the house, duct that into your
[SPEAKER_00]: bedroom, duct that into your living room,
duct it into the basement and let it rise
[SPEAKER_00]: into the rest of the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heat rises, think about moving that warm
air around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can save yourself on HVAC costs,
heating, ventilation, air conditioning
[SPEAKER_00]: costs can go down if you learn how to duct
the air that you're already creating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Duct that warm air to a useful spot of the
house, to the grow, wherever you need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn to move that air around and utilize
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we don't have to spend more money
on heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's already heat, let's use it,
let's get warm with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can duct that heat straight from
either your flower room or your bedroom
[SPEAKER_00]: right into your house, right into your
bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a bedroom that gets kind of
cold at night, if your basement doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: get warm enough, if part of the house
doesn't get warm enough, run that ducting
[SPEAKER_00]: right to there and just duct that heat
into the coldest part of the house,
[SPEAKER_00]: warm yourself up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like recycling, you're saving
money and it's grow room heat that needs
[SPEAKER_00]: to go somewhere anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send it somewhere useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else can we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is humidity to be dealt with.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times the flower room will make a
lot of heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got big flowering plants in there,
you've got a bunch of humidity going on,
[SPEAKER_00]: you just fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got four lights in there,
you've got four seven gallon pots per
[SPEAKER_00]: light, that's going to be a lot of
humidity when you water those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got more in there,
maybe you've got less.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to create humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: My point is, let's learn to duct that
humidity from the flowering room into the
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The veg room loves high humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not gonna run into nearly as many
problems with a veg room with high
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity as you would a flowering room
with high humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's put a blower at the top of the
room or a duct at the top of the room
[SPEAKER_00]: that'll suck all that humidity because the
humidity is at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's suck that heat and humidity out of
that room and move it right into the veg
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you need is a four inch blower and
some ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to use a humidistat that will
tell you how much humidity is in the room,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can set a humidistat to say when it
gets to 70 or 80% humidity, I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: guessing random numbers, it's got a dial
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it hits that setting, it'll kick on
and it will move your humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it gets past that threshold,
it'll turn it right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a switch that plugs into the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You turn a dial, you set it to the amount
you want, then you plug your blower into
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a sensor that hangs in the middle
of the room and it says, oh, 80% humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: I better turn on this blower and it'll
blow that duct.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll blow that air right through the
duct, right into your veg room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now your veg room gets a little extra
humidity and you don't cause problems in
[SPEAKER_00]: the flowering area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about utilizing what is already
there with minimal equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will save you problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will save you money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably bought a bunch of excess gear
that you didn't need anyway because people
[SPEAKER_00]: get excited when they build their grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's learn to use that to our advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a lot of people, this is kind of old
school tech, but a lot of people are still
[SPEAKER_00]: doing the old school tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have ducted lights,
vented lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a light, I'm gonna try to
explain this the best I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a light fixture that hangs from
the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a square fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom part has glass under it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a bulb inside of there,
but instead of sealing that bottom,
[SPEAKER_00]: we put glass in there so the light can
shine through the glass and illuminate the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put a hole on one side of the box and
a hole on the other side of the box and we
[SPEAKER_00]: can run ducting across that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we can move the heat away from
the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't enter our grow space and we can
duct that light, that heat wherever we
[SPEAKER_00]: need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times you'll put several of those
lights in a chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put a blower at one end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You blow a carbon filter, a blower,
ducting and then your light chain,
[SPEAKER_00]: however many lights you're gonna put.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you do ducting right outside of
your grow facility, right out of the room,
[SPEAKER_00]: right out of the window.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you're gonna do it, duct that air
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then the air goes over your lights and
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you're cooling off the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of that light heat is heating up your
grow space, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not turn that blower around and suck
that cool air over your lights to cool the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights even more?
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, I would do a complete loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have air coming in from outside,
going over my lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it would do a U-turn at one end of
the room and go right back across the
[SPEAKER_00]: room, go through all the other ducting
over every light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it would go out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would go right against the wall and
that duct would go right out of a hole I
[SPEAKER_00]: use the blue foam insulation to cover
windows and you can drill six inch holes
[SPEAKER_00]: through that foam insulation very easily
and run your ducting right through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would create a continuous loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way none of that heat from your
lights makes it to your grow and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: cool those lights rapidly by pulling that
17 degree air over those light bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll cool it very, very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't introduce that 17 degree air into
your grow room right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you'll start getting frost and
icicles and that will encourage you to get
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can reverse the duct and keep
that loop and get the air over the lights
[SPEAKER_00]: and right back out, that will rapidly cool
those grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times it's going to get too cold
in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's to stop you from hanging more
lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time the thing stopping us
from putting up more lights is heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's winter time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put up more lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't buy a heater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put a heater in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: More light is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light will create the heat for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put more lights in there and warm up that
grow room with more lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, if you want to do a heater,
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need a heater in the night cycle
if you don't have a way to keep it warm,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you don't have another room to dump the
heat into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But instead of buying a heater,
I almost always buy another grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else to think about is our light
schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we running the lights at the
appropriate time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Electricity is overall cheaper at
nighttime.
[SPEAKER_00]: During off peak hours, your electricity is
cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's working, everybody's hustling
and bustling, everyone's at the store,
[SPEAKER_00]: at the office doing stuff from like eight
to six in the day, eight in the morning to
[SPEAKER_00]: six in the evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's busy doing shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Electricity is much more expensive then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think around eight or nine o'clock,
your electricity price will drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will reduce a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's run more of our electrical
components during that off peak hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's a little bit cheaper to run all
of your equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's colder then.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the sun goes down and gets cold
outside, let's turn on the lights while
[SPEAKER_00]: it's cold outside to keep that grow room
cold during the coldest part of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when the lights go off during the
day, it's not super cold outside because
[SPEAKER_00]: we got the sun helping us out a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use that cheaper lighting,
the cheaper electricity and the sun
[SPEAKER_00]: competition and the lights' heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use it all together to create a cheaper,
more efficient grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times we'll do that in the summer
because it's too damn hot during the day
[SPEAKER_00]: to run the grow lights because you're
competing with the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your air conditioner is trying to cool
that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got lights and the sun to fight with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get real hot in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run your lights during the nighttime
during the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also run them during the nighttime during
the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it gets so cold in the dark time
and the nighttime that you want those
[SPEAKER_00]: lights to heat up your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that made sense because I jumbled
my words trying to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that is helpful, these colder
temperatures are going to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful colors for our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do get that grow room a little bit
colder in your night cycle, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: toward the very end of flower,
that flush phase, if you can get it a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit cold in there, that is going to
turn your plants, the leaves will get
[SPEAKER_00]: purple, they'll turn red, they'll get
yellow fall colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really find beauty in those fall winter
colors when the plants are finishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That always comes from my winter crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my best photos are my winter
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say that their crop around
Halloween is always the best indoor crop
[SPEAKER_00]: that they pull.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so easy because we're not competing
with all the heat from the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not getting as much humidity because
it's not as hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is prime opportunity for a beautiful
winter crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where am I going to go from here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to quickly skim my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure I didn't skip anything because
I'm on a roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I want to talk about,
this is not seasonal related.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a trick that I learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I learned this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give credit where credit is
due.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the very first time I ever saw
this was my friend Colin Gordon from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethos Collective is who showed me this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are getting big giant chunky buds
in your grow room, and this works for any
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, wintertime, summertime,
this is for big chunky buds in a humid
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're getting big fat colas,
big fat buds in your grow room,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get the opportunity for powdery mildew
or bud mold, more likely bud mold is what
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have said, in the middle of those
big buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a big fucking gallon milk jug size
bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a bunch of miniature buds
growing up a stick and they're all kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: gathering up the middle of that stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take, I could take, I would recommend
you take popsicle sticks or tongue
[SPEAKER_00]: depressors and kind of peel that bud off
of the stick a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't break it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pull it back from the stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grab one little bud on a giant
cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pull those buds off and put a
popsicle stick in there or a tongue
[SPEAKER_00]: depressor in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let the bud rest up against the stem
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're going to create air space
between the bud and the stem and the other
[SPEAKER_00]: buds on that stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you will drastically reduce your
opportunity to get bud mold in the middle
[SPEAKER_00]: of that gigantic bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to explain that one more
time just to make sure I get it clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a big cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really one big bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is multiple buds growing really well
together on one big stock is what you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you got that big cola, it looks like
a big glory bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it gets to the grow, once it gets to
the dispensary environment, it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get cut down into little buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a bunch of little buds on one
stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got your big stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a bunch of little medium sized
buds growing off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a stick with the chunky
nugget growing off and a chunky nugget
[SPEAKER_00]: growing off and a nugget.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just pull that nugget out and down
a little bit and slide a popsicle stick in
[SPEAKER_00]: there or a tongue depressor in there and
let it close on there and hold the stick
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you will create air space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're just creating, we're putting a
little gap between the other buds and the
[SPEAKER_00]: stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can create some airflow in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about all the moisture that is
trapped in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about all the microbial activity
that could develop inside of that tight
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your buds are kind of spongy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hold a lot of moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's open them up, make sure we got a
fan in there and that popsicle stick
[SPEAKER_00]: tongue depressor trick may prevent some of
the moldy buds that I've seen happening in
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are striving for those giant buds
and you're getting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at harvest time we realize,
shit, this is all moldy in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you that I chopped down a white
rhino plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was probably 10 years ago and Mike
will testify to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I chopped down a white rhino plant that
had a top cola the size of two,
[SPEAKER_00]: two liter soda bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bud was probably 30 inches tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even reach as tall as it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the entire plant was just this one
cola and it was as big around as a two
[SPEAKER_00]: liter soda bottle all the way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was huge and girthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were completely excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took so many pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've never grown anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never done anything like that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because once we harvested it, we started
cutting it apart and the entire middle of
[SPEAKER_00]: that whole plant was moldy right up the
middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of that product went into a big ass
trash can and it went out to the trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was considered waste at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I could have prevented that was
obviously a little bit more airflow,
[SPEAKER_00]: but how am I going to get air moving
inside of that big giant donkey dick of a
[SPEAKER_00]: bud?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to open up those buds a little bit,
put some tongue depressors or popsicle
[SPEAKER_00]: sticks in there or something non-porous
that isn't going to hold moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use something plastic if you've
got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tongue depressors and popsicle sticks are
readily available.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can break them in half.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get two uses out of one popsicle
stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just spread them around your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will really help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds random and chaotic to a
lot of people, but if you've got a big
[SPEAKER_00]: grow that's at risk of losing product to a
bud rot, especially outdoors and in a big
[SPEAKER_00]: grow in a humid, humid area, this will be
very useful to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to skim one more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure I got all my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I covered everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to go too quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water is cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exhaust your heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Move the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't feed the plants too cold of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run the lights during the night or day,
depending on your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add more lights to keep it warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lower temperatures are going to get your
plants colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Popsicle sticks for giant buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think I covered all of my notes.
