[SPEAKER_06]: Culture podcast, now known as the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for listening, everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm your host, Justin Jeff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for joining me for another episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, I've been smoking live resin today,
and I'm a little bit dabbed out,
[SPEAKER_06]: a little more dabbed out than usual.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were smoking some stuff called Bear
Naked.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't know about the Bear Naked yet,
but when you hear about it, you'll
[SPEAKER_06]: remember that you heard about it on the I
Grow Culture podcast first.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to give a big shout out to Spence
and the whole Garden of Wheat and Crew.
[SPEAKER_06]: They let me hang out for a couple hours
tonight on the couch, take some dabs,
[SPEAKER_06]: talk a little bit, be social.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for the dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for the live resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for the Bear Naked.
[SPEAKER_06]: Much respect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Appreciate it, guys.

[SPEAKER_06]: Now, the song ended and it got real quiet.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was awkward.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like when you're at a concert and
you're yelling and then all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_06]: the song stops and all they can hear is
you yelling.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're always saying a really stupid word
at that time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I had nachos in my butt or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Oilslick, shout out to those guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Send them a tweet and tell them you're
listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big shout out to our friends at
treethugger.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: This episode is brought to you in part by
treethugger.com, live music lifestyle
[SPEAKER_06]: magazine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check out treethugger.com for concert and
festival news and reviews.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, this show is brought to you
largely by Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies has two
locations to serve Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: Visit the Denver store at 6271 Beach
Street, unit F, or stop by the new Pueblo
[SPEAKER_06]: location on 618 East 4th Street in Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check out Hygro for competitive pricing
and a great selection of indoor grow
[SPEAKER_06]: supplies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't forget to check out www.hygrodenver
.com for current store hours and current
[SPEAKER_06]: store specials.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I've got an extra added bonus
for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hygro has an awesome sale on roots organic
soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get one tote of soil for $550
in-store pickup or $600 delivered.
[SPEAKER_06]: This deal is available at both locations,
the Pueblo and Denver store.
[SPEAKER_06]: Please contact Hygro to verify.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure how far those guys are
willing to drive to haul you that tote of
[SPEAKER_06]: soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm sure a lot of guys are saying,
how much is a tote of soil, Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_06]: The answer is a tote of soil is 54 cubic
feet, which is about 350 gallons.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all in one bag also.
[SPEAKER_06]: So instead of buying a whole bunch of
separate bags, you got one big bag here,
[SPEAKER_06]: a little more eco-friendly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're running three gallon pots,
that's 116 three gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you run five gallon pots, that's 75
gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you run seven gallon pots, like I like
to do, that's 57 gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's not a bad deal at all there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So go get your dirt at Hygro Indoor
Growing Supplies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me read the address to you one more
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is 6271 Beach Street Unit F or the
Pueblo location.
[SPEAKER_06]: That address is in Denver.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Pueblo location is 618 East 4th Street
in Pueblo on the east side.
[SPEAKER_06]: So go check out Hygro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Much respect to all those sponsors.
[SPEAKER_06]: They make the show possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big shout out to you guys for listening.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've made it 21 episodes, you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a couple of things I wrote down I
wanted to talk about.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where did I put the paper?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, big shout out to Natural Mystic
Cannabis Caregivers in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was running low on shatter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Natural Mystic Cannabis Caregivers came to
the rescue.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got some delicious.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm reaching for the container right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm also recording this podcast in video.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I will do anything with
the video, but I am actually recording it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is Guava Sky.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just showing the container from
Natural Mystic Cannabis Caregivers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is Mystic is what it's called.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Mystic has Tora Bora in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a high CBD mix.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the Guava Sky is the Sativa that they
had available.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got more of the Sativa than I did the
CBD mix.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just my preference.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'll show you the Guava Sky for the
guys with the camera.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also take a picture with the, that are
seeing the video.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take a picture and post this up
online, but I'm not watching the video.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know how clear that is.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to stay still for a second so it
can focus.
[SPEAKER_06]: So huge shout out to Natural Mystic
Cannabis Caregivers in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up, Joey?
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up, Shelly?
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you guys listen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a great shop.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you do need medical marijuana,
it does require a red card to get in
[SPEAKER_06]: there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you do need your medical marijuana,
that's the place in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would send you right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have your back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shelly's a cancer survivor.
[SPEAKER_06]: So she knows what you're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're sick, she definitely knows how
to help you out.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's compassionate.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's friendly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Joey's hard to find.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's the boss.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he's always busy working, but Joey's a
great dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's super friendly.
[SPEAKER_06]: He'll shake your hand and spend a minute
with you if he is in the shop.
[SPEAKER_06]: So shout out to those guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got much love for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's a little personal note.
[SPEAKER_06]: Today is, as I'm recording, it's 420 in
the morning on July 23rd.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is officially the birthday of His
Imperial Majesty, King Haile Selassie I
[SPEAKER_06]: the First.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you know what that is, who that is,
you understand why I'm giving thanks and
[SPEAKER_06]: praise.
[SPEAKER_06]: Many thanks and praise.
[SPEAKER_06]: Many birthday blessings to King Haile
Selassie I the First.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to take a little half a second
of silence because it's a podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: A moment of silence would be ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here's a half a second of silence for
King Selassie I the First.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got to keep the show moving.
[SPEAKER_06]: Much respect.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am sad to inform you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to turn the music way down for
this one also.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sad to inform you.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had an event scheduled for July 27th at
the Brickyard.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been talking about it quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're trying to get that hookah bar turned
into a dab bar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, it's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: The event is canceled, and that place is
not going to get to be turned into a
[SPEAKER_06]: smoking establishment.
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize for advertising an event that
didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: The city is against us every step of the
way.
[SPEAKER_06]: They do not want us to get this place
open.
[SPEAKER_06]: They do not want us to have our event.
[SPEAKER_06]: I planned on taking live plants to the
event so that we could do a little bit of
[SPEAKER_06]: education, and I could show a male plant,
a female plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had plants in different stages of flower
for this event.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we can't take plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: They said they would confiscate the
plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't risk taking plants and getting
them taken.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just can't do that to myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's medicine for my patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a caregiver, and they're going to need
that medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can't do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So unfortunately, the event that I had
planned, that I had talked about for July
[SPEAKER_06]: 27th at the Brickyard is canceled.
[SPEAKER_06]: We couldn't come to an agreement with the
city.
[SPEAKER_06]: They do not want us to do the event.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want anybody to get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want my plants to get taken.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have backed out of the event.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other day, I said something on the
show.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember if I said it on the show
or just in a conversation with people,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I need to correct something that I
said.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go to a website here.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is actually from Ed Rosenthal's.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've just got it on my computer.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's easier to do while we're doing a
show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ed Rosenthal's Marijuana Grower's
Handbook.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to show it to the camera.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not watching the video.
[SPEAKER_06]: I should put the video up on the screen so
I can see the video feed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the book that I'm coming from.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I said something about Red Spectrum,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I may have gotten it backwards for
what I told you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is from the book I just showed
you.
[SPEAKER_06]: All credit for what I'm saying right now
goes to Ed Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ed, don't get mad at me for saying this on
the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd want people to know this.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called the Critical Light Period.
[SPEAKER_06]: And let me give you a quick explanation of
what the Critical Light Period is,
[SPEAKER_06]: in my opinion, and a little quick,
because you need to know that to get to
[SPEAKER_06]: where we are.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Critical Light Period is the amount of
dark time a specific cannabis strain will
[SPEAKER_06]: take to flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me elaborate with Ed's article
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gotta take a big breath because I've been
taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now,
[SPEAKER_06]: what I was talking about with somebody was
they were saying that their plants are
[SPEAKER_06]: starting to flower and it's not 12 hours
of darkness outside.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's because of the sunset and the
sunrise have specific color spectrums that
[SPEAKER_06]: are triggering hormones in your plants,
is what I was telling them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was calling all of this info from
memory.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think I got it backwards to tell you
the truth.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I said that on a podcast or if I
said that to you in person, I need to
[SPEAKER_06]: correct that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's what Ed Rosenthal has written a
little bit more about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: If marijuana plants grown outdoors
required a 12-hour dark period to flower,
[SPEAKER_06]: they would not be induced to start
flowering until September 21st,
[SPEAKER_06]: the first day of autumn, when day and
night are equal length.
[SPEAKER_06]: They would ripen six to eight weeks later.
[SPEAKER_06]: In real life, most modern varieties ripen
between early September and late October.
[SPEAKER_06]: Budding was triggered six to eight weeks
earlier.
[SPEAKER_06]: For instance, an eight-week variety that
requires 55 days from forcing to maturity,
[SPEAKER_06]: which would normally ripen October 1st,
would start flowering August 1st.
[SPEAKER_06]: At that day in San Francisco, sunrise
occurs at 514 and sunset at 918,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is 718, a total of 14 hours and four
minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dawn and dusk at another 15 minutes of red
light.
[SPEAKER_06]: Plants use the absence of this spectrum to
measure the dark period.
[SPEAKER_06]: The total lit period came to about 14
hours and 20 minutes, leaving nine hours
[SPEAKER_06]: and 40 minutes of darkness.
[SPEAKER_06]: The critical period for this plant was
nine hours and 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it were given just 10 hours of dark
period daily indoors rather than 12,
[SPEAKER_06]: it would still flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gardeners growing indoors who discover the
critical time needed to induce flowering
[SPEAKER_06]: can use this information to get more
efficient use of their indoor garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: Currently, plants grown under a 12-12
cycle spend half their time in the dark.
[SPEAKER_06]: If these plants have a critical flowering
time of, for instance, 10 hours of
[SPEAKER_06]: darkness daily, they can be provided 14
rather than 12 hours of light each day so
[SPEAKER_06]: that they can receive almost 17% more
energy, which they use to produce sugars
[SPEAKER_06]: used for more and faster growth.
[SPEAKER_06]: So does that make any sense, you guys?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called the critical period for the
specific strain.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of your like Cush strains,
your Indica stuff, that's going to have a
[SPEAKER_06]: critical period apparently closer to...
That's going to have like your 12-hour
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your more equatorial stuff, you may be
able to cut that down just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I heard DJ Short say that he
runs most of his plants on a 13 off 11 on,
[SPEAKER_06]: and he said that that shows a little bit
more phenotypical expression is what that
[SPEAKER_06]: does, which means that if you're growing
from seed and you're trying to find that
[SPEAKER_06]: keeper, you'll get to see larger variances
in your seed stock if you've got a little
[SPEAKER_06]: F1 hybrid there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had another article, I got to click back
a couple of steps here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I've lost it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I learned a whole lot of stuff about...
Here it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I hate to stumble through that,
but I'm looking for stuff on the internet
[SPEAKER_06]: while I'm talking.
[SPEAKER_06]: This guy broke something down.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are things... Cannabis plants...
Where is this coming from?
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me give credit.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is from marijuanagrowershq.com,
slash light cycles and flowering cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: It says,
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're going to start abbreviating
that, so I need to try to remember which
[SPEAKER_06]: is which.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't give me a definition of what
those are.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember what NM is, and that's...
I should.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I went blank on that one just now
when they wrote it on the screen.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is where it gets a little confusing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And cannabis plants, the normal presence
of the photo period, phytochrome far red
[SPEAKER_06]: is quickly produced when plants are
exposed to light that contains far red
[SPEAKER_06]: wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_06]: When there is light, the phytochrome far
red and phytochrome red maintain a
[SPEAKER_06]: balance.
[SPEAKER_06]: When the sun goes down or the lights go
out, the darkness gradually switches the
[SPEAKER_06]: phytochrome far red to phytochrome red.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because of this, the phytochrome red
levels gradually increase and the far red
[SPEAKER_06]: gradually decreases during the dark
period.
[SPEAKER_06]: The presence of red is a neutral condition
to the plants and essentially tells them
[SPEAKER_06]: nothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: When the light returns or if a small
amount of far red light interrupts the
[SPEAKER_06]: dark period, the red immediately switches
back to far red.
[SPEAKER_06]: If the plant is without light long enough,
the far red will decrease past a tipping
[SPEAKER_06]: point.
[SPEAKER_06]: This decreased level of phytochrome far
red signals the plants that fall is
[SPEAKER_06]: approaching and the plants begin
flowering.
[SPEAKER_06]: In short, the presence of phytochrome far
red due to long hours of light and short
[SPEAKER_06]: hours of darkness keep the plants in the
vegetative phase.
[SPEAKER_06]: If the plant experiences enough hours of
darkness, most of the phytochrome far red
[SPEAKER_06]: turns to phytochrome red and the low level
of far red signals the plant hormones to
[SPEAKER_06]: begin flowering.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a really technical version of what
I tried to say the last time I gave this
[SPEAKER_06]: little rant and I think I got it
completely backwards to tell you the
[SPEAKER_06]: honest truth.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that goes to show you right there that
sometimes you got to do your research,
[SPEAKER_06]: you got to remind yourself even if you
think you know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You might fuck up and say something wrong
on a podcast and try to embarrass
[SPEAKER_06]: yourself, but you know, I don't feel
embarrassed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad that I got to learn with you
guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to go find out what that one
little abbreviation that they wrote there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never seen it written like that
before.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to find out what that means so I
can share that with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where was it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Going to Google that and find out what
that means.
[SPEAKER_06]: Googling it right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: NM light.
[SPEAKER_06]: Measurement definition pops up as soon as
I start typing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Visible light is usually defined as having
a wavelength.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is nanometers what I thought it
was.
[SPEAKER_06]: They just wrote it small N capital M and I
haven't seen it like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's nanometers is what I thought it
was there in that article.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Doing pretty good on that one until Safari
just decided to freeze up.
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, man, this is going to be a short
episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really just wanted to come on and talk
about having to cancel the committee for
[SPEAKER_06]: the responsible regulation of cannabis
party that we were going to have at the
[SPEAKER_06]: break yard.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say that once again,
in case you guys are skimming through this
[SPEAKER_06]: episode, the party, the seminar,
the educational seminar we planned to
[SPEAKER_06]: host, it has been canceled.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to take some live plants and
show you guys those.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had people that were going to talk
about all kinds of cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a miniature job fair planned out.
[SPEAKER_06]: The city of Pueblo does not want that to
happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I apologize.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's beyond our control.
[SPEAKER_06]: The police department have threatened us
and scared us and we don't want police
[SPEAKER_06]: interaction.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to back out and we're going
to bow down and just not do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the best we can do right now for what
we've got.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Enough begging for your forgiveness.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you were planning to come out,
message me and we'll find something else
[SPEAKER_06]: to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're listening on Twitter or
Facebook or whatever, message me and we
[SPEAKER_06]: will hang out since I had that night
booked because I thought I'd be doing
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, let's wrap up this episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of a quick episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to give another, I want to mention
that coupon or that ad that Hygro Pueblo
[SPEAKER_06]: and Hygro Denver are both doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get yourself a gigantic bag of
roots organic soil for 550 bucks or $600.
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, dude, 25, seven gallon pots or
57 gallon pots worth of soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's two runs in a four light room,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if that tells you anything with what

[SPEAKER_06]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for coming, man.

[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, no problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm sitting here watching him struggle
with this packaging and he's, he's bid at
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's starting to grab instruments and
trying to like cut it open.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got a pair of scissors, probably 20.

[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: That reminds me part of our talk.

[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to episode number 22 of the
agriculture podcast.

[SPEAKER_06]: Big shout out to my friend that helped me
trim tonight.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're listening to the podcast,
a short person with dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_06]: You helped out a lot, saved me a lot of
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just dropped a bunch of weed into
this edible.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just picked up scissors that we were
using to trim to open this package.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, they're package compliant,
dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, this company, uh, there's an
expiration date on here.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a barcode on here.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a made on date.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then inside, yeah, inside of here,
uh, this is like bulletproof, Kevlar,
[SPEAKER_06]: fireproof, bombproof plastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, it took, uh, Fiskars scissors to get
through this shit and they struggled a
[SPEAKER_06]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fiskars are your lawn scissors,
just to let you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now Fiskars are the fucking diamond tip
trim scissors, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, I'm going to do, read an ad for a
sponsor while I struggle to get this open
[SPEAKER_06]: right quick.

[SPEAKER_06]: If you buy a certain amount of Airy
Genetics, you will get a certain amount
[SPEAKER_06]: for free.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember exactly what the special
is.
[SPEAKER_06]: It changes so frequently.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to quote it on the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: The code word we gave out, uh,
does expire the 31st of this month.
[SPEAKER_06]: It will put
[SPEAKER_06]: out a new one at the next podcast,
the start of August.
[SPEAKER_06]: Package.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got it mostly open and now I'm
struggling with not shoving it into my
[SPEAKER_06]: face in the middle of a commercial.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to get these done and then we'll go
for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, this podcast is also brought to you by
Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies has two
locations to serve Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: Visit the Denver store at 8271 Beach
Street, Unit F, or stop by the new Pueblo
[SPEAKER_06]: location on 618 East 4th Street in Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check out Hygro for competitive pricing
and a great selection on indoor growing
[SPEAKER_06]: supplies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure you check out www.hygrodenver
.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: For current store hours and special sales
also, they're running a special.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have the paper in front of me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is $550 for one tote of soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I talked about this last week,
a tote of soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's if you pick it up at the store,
it's $550.
[SPEAKER_06]: It comes in one bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's roots, organic soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, how much is a tote?
[SPEAKER_06]: That is approximately in my measurements.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that is about 28 or up.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was about 48 to 50 seven gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can run an eight light setup pretty
decently with this one package of soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you need it delivered, it is $600.
[SPEAKER_06]: It comes on a FedEx truck to your house.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not like the hydro shop has shown
up with a truck or anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually FedEx.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like you got a package that's
fucking huge.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, that's going to be a lot of weight.
[SPEAKER_06]: So hopefully they can haul it right into
your garden area or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not going to have to deal with
moving that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So check out our good friends at Hygro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I want to give a huge shout out to
Jesse, uh, and Bernadette.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, they got me.
[SPEAKER_06]: They got married this weekend.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bern actually works at Hygro.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what made me think about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They got married.
[SPEAKER_06]: They threw an awesome party.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to give them a quick shout out
of congratulations at the start of the
[SPEAKER_06]: show.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to talk a little more about
that in a few minutes here.
[SPEAKER_06]: You look like you got something to say
about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I was just going to say
congratulations.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your wedding was awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, uh, oil slick is next.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to oil slick.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oil slick is a loyal sponsor.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've been a long time sponsor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I use an oil slick product every day,
every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's almost one in every room of my
house.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think one of the most used products in
this house.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, carb caps, uh, dabbers, oil slick
pads, uh, and a rig and a torch.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need a torch sponsor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Vector, vector torches come hit me up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if somebody's got another email for me,
cause this one's starting to lose its
[SPEAKER_06]: luster.
[SPEAKER_06]: The email company wants to sponsor us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's review your product and shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll shout you out on the show all
the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Enough pandering.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, oil slick.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to our friends at oil slick,
oil slick tools to help you concentrate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check out oil slick pad.com for more
information.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, dude, go find our friends oil slick on
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_06]: I say that every time, but go find them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, they're at oil slick pad, uh,
send them a tweet and let them know that
[SPEAKER_06]: you're listening to the agriculture
podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let them know you heard this ad and that
my advertising is effective.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let them know that you're paying attention
and that it's working for them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know right now you're probably in the
garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be driving in the car.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe you're on a treadmill.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, what do you do when you're listening
to the podcast?
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, usually game.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, what you're playing video games.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So then you don't have your hands
available to go and tweet me something,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: Try to remember it later, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just, just tweet us.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I ask for a lot, but that's all.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want is a simple tweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just pay attention.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kidding.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm oil slick.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just, I mean, dude, they're, they're
constantly coming up with good Twitter
[SPEAKER_06]: pictures just alone.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm following them because of
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're dabbing, uh, the reason I
have them as a sponsor is because I use
[SPEAKER_06]: their stuff because it's necessity.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's useful.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're dabbing, you need some oil slick
products.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need something to keep your hash in.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're smoking the live resin that
we've got now, you don't want to carry it
[SPEAKER_06]: around in parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want your live resin to be kept in
like a nice smooth looking oil slick
[SPEAKER_06]: container.
[SPEAKER_06]: My red, golden green rostec colored oil
slick container.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the table with my oil slick pads.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just looks classy.
[SPEAKER_06]: They got, they got these things here with
like the magnetic sides too, where you can
[SPEAKER_06]: just put your slab in.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to have to fucking Google that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I'm not sure if that's actually
their product or if somebody's making that
[SPEAKER_06]: a modified version.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I can't find it on their website,
but the oil slick, if you're listening,
[SPEAKER_06]: no, no, no, we're going to have to find
out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, if you have a miniature size
slab, you can take two of these,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, oil slick, uh, uh, mini pads,
slick pad minis, and you can rubber band
[SPEAKER_06]: them together with your slab in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you can find other ways to stick them
together and just have your slab right in
[SPEAKER_06]: the middle and make it easily accessible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, they're great things.
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually use it almost as a,
uh, I wipe my dabber off on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why it's all sticky on this edge
near me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, so I take another dab, wipe it off on
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: My next dab doesn't have residue of my
last dab on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every dab is fresh.
[SPEAKER_06]: And not only that, but I've, I've,
you know, I've seen you use them to set
[SPEAKER_06]: pipes down on just for- I usually try to
have it like a coaster because the tables
[SPEAKER_06]: would, and I think it's just a little
better than fucking dropping my glass onto
[SPEAKER_06]: the table.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have that little pad underneath it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not all the glass is heavy and thick.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my domes for my domed rigs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I don't, there's one domed rig on
the table now that the dome sits on there
[SPEAKER_06]: because you leave, uh, I made an ad that
said, stop leaving sticky rings in your
[SPEAKER_06]: mom's table because everybody's tables got
those little rings.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could tell who's a dabber and who
tries to hide it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a huge shout out to our friends
at oil slick.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, man, oil slick has been a huge
sponsor.
[SPEAKER_06]: I totally represent that shit all day
long.
[SPEAKER_06]: So thanks guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for sponsoring us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, seriously go to their website.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, did I say it already?
[SPEAKER_06]: Where is it written?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, um, the oil slick pad.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, go there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I also have to give one more ad shout

[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like you and I was like tree
thugger, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the revolution.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the revolution.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just got seven Facebook messages in a
row.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess the internet's back.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think your phone was not working earlier
because the internet was down.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's what the problem was.
[SPEAKER_06]: The internet is back on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay.
[SPEAKER_06]: We might be able to read some news since
the internet's back.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't able to research much news
because the internet was crooked.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, uh, so we got the ads out of the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Much respect to all those sponsors.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do want to give a big shout out to our
friends at natural mystic cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: caregivers and Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, Shelley, you're awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, big digital hug to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if you get to listen to the
show, but either way, I'm sending you out
[SPEAKER_06]: a big digital, a thoughtful hug.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, Joey, what's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank for that clone.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I should say that on the
show.
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't give me a clone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, but man, thanks for that clone.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really needed that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That helps me out in a big, big way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Huge shout out to natural mystic cannabis
caregivers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I think that's all the ads I'm
responsible for this week.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I've got this thing open.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, let's eat an edible.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is where we all started 10 minutes
ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, this is six ounces, 168 grams of
chocolate and peanut butter is what it
[SPEAKER_06]: looks like to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: 350 milligrams active cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Medicinal product keep out of reach of
children.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, the packaging is quite fancy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to read you the back just cause
this is a really, this, they did a hell of
[SPEAKER_06]: a good job on the packaging.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the outer box.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, this product is infused with medical
marijuana and then was provided without
[SPEAKER_06]: regular regulatory oversight for health
safety or efficacy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there may be health risks associated
with the consumption of the product.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep out of the reach of children
processed in a facility that may,
[SPEAKER_06]: may contain nuts.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's peanut butter in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, there may be additional health risks
associated with the consumption of this
[SPEAKER_06]: product for women who are pregnant,
breastfeeding, or planning on becoming
[SPEAKER_06]: pregnant.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty much anyone in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_06]: This product is unlawful outside the state
of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: The intoxicating effects of this product
may be delayed by two or more hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do not drive a motor vehicle or operate
heavy machinery while using medical
[SPEAKER_06]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, it's got a phone number and an OPC
license like it should.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, the ingredients, uh, caught my
attention.
[SPEAKER_06]: Eggs, flour, baking soda, salt,
cocoa powder.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm reading all the whole fucking wrapper.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, but I've got a point.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, peanut butter, butter, powdered sugar,
chocolate, hash butter, uh, 0.5 grams,
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis weight, 0.5 grams dosage,
50 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is supposed to be a seven dose,
uh, edible here is what they're,
[SPEAKER_06]: they have intended.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to eat the whole damn thing is
what I have planned right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a napkin.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a drink.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is going to go down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what's got my attention is it lists
other ingredients.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has P, uh, 51.9%.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: 38.1% and 11 point, sorry, I should back
up nitrogen, phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I didn't mean the wrong order,
but that's, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Now those are the nutrients used in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, phosphorus, potassium and nitrogen,
uh, calcium, magnesium, sulfur.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what that one means.
[SPEAKER_06]: I should, but I'm, uh, I don't know the
table of L.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't do it either.
[SPEAKER_06]: The table of elements.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had the periodic table of elements.
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't say it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was reading these by sugar, all the
extracts.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they list also what it was.
[SPEAKER_06]: Grown with and on the bottom here,
organic neem oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, so they also list some of the stuff
that was used to treat the plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty interesting that they list
that on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know almost everything that went into
this products that I'm going to eat,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is kind of, kind of nice to know.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's get down to the fucking point.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to put this edible in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to turn up some task rocks.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to hear me chewing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It stinks like it, uh, I bit it open and
as soon as my mouth, my teeth broke the
[SPEAKER_06]: seal.
[SPEAKER_06]: It smelled like, uh, old school pot food.
[SPEAKER_06]: It really smells like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's in a smell-proof vacuum sealed
wrapper.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't smell this wrapper.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to open it up a little more to
slide this out easily and it fucking won't
[SPEAKER_06]: rip.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a bullet for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can make parachutes out of this shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Greenhouse material.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm almost to the first bite.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's green.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy crap.
So
[SPEAKER_06]: it's delicious.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a chocolatey and peanut buttery.
[SPEAKER_06]: So is it, is it almost like an ice cream
type of bar or does it have a softer?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like texture.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's not like hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: The top layer is straight creamy peanut
butter.
[SPEAKER_06]: The bottom layer is soft.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a, almost a soggy brownie,
but better.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alrighty.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what that texture is.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's almost a fudge, like a nougat.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's harder than that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to give you some, but I want to eat
the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to fucking experience this.
[SPEAKER_06]: As I said, I think they have these down
here at the shop and speaking of shops,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, it's a peanut butter bar.
[SPEAKER_06]: So whatever they make a peanut.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, Publin is a step their game up
because you know, they're bud down there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like driving to Springs.
[SPEAKER_06]: We went to Natural Mystic Cannabis
Caregivers to pick up some shatter because
[SPEAKER_06]: we were low on shatter and we were just
waiting for things to happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I took Adam.
[SPEAKER_06]: Adam doesn't get to go to a lot of
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_06]: I took Adam with me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, he's been shopping at Pueblo shops.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, so Natural Mystic Cannabis Caregivers
blew your mind, huh?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, their bud quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, they were big, hard nuggets of joy,
you know, like they love those plants
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't, oh, let's see how quickly we
can turn this out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, for number one, I think it was still
only medical, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that shop is only medical.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's one of the, you know,
one of the reasons, but then again,
[SPEAKER_06]: there's still medical shops that don't
give a damn.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a lot of chocolate and peanut
butter.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're like, uh, if you're actually
sick and have like cancer or something,
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know that this, I'm not knocking
the product.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fucking delicious.
[SPEAKER_06]: I get acne from chocolate.
[SPEAKER_06]: This would break out in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like while you're eating it, you'd get
zits.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's rich.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a bag of M&M's the other day.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's supposed to be seven doses.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if that's supposed to be seven doses,
I'm a good four doses in by now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And see, uh, that last drink that I
bought, that's what I thought too.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I was like, I was like,
I marked the lines on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, go, go, go.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I was down to here and I was
like, oh well, you know, here you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're talking about the chai high.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, it wasn't a chai high.
[SPEAKER_06]: It may have been that chai high.
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that what it was called?
[SPEAKER_06]: You showed me the bottle in a picture.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was so worthless to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our little trimmer friend that was here
earlier, uh, who used to work at a shop.
[SPEAKER_06]: She said she used to drink those and
sometimes it would wreck her and sometimes
[SPEAKER_06]: it wouldn't do anything to her.
[SPEAKER_06]: She said, and it may have been,
that's what she was saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: The lady at the shops, he said,
next time try a fruit flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They had like an apple cider type and I
was, yeah, I was like, yeah, that's me
[SPEAKER_06]: dude all day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and then they went, all they had was
some cappuccino.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like I said, it was like watered down,
you who do, there was no cannabis at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I just, when he said watered down,
you who did anybody else think of the
[SPEAKER_06]: Beastie Boys song?
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, Professor Booty has a song.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: If anybody else knows what I'm talking
about, tweet me about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be really cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just tweet me a hashtag Professor Booty at
I Grow Culture.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll send you stickers.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll send you an irie genetic sticker or
two.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just like the interaction.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm begging for attention.
[SPEAKER_06]: This thing's delicious.
[SPEAKER_06]: It reminds me of, remember the little
Debbie Nutty bars?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It tastes like, or a peanut butter bar.
[SPEAKER_06]: I buy those for the kids, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, yeah, it's like one of those,
but it's better.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's better.
[SPEAKER_06]: A hippie made this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would bet.
[SPEAKER_05]: A hippie made this.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is one of those snacks.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was going to buy another brand
because they're delicious.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I'm reluctant to say the brand I was
opting to buy that I chose this over.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going, I asked for a monkey bar
because the monkey bars, I love a monkey
[SPEAKER_06]: bar, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love from Incredibles.
[SPEAKER_06]: So shout out Incredibles.
[SPEAKER_06]: The monkey bar is delicious.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to buy one of those.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the girl that works at the,
the lady that works at the dispensary is a
[SPEAKER_06]: friend of mine and also a patient.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's a cancer survivor and she uses these
products.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she said, I know you like the
Incredibles.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're a hundred milligrams.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're $10.
[SPEAKER_06]: This mountain medicine peanut butter bar
is $11.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's got 350 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like three and a half of those for
a dollar more.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, you know, the businessman in me
didn't take a lot of convincing to say,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just three for one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just handed her money and thanked
her for being such a great person.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, the flavor so far, I am happy with my
decision.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I, I know that I'm going to be
wrecked.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we better get anything out of the way
that we need to handle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you sure you want to eat all of it?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to eat all of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Be a man.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause you don't know high five and
everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know if it got melted and all 350
brand of this bite and all 350 brand to
[SPEAKER_06]: here.
[SPEAKER_06]: As you're saying, there's a, it's almost
like a different kind of chocolate.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would almost kind of imagine that it's,
you see how right there, there's like a
[SPEAKER_06]: big splash of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like a chocolate chip or something
inside of some peanut butter batter stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got the works, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a layer of, uh, semi-dark chocolate
over peanut butter.
[SPEAKER_06]: With this peanut butter chocolate,
uh, it's a thick mousse, a light fudge
[SPEAKER_06]: sort of a texture.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, uh, I can eat it quickly and it
does, it's not so peanut buttery that I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: stuck while I'm trying to talk,
but it does take a little effort to clean
[SPEAKER_06]: up the face while you're grubbing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the summertime, eat this in the air
conditioner.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't try to take this out anywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause she told you to kind of put it in
the fridge for five or 10 minutes
[SPEAKER_05]: beforehand, or she said actually put it in
the microwave or warm it up first.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, she did.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, this would have been, uh, I don't know
that I'd recommend that.
[SPEAKER_06]: This would just be a puddle.
[SPEAKER_05]: She didn't say long.
[SPEAKER_05]: She said like one second, two seconds,
you know, but yeah, take a couple more
[SPEAKER_05]: bites of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think maybe, uh, just putting it in the
refrigerator would be even better.
[SPEAKER_06]: Was there a strain at Natural Mystic
Cannabis Caregivers that got your
[SPEAKER_06]: attention?
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause they had some great looking,
uh, herbs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I smelled a couple of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, there was only one of them that I
really knew what the smell was.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, that was my only comparison.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, they had Harlequin there that was,
I, I haven't smelled that yet and it was,
[SPEAKER_05]: wow, it was really potent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, what was the, what was the other one
that we got?
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, or that you got that day that they had
the strain there?
[SPEAKER_05]: The Tora Bora?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, not the Tora Bora.
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it the Super Lemon Haze?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't remember which one.
[SPEAKER_06]: They had one that just stunk to high hell
and it was great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, that's the one I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: The one where it's, that's what we got
some of the shatter was.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the guava.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the guava.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that really impressed me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, that, she opened the jar and it was
like a punch in the face before she handed
[SPEAKER_05]: it to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, like, I said, there was no
small nugs in the jar and everything was
[SPEAKER_06]: frosty.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything was right to that point where I
feel like I could have brought it home and
[SPEAKER_06]: kept it in my jar for a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it would have been like, you know,
I could have judged where, how dry or how
[SPEAKER_06]: wet I wanted it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You tend to like, Adam tends to like his
weed a little crispier than most folks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Adam likes it a little drier.
[SPEAKER_06]: We like, uh, so we'll cure it perfectly
and then give it to Adam to destroy it for
[SPEAKER_06]: us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: But still it's, it's nice to have that
option instead of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm where I'm from.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, you get something wet,
you're like, what is this?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm all in now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just put the rest of this thing in my
mouth up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't shitting about that final thing
filled with butter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause that last bite tastes like butter,
not even like chocolate or pie.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like butter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, just butter, huh?
[SPEAKER_06]: Paula Deen made that, huh?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've never had a chance to say this on
like a public platform, but fuck Paula
[SPEAKER_06]: Deen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, here, here.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, fuck her before her racism,
but extra fucking before her racism.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to get this chocolate peanut
butter mix in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I had an Italian girlfriend and we
would watch Giada De Laurentiis and Paula
[SPEAKER_06]: Deen back to back.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think Alton Brown was on in the mix.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm wiping my face.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got chocolate, fucking chocolate,
peanut butter, butter all over the place.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chocolate, peanut butter, butter.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could feel the butter on my lips.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, it tastes like movie theater
popcorn in that last bite.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Paula Deen, one day she's making a meal
and she's like, this meal got a little sum
[SPEAKER_06]: for everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, except the vegetarians, but screw
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can go outside and eat grass.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you, Paula Deen.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go outside and eat grass
while your show's on and never watch your
[SPEAKER_06]: fucking show again.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would go outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm not going to go down that road in
your podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go outside and smoke grass
until Paula Deen's over.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never really done a fuck you on the
show.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel almost a little bad now,
but fuck you Paula Deen.
[SPEAKER_06]: You suck.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're racist.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're fucking rude to vegetarians.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I do, I sent her a letter.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, I will go outside and eat
grass until Giada De Laurentiis comes
[SPEAKER_06]: back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't you have a correction or something
that you did?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever, Adam.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can drive the podcast today,
bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I wasn't trying to drive the podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: The correction.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're totally right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I ate an edible and you're going to have
to keep me on track.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to have to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Guys, we've been smoking live resin and
unicorn hash and butt naked, also known as
[SPEAKER_06]: bear naked, depends on where you are.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't know about the unicorn hash,
the live resin or the butt naked,
[SPEAKER_06]: you don't even know, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: The love resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: The love resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You heard all of that shit here first on
the agriculture podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to ask questions later.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got answers.
[SPEAKER_06]: A correction.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did an episode about veg growth.
[SPEAKER_06]: At some point in the episode, I said,
keep your veg plants on 1212.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't fucking do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I fucked up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I said something wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is me being a man and telling you I
fucking said that wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm correcting myself right now on the air
where I have the chance.
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am the captain of this ship and I almost
drove it into the wall.
[SPEAKER_06]: And see, now I feel kind of like an
asshole because I forgot it was about
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was something else because I
thought you corrected about that last week
[SPEAKER_05]: or the last podcast episode you did.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that was correcting my... Now you're
pointing out that I fucked up twice,
dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just edit this shit out.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I believe you're saying we're awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we're awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I did.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I said I'm being a man about
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could just be like, no, fuck that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll just keep talking like that didn't
happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we got to correct it because I am the
captain of this fucking pirate ship right
[SPEAKER_06]: here.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is my ship that I'm driving and I got
to guide you guys into the right way.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're all going to fail together and I
want you to win is why I'm doing a show.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to improve your growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to adjust the music.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tess got a little loud for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I want to make your growing better.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, my first mistake was I don't even
know if I said it on the podcast or in a
[SPEAKER_06]: personal conversation, but I mentioned the
red light spectrum and I got it totally
[SPEAKER_06]: backwards.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then my second mistake was saying to
keep your vegging plants on 1212.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do not do this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep your vegging plants on at least 18
hours of light, at least 16 hours of
[SPEAKER_06]: light.
[SPEAKER_06]: 18 would be better.
[SPEAKER_06]: 24 is what I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: To be perfectly fair, you didn't say it
like, uh, by the way, put your plants,
[SPEAKER_05]: no, it was at the end of your sentence,
at the end of your lesson, at the end of
[SPEAKER_05]: your ramble of how lights work.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's probably high.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You would definitely back probably been
doing it, doing a show for an hour.
[SPEAKER_06]: So excuse me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize, but I admit it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I fucked up and I'm driving this boat.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just telling you from a listener's
point of view, tighten your shit up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be buying more of these edibles.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's so good, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got this chocolate peanut,
chocolate peanut butter is a pothead's
[SPEAKER_06]: treat in my mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got it in my mouth and it tastes so
good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a peanut butter fudge dude from Sonic.
[SPEAKER_06]: This song that's popping up right now is
called hashtag and you can't get enough
[SPEAKER_06]: though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause chocolate peanut butter and you
can't get enough though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me know because I'd, like I said,
I would have definitely been like,
[SPEAKER_05]: yo, 11 bucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll be here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we did a correction.
[SPEAKER_06]: I ate the edible.
[SPEAKER_06]: God damn.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: We should talk about Jesse's wedding
reception.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to give a big shout out to Jesse
and Bern, of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Witt.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to meet Jesse's father.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a character there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That guy is awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: He can party harder than you and me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then if we cloned each of us and set
them next to us, he would win.
[SPEAKER_06]: He would out dab us.
[SPEAKER_06]: He would out whiskey us.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he would look at us and be like,
why are you guys so fucked up?
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: He is a professional and he's a man to the
man's man world.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a champ.
[SPEAKER_06]: So shout out.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was great meeting you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he listens to the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: So big handshake, Mr. Witt.
[SPEAKER_06]: The wedding reception was great.
[SPEAKER_06]: The bride looked beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: The groom, well, he was pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: So about halfway through the night,
he decided to wear a young lady's wife
[SPEAKER_06]: beater for the rest of the evening.
[SPEAKER_06]: Each nipple stuck out just a little bit
and he's quite a hairy man.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it looked great in the beard.
[SPEAKER_06]: You looked great through the start of the
night, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then once you done to the wife beater,
I threw up in my mouth a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I just did.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just hearing about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to the Garden of Weedon crew.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody showed up looking classy as a
motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think if you say classy as fuck,
that describes them perfectly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Spence looked sharp as shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maddie has always looked beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big Mike was fucking dressed to the nines.
[SPEAKER_06]: Joe even brought a skateboard to skate in
this cool place.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then of course, my, my homie Sloppy
looked sharp as hell.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fung, we wish you were there, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you listen to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fung is out of town.
[SPEAKER_06]: We miss you, Fung.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a somber note right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the wedding reception, I didn't go
to the actual wedding.
[SPEAKER_06]: The pothead crew, as I was calling us,
wasn't, we chose to just go to the after.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was like a wedding and then a
reception and then kind of an after party
[SPEAKER_06]: that started about eight 30.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once the kids bailed out, we set up a dab
bar and Spence from the Garden of Weedon
[SPEAKER_06]: and myself with also the help of Maddie.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I missed anybody in the Garden of
Weedon listening to people, I'm sorry,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got like 9,000 thoughts in my head at
once.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't mean to miss anybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love all you guys at the Garden of
Weedon, Siroc and Nana included,
[SPEAKER_06]: and even Honey.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Spence and Maddie and I were pretty
much giving out dabs to the entire wedding
[SPEAKER_06]: party that was over 21 and stuck around
after the, the old folks and the children
[SPEAKER_06]: left.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shit, some of the old folks got down
better than the youngsters.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we had an e-nail, we had a regular rig
and we couldn't keep up with the dabs that
[SPEAKER_06]: people were wanting because Jesse handed
me his live resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: He gave me a nice chunk of live resin to
dab out the wedding party and he said,
[SPEAKER_06]: guard this with your life.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was my job.
[SPEAKER_06]: I volunteered to go there and be the dab
tender.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we set up a little dab bar and I needed
help.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's like, I know you'll fucking give
out good dabs and I know you know how to
[SPEAKER_06]: manage dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: So dishing out dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm getting buzzed, I think, from that.
[SPEAKER_06]: My head just swirled.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll take a dab here in just a minute
too.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll slowly watch Jeff DeGrade.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll start melting here.
[SPEAKER_06]: If anybody's got that weed, if you've seen
that commercial that that girl smoked and
[SPEAKER_06]: she fucking melts into the couch and
becomes like Play-Doh, if you have any of
[SPEAKER_06]: that weed and or hash, hit me up at
iGrowCulture on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're lying to you, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've been lying to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was Photoshopped.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did she Photoshop that chick?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want some of that weed, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: That looks like some great shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that pink stuff in that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think we dished out probably seven to
ten grams of live resin last night to the
[SPEAKER_06]: wedding party.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people kept coming back and coming
back.
[SPEAKER_06]: We probably broke the dab record for
Pueblo County in one building at one time
[SPEAKER_06]: with a certain amount of people.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what the fucking dab
logistics were, but dude, we won.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm guessing on an average day and people
are going to shit their pants.
[SPEAKER_06]: I take 25 dabs, no problem, on an average
day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe 30 or 40 on a heavy dab day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've gone to secret cups and we've had to
judge 42 samples and I've done those all
[SPEAKER_06]: in one day and was okay and went back for
seconds on a couple.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm in the 25 to 50 dabs per day range,
which I don't know if that's- That sounds
[SPEAKER_06]: like a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you see the size of dabs he does,
it is a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's odd is I'll wake up and I'll
rock for a few hours before I take a dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: I try to do a couple things.
[SPEAKER_06]: I try to get food and water in my body and
fucking check my email before I get too
[SPEAKER_06]: dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I come over here six, seven o'clock at
night and you- Yeah, I haven't taken a dab
[SPEAKER_06]: yet because if you take that, if you get
up at a reasonable time, somewhere between
[SPEAKER_06]: eight and 10, do your day, get some food
in you, get functional, get your blood
[SPEAKER_06]: moving and don't take a dab till seven,
10 in the afternoon or the evening,
[SPEAKER_06]: you get fucking higher than you would.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, but what I was going to say is I
wait until like six or seven or 420.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lately it's been too hot to get dabbed out
all day.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you got to wait until fucking six and
the sun starts going down and then by nine
[SPEAKER_06]: you can get dabbed the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I'll take fucking seven dabs per
hour.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll sit down and take six dabs in
succession in 20 or 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you're shaking your head because I
ruin you doing it, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel bad for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel bad for your lungs.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sitting here shaking my head thinking-
Imagine if I was doing bong hits of flour
[SPEAKER_06]: that much though.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's what I'm thinking though is I
smoke flour most of the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not- If I'm just sitting there
smoking 10 bong hits of flour,
[SPEAKER_05]: or if I'm just sitting there smoking by
myself, it's two.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then another four or five hours later,
two more.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I get what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: I go slower with the dabs than I do with
the flour.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your lungs are like anything I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a smoker too.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got a certain amount of inhales
and exhales your lungs are going to give
[SPEAKER_06]: you before they start to burn out,
just like any sort of equipment or fucking
[SPEAKER_06]: device or moving thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything that moves is going to break
eventually.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I've only got 72 billion ins and
outs, I'd rather spend half of those on a
[SPEAKER_06]: dab than three quarters of them trying to
smoke herb.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I should just get half of those on
oxygen, at least half, but you know what I
[SPEAKER_06]: mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm turning- Hey, no, I get what you're
saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's understandable.
[SPEAKER_06]: My vapor to smoke ratio.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, tonight would have been the night
that we would have done that event at the
[SPEAKER_06]: Mary Jane's and at the Hukaburra.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to give an apology to everybody
that was excited about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I myself was excited.
[SPEAKER_06]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_06]: There were some bureaucracy discrepancies
and some stuff that happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm no longer a member of the Citizens
for the Responsible Regulation of
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if that even exists anymore
to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've backed out of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just going to stick with being a breeder
and a podcast host and doing what I know
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm good at.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to go to city council meetings and
stuff when I was with another dispensary
[SPEAKER_06]: group.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like being in that realm.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a little uncomfortable to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd rather just kind of- It's one thing
going there when you have to.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when you're just voluntarily going
there and- It still feels like court.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once you've been to court, going in the
courtroom type building, it still feels
[SPEAKER_06]: like court.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're judging you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Completely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I backed out of going to those meetings
because I felt like I was a hindrance to
[SPEAKER_06]: the group because I'm just a cliche
looking pod.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I didn't speak anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had spokespeople for the group,
so I just quit going.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you want to know the worst thing that
I think about courtrooms?
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't wear a hat.
[SPEAKER_05]: No hats.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your long hair, you can't hide it from
anyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't hide my dreadlocks anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no hiding these dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was talking about the wedding reception
and we got away sidetracked, but that's
[SPEAKER_06]: cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just having a fun episode this time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Side track, dab track.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just having a fun episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not going to try to do a whole bunch
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I may tell you how I dry trimmed some of
this weed, maybe.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to tease about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: The wedding was awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw a lot of people that I haven't seen
in a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Bullheaded.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Con.
[SPEAKER_06]: Con performed without Booger.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why Booger didn't show up,
but he still killed it by himself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Despicable Dialects rapped.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who else performed?
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I'm going to miss somebody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesse Witt grabbed a microphone and
rapped.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was pretty entertaining.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, a lot of people did a lot of cool
things and it was a great time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to put in the request for next
growth lesson then.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bow it down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Freestyle.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of the music's fading out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get the music back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get it going again.
[SPEAKER_06]: The wedding was awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: It went off without a hitch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything was fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody got home safely.
[SPEAKER_06]: We made sure everybody got home safe
because they got kind of silly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people got a little bit goofy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just want to make sure to give shout outs
to the Garden of Weed and Crew for running
[SPEAKER_06]: the dab bar like a champ.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout outs to those guys for getting
married.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get off the topic of them getting
married because I don't have a lot more
[SPEAKER_06]: left to say about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Live resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: I keep talking about live resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody's tweeting me, messaging me.
[SPEAKER_06]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_06]: WTF, live resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: It tastes great.
[SPEAKER_06]: It tastes great, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Less filling.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a very light love resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to take a dab of love resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's funny, I sent Adam a text message
saying, hey bro, I got some love resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I actually meant to say was live
resin and so he's been laughing at that
[SPEAKER_06]: ever since.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to take a pretty chunky dab of
some live resin right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got some friends that were kind
enough to gift me a little bit of live
[SPEAKER_06]: resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Super awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I heat the torch or heat the nail a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Less heat and make sure to use the carb
cap with the live resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to burn it up because it's a
lot more turpy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more turpinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you know about turps, that's what
mostly gives you the flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're flavonoids and palates that
contribute to that, but mostly it's the
[SPEAKER_06]: turpinoids that you want to taste.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's very clean.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see the cleanliness and the
clarity in the hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I might've talked about it a
little on the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go doing a dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a dab of live resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here, take that part.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take the torch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Task Rock for making super
awesome nails and carb caps.
[SPEAKER_06]: Highly Educated is not a sponsor of the
show, but they should be.
[SPEAKER_06]: One day they will be.
[SPEAKER_06]: Task and I have been talking.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Highly Educated.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I just took a mean dab,
so words are complicated right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to say that you can pick up
Highly Educated products.
[SPEAKER_06]: Heat it a little more, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even have your dab ready.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm over here rambling.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can pick up Highly Educated products
at Aqualabtechnologies.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: I recommend, if you've got a rig with an
18 or 14 millimeter male joint sticking
[SPEAKER_06]: out of it, I recommend the dualitye nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's probably the way to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to fit.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you've got a 10 millimeter,
there is a 10 millimeter domeless that
[SPEAKER_06]: works perfectly as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm catching my breath.
[SPEAKER_06]: And get yourself a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_06]: Carb caps are the new shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to heat your nail as hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: You drop your dab in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You let it puddle up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: You cover it with the carb cap.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it requires less heat.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you choke less and your dab tastes a
little bit better.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll need a little more heat next time,
bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: That wasn't too bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got a dab, but a little more heat will
be better for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was trying not to heat it up because of
what you just said.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll find it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I usually heat it for you when you're
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: But once your nail gets a little bit
older, you'll need to give it a little bit
[SPEAKER_06]: more heat.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something that you guys will learn
once it starts getting too worn out.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's time to replace it, by the way,
to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Task.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm giving him a big old ad.
[SPEAKER_06]: He doesn't even sponsor the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Task is a badass.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a pioneer for the community.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's done a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a hell of a rapper, too, we're
listening to in the background,
[SPEAKER_06]: also.
[SPEAKER_06]: So multi-tasker, multifaceted,
ingenious man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Live resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: You ready for this?
[SPEAKER_06]: Live resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty much take a plant that is growing,
chop it down at harvest time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been flushed.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can flush it for 10 or 14 days.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chop it down.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's harvest time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe a couple of days ago, he went
through and pulled off all the big fan
[SPEAKER_06]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: If not, hang the plant upside down to take
off all the fan leaves right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let it dry for like... And some guys are
leaving the fan leaves on.
[SPEAKER_06]: I should mention that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some guys leave the fan leaves on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially frosty strains.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let it dry for like three to four hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then chop it up into buds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And other guys are... This is one method
I've seen and it varies a little bit,
[SPEAKER_06]: but this is basically it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chop the buds off the sticks.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you just have the buds and leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have all the stems.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you got like a fucking five
gallon bucket or so, whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put that in a freezer.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you need to use bags, put them in bags
and put them in your normal freezer.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got a fancy freezer we'd be using.
[SPEAKER_06]: So freeze your buds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get them nice and frozen.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've been putting them in a deep
freeze, is what I've been seeing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then it's ran through a closed loop
system.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not there for that part most of the
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not a hash maker.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dried and cured.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, fresh.
[SPEAKER_06]: You cut down the plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll emphasize that again.
[SPEAKER_06]: You cut them down.
[SPEAKER_06]: You let them hang for like three to four
hours and take off the leaves and then
[SPEAKER_06]: freeze them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all they hang to dry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_06]: Frozen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chopped down frozen and then blasted in
the closed loop system, taken out of the
[SPEAKER_06]: closed loop system and vacuum purged.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, really gently.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not the hash maker.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the process I've observed and
gathered from hanging out with all of my
[SPEAKER_06]: friends that are extract artists.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the basics, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't rush out and... Most people,
and I sound like an asshole, most people
[SPEAKER_06]: don't have access to the machine you need
to do this.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not going to have the machine.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are a couple of specific machines
that you need to do this.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are only a couple of brands and I
don't know exactly which two everybody
[SPEAKER_06]: would recommend to fight over.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if one of them wants to sponsor the
show, hit me up.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll start talking about your machine on
the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe someone close to us, maybe where
would they even start to look once this
[SPEAKER_05]: develops, where would they look for it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Denver?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Denver is the only place I know of you can
get live resin right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was, and it's gone now, so I'm sorry
you guys, but it was there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It went fucking quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was Tangy live resin at the clinic.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was 250 bucks for three grams for one
of our friends that bought some.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's $85 a gram is roughly what
that comes to.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you got to thank your paying for the
machine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and it's kind of the hype.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's part of... I mean, how many people
have you seen on Facebook or anywhere?
One.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's our crew pretty much.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Denver crew has got it figured out.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Denver crew is smoking the live resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure who came up with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have any of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was Giddy Up is one of the
first people that I ever saw smoking live
[SPEAKER_06]: resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen it online, but it didn't look
anything like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to give Giddy Up and... Do I
even want to say the other people?
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like Giddy Up, Garden of Weedon,
maybe some Greener Side Empire.
[SPEAKER_06]: That crew, I'm going to give them credit
for inventing the Bear Naked and the Butt
[SPEAKER_06]: Naked right here on the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty sure those guys invented that shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was their idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: Giddy Up was definitely one of the
pioneers of that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now that I've recovered from my dab,
let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that smooth?
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: At present, people are arguing that it's
not cured so it can't be as good,
[SPEAKER_06]: that the fucking weed isn't as good
because it's not cured before it's
[SPEAKER_06]: blasted.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the taste not incredible?
[SPEAKER_05]: It is more flavorful than anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any shatter that I've had here.
[SPEAKER_06]: If an apple tasted like some dank weed,
this is Girl Scout Cookies weed we're
[SPEAKER_06]: dabbing.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you had a Girl Scout Cookies flavored
apple and you bit into it, you know how
[SPEAKER_06]: apples take a second for that juice to
come out of the fiber of the apple and
[SPEAKER_06]: then drip into your mouth?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what a Weedle, if you had a
Weedle, a weed apple, is that what it
[SPEAKER_06]: would taste like?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what that is where compared to
shatter would be like buying slices from a
[SPEAKER_06]: bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's already pre-cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got that air on the... It's not as
crispy.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not meaning to downgrade shatter.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just upgrading the live resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Upgrade.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got the upgrade.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's 2Ds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Upgraded.
[SPEAKER_05]: For a double dose.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're from the South if you got 2Ds in
upgrade, buddy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've never seen that movie.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody will get it out there and tweet
it to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not even going to let you know.
That's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope they do.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to shout out your Twitter
address?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's overgrowthegov.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my buddy Adam over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's from the South, so excuse some of the
shit that he says.
[SPEAKER_06]: It should be changed to Adam with no
filter.
[SPEAKER_06]: It may.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Adam with no filter over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who cares?
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just rambling, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you're having fun on the podcast
this time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been talking about maybe talking
about... Talking about maybe talking
[SPEAKER_06]: about...
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was waiting for you to catch that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I paused.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: One more thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: One more thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to toot some horns.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a live resin, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope we explained that enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're blasting fresh frozen plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't try and blast them fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Vacuum purge it really lightly because the
vacuum purge fucks up your turpenoids and
[SPEAKER_06]: it collapses a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're doing this process, you should
know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the vacuum purge lighter and a little
longer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just go lighter and longer, Leslie.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't expect to get shatter through the
same process.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not supposed to come out like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of it came out shattery.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of it is what we're calling sugary.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it looks like we fucked up.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like old school hash that we
fucked up, but it's almost clear.
[SPEAKER_06]: It tastes so fucking good, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm higher from it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cleaner.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't cough.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't cough from it.
[SPEAKER_06]: He doesn't.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do because I smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if I take...
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't die from it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I could do a half gram dab
of live resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why would you want to, though?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, because I like dropping half gram
dabs of fucking regular shatter.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that kicking the dick kind of
feeling that it gives you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess on my level, sometimes it
takes a half gram dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: YouTube video in the making.
[SPEAKER_06]: How much live resin is on this little
sheet right here?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not even big enough to be
impressive.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a lot of live resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fucking, dude, $85 a gram at the
clinic.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want me to drop a $45 gram?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or a $45 dab?
[SPEAKER_06]: This coming from the man who has burned
quite a few things that I don't even want
[SPEAKER_06]: to talk about.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll post that picture up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll post a picture somewhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's talking about me burning things.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a $100 bill.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the 4th of July.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll post that picture one day somewhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not a crime.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was afraid to post it up because I
thought that I may get in trouble for
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a crime.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an actual form of protest that's
acceptable.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a political protest, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that random, you guys?
[SPEAKER_06]: I burned a $100 bill.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a story behind that.
One?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there were $200 bills, but there's a
story behind it.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a really good story behind it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe next year.
[SPEAKER_06]: I might have to edit that part out,
but you never know.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we also sent somebody's last name that
I may have to edit out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to repeat it.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you guys didn't catch it the first
time, then you didn't catch it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to toot my own horn,
but also I'm going to recommend that you
[SPEAKER_06]: guys go and check out Cannabis Sativa,
The Essential Guide to the World's Finest
[SPEAKER_06]: Marijuana Strength Brains, edited by S.T.
Owner.
[SPEAKER_06]: The name is Stoner.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is volume three, released by Green
Candy Press.
[SPEAKER_06]: This book is $20.
[SPEAKER_06]: It should be released very soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go to amazon.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure that it's even out yet,
but when it comes out, you got to get this
[SPEAKER_06]: fucking book, dude, because on page,
I think it's 45 or 54.
[SPEAKER_06]: I suffer from it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 54.
[SPEAKER_06]: Page 54.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are some glorious photos of Golden
Goat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those photos are by myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Took those pictures.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just joking.
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually took those pictures with an
Olympus.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's it called now?
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't remember the fucking, it's a
little Olympus camera.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not even anything fancy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a Panasonic Olympus.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a little 16 fucking,
it's got a real good zoom.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a 16 X zoom on it is what's real
nice about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that thing took all the pictures in
this were taken with that cheap as a $200
[SPEAKER_06]: camera from Best Buy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's published in a book, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: That should be, so thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to give a shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for putting me in the book.
[SPEAKER_06]: I also want you guys to look at the book,
support these guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: They put out great strain guides.
[SPEAKER_06]: The description, I wrote some of it and
then it was given some liberty,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think is what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't write that the way that it's
written there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and I also am not taking credit for
creating Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not create Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_06]: This guy named Mr. Dank from Kansas
created the Golden Goat and that was not
[SPEAKER_06]: me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I simply put it into seed form.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, right now it's sold out,
but there will be more made.
[SPEAKER_06]: They went so fast.
[SPEAKER_06]: I made a test batch and they went pretty
quickly to all my test crew and they
[SPEAKER_06]: showed fucking huge potential and they
looked like Golden Goat mommy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So then I made more and I put them online.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were gone, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Nature's Green Remedies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those boys know how to hustle.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was in the book.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's Cannabis Sativa.
[SPEAKER_06]: Buy that book.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check it out, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: It will be available on Amazon if it's not
already.
[SPEAKER_06]: They do great work over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: The strain guides are important.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that we're getting into the medical
marijuana stuff and it's getting to be
[SPEAKER_06]: legal everywhere, people are going to want
to know about these strains and they're
[SPEAKER_06]: going to be growing all this crazy shit
and now we've actually got a book to kind
[SPEAKER_06]: of document it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The picture from Subcool on page 72 of
Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I never sneezed on a podcast before.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the first time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't mean to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, my eyes got so heavy when I sneezed.
[SPEAKER_06]: That edible is working.
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot all about it, honestly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't forget about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I still have the taste of chocolate and
peanut butter in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a cool book.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at that picture of East Coast Sour
Diesel.
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoever grew that.

[SPEAKER_06]: Do you remember which strain it was?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't remember.
It's towards the back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Their picture will be easy to spot because
they take amazing photography.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to La Plata Labs.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Josh and Jeff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking.
[SPEAKER_06]: Their photos are great.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was that... If you remember the
name of the strain, it'd be a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: The picture of White Diesel is glorious.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are going to want this book.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody did a good job.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of these are better than my
Instagram feed.

[SPEAKER_06]: Close.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that style.
Yeah.

[SPEAKER_06]: You're getting fidgety.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, totally fidgety.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's take a dab and try to calm me down a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're like, let's go for a walk.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to go for a walk?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd make it far.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd be like, wow, that grass is really
wet.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I got you, brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I said I was going to talk about trim
stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: We better do that because we're 49 minutes
in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_06]: Guys, I dry trim.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need a long episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I understand.
[SPEAKER_06]: I get it, but you've needed one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to do them structured, but this was
fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: This was a good idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm high as giraffe pussy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet you are.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a Joe Rogan quote, but I am
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You said hey.
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually hey is followed by a statement.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ending sentence.
[SPEAKER_06]: Guys, if you're wondering what Adam looks
like, all you got to do is watch this
[SPEAKER_06]: cartoon called King of the Hill.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a character named Lucky.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_06]: In about 10 years, Adam's going to look
just like Lucky.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get in the truck, Lou Ann.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to give a shout out to anybody
while we do a dab?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't really want to give a shout
out to anybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: All I know is that this stuff that you're
dabbing is 100%.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want one of these next time.
[SPEAKER_05]: You do.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want one of those.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I damn sure don't want to split it
with her.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, just eat the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Eat the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And make her extremely jealous.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I'll give a shout out to.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll give a shout out to my wife because
she's sitting at home while I'm sitting
[SPEAKER_05]: here dabbing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good night.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not you guys, just his wife.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good night, Christy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just dropped the torch.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I thought that was a rig, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: My heart dropped.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had it at the edge of the table because
it was hot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just had it face down right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It scared me though.
[SPEAKER_06]: That fat dab of live resin after how high
it was from that edible.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is going to be a fun end of a show
section.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it ends.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it ends.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we just podcast indefinitely?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we got everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we could do a live feed,
couldn't you?
[SPEAKER_06]: You ever Google hang out and just then
release it?
[SPEAKER_06]: You ever eat an LSD where you got into
that bubble where you don't want to leave
[SPEAKER_06]: where you are because you're just like,
I'm here and I'm safe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's how the podcast has me right
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm secure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got my little station right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got some dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a drink.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a book to read if something goes
wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got the internet.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got my little station.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm secure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the internet's back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the internet is back.
[SPEAKER_06]: The internet was down here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Concast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're expensive.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't even going to say the C word.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_06]: Concast?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're so expensive.
[SPEAKER_06]: They should work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get it together.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not that they should work.
[SPEAKER_06]: They should work past 12 o'clock to 4 o
'clock.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because unlike them, other people do
things at those hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, you know, I'm not going to
say what people do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to say that people need to
do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the internet.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: After I finish this cough, here we go with
the miniature grow lesson on dry trimming.
[SPEAKER_06]: And bear in mind, I ate a 350 milligram
edible that is highly effective.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a slow down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fucking working.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Adam will help us out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll even turn on the music.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's highly distracting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I love these songs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Task Rock's awesome, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dry trim.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wear rubber gloves for almost all of
everything that I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get the blue nitrile gloves.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are great.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're cheap.
[SPEAKER_06]: They got them at Walmart and Walgreens.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're affordable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Woo, I'm high.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: So pull the plant out of the room,
I guess, and just chop it down to the
[SPEAKER_06]: base.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then hang it upside down.
[SPEAKER_06]: I use that bottom branch.
[SPEAKER_06]: The very bottom branch where the first
fucking set of buds are.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hang that over.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes you could string up a line
across the room or maybe use like a coat
[SPEAKER_06]: hanger, depending on how many you have
going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: But wherever you're hanging it,
that's your new little hanger.
[SPEAKER_06]: That little Y, that first intersection.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I'll grab like a fuzzy stick,
a pack of fuzzy sticks from Walmart.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like a pipe cleaner.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking the thing around your bread bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: They got a bunch of those kind of things,
a little twisty tie sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wrap that around the stalk and just kind
of secure it onto whatever you're hanging
[SPEAKER_06]: it to a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because sometimes that branch will break
if you got a heavy plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to go to the second branch,
go for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Secure it on there a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to secure it either way,
just because I'm fucking OCD.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want my plants falling on the
floor after they've been growing for
[SPEAKER_06]: fucking 125 days or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to be all right,
princess?
[SPEAKER_06]: You're turning colors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, don't call me princess.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd be lucky to talk.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: This edible works.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you guys want to buy an edible,
I recommend the Mountain Medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: But know your tolerance.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Eat half of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, don't even do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Eat a quarter.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm high.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm high and I'm a professional.
[SPEAKER_05]: If something's working for you,
I know it's going to work for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to say I'm a professional and this
is fucking me up in such a good way.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I bought that 315 milligram drink,
I thought that it was going to fuck me up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you literally told me,
I want one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish we could play some Grateful Dead
music without getting the show in trouble
[SPEAKER_06]: right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where I am high.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to listen to Jack Straw.
[SPEAKER_06]: If anybody's a dead head out there,
you know where I am.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I say, I just need to hear Jack Straw,
man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody knows where you are.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody knows where I am.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody wearing a fucking tight-eyed
shirt is out there going, yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: man.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're going to play Jack Straw for
me.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we got the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hanging upside down, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to get off the fan leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now is a good time to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe you did that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some growers do that a few days before
harvest.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I should have recommended that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe a few days before harvest,
go in there and take off all your big fan
[SPEAKER_06]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you can do that right as you harvest or
you can do it as it's hanging up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just get those big fan leaves off.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now your plants are hanging upside down in
a room.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want that room at like... Fuck,
I should have wrote this down because I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: getting really high.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want a lot of humidity in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe like 25 to 30% max, maximum
humidity.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you want to have some air moving,
but not like your fan's blowing directly
[SPEAKER_06]: on the plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll crisp them up a little too
quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want them to dry a little bit slowly
while they're hanging upside down.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you got whole plants hanging upside
down, minus fan leaves, just hanging
[SPEAKER_06]: upside down.
[SPEAKER_06]: The humidity is kind of low.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep your temperatures.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want to go cold, but you don't
want to go hot either.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like 70, 75 is like right where...
That's a good area for them.
[SPEAKER_06]: We like what they like.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where you are is where they're cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mine hang kind of like in a work area
where it's a little dark.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep it dark in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would imagine it could go to
possibly 80.
[SPEAKER_05]: 80 would probably be... Kind of crisp them
up a little faster than you want,
[SPEAKER_05]: but you know... Closet if you have to,
that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just make sure you're getting air to them
if you are doing a closet or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: Air because moving air prevents mold.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just remember that.
[SPEAKER_06]: In every grow situation, moving more air
prevents mold.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like one of the... And growing is
humid.
[SPEAKER_06]: You may not even realize how much water is
involved in growing, but every gallon you
[SPEAKER_06]: pour in is coming back out somewhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you got to move that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to get rid of it or utilize it
somehow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you got these plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're upside down.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're in the room with the right
humidity.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're in the room with the right
temperature.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully it's dark, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: As dark as you can get it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to dedicate space.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got a lot of air moving so you don't
get moldy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now just let them dry up for... Shit,
I've got some that have been hanging.
[SPEAKER_06]: The plants we trimmed tonight were cut
down on a Monday.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they've almost been going for two
weeks, hanging up there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's been a little humid because we've
had a swamp cooler going in that area.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not in that area, but in a room like
three... A hallway down, I guess.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a swamp cooler in there just
because that's what that room came
[SPEAKER_06]: equipped with.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we got to run that fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but it's still getting... It still
makes a little humidity in the rest of the
[SPEAKER_06]: grow environment.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what they're sitting, they're hanging
for about 14 days is where they've been.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they don't have any fan leaves on
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: You might want to check them every other
day, every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like start checking them about four days,
five days, six days.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give them a little squeeze.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when those fan leaves or the little
sugar leaves start crisping right off just
[SPEAKER_06]: by hitting them with your finger,
grab those plants and just take like... I
[SPEAKER_06]: have these long bins and I just take
branches off the... I have the plants
[SPEAKER_06]: hanging and I cut branches off and lay
them into the bins.
[SPEAKER_06]: And once my bins are full, I go to a
seated area because you got to sit down to
[SPEAKER_06]: trim, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, it'll drive you nuts trying to stand
up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm getting old.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how I know I'm old.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't stand to trim anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you got to sit down.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just kind of hold... I cut one bud
off at a time and just knock the leaves
[SPEAKER_06]: off of it with my thumbs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because now that it's dry, those leaves
are pretty much just going to fall off.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can see what your finished product
is as you're going.
[SPEAKER_06]: So trim it to your liking at this point.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're selling it for stupid cheap a
pound and just hustle and wait to get it
[SPEAKER_06]: out, don't trim it worth a shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why cheap weed is cheap.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want connoisseur grade wheat,
take your time and trim it and wear rubber
[SPEAKER_06]: gloves.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, please.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to smoke all your skin.
[SPEAKER_06]: If your weed's that sticky, then
definitely wear rubber gloves.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then have something to be proud of.
[SPEAKER_06]: Adam loves the finger hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're wearing good rubber gloves,
you can like rub... You'll learn how to...
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't scrape the fucking latex right out
of that shit, but you'll learn how to rub
[SPEAKER_06]: the hash off of your fingers and make like
little hash ball or a little hash thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Watch a video on making a... What was it
called?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I'm talking about?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't because you're saying it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the hand hash one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Charis.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Watch a video on how to make Charis and
you'll figure out real quick.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the buds are pretty much dry,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got them in the room.
[SPEAKER_06]: They hung.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're crispy now.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're hand trimming them.
[SPEAKER_06]: So cut off like you got a bunch of sticks
in a band and take that fucking stick.
[SPEAKER_06]: You cut off little individual buds and you
just knock the leaves off with your
[SPEAKER_06]: thumbs.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can use scissors now if you want,
but it's kind of pointless.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am faster just thumbing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like you're playing Nintendo with
a bud in your hand.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're like just going up it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It should just take you a couple seconds
to get each bud.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can see, like I said, you can see
the finished result.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's really cool is if you wet trim,
you got to trim it and you're all sticky
[SPEAKER_06]: and it fucks up your scissors and it takes
so long.
[SPEAKER_06]: And every time you set a bud down or touch
a bud, it's fucking sticky there and
[SPEAKER_06]: stickier and sticky here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dry trimming is way cleaner.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this may sound weird, but as soon as
you're done trimming, you can weigh your
[SPEAKER_06]: shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is how much I have.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's done at that point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would the leaves not pull out moisture
anyways?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're essentially... Yeah,
it's ideal to leave them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they're ducks for the place.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're what's struggling to suck up the
moisture, not the bud really, I would
[SPEAKER_05]: imagine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's mostly right, but also it
helps slow it down because you want the
[SPEAKER_06]: water to leave more slowly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: And because that lets the chlorophyll
evaporates with the water.
[SPEAKER_06]: So once the water's gone, you can't take
away any more chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you let the water come out slowly,
then that chlorophyll dissolves with the
[SPEAKER_06]: water and goes away.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it happens in the cure process also.
[SPEAKER_06]: The gases start converting.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're getting into cure.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's different.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go there later.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can tell you now, like most of the
videos that I've seen... I made it an hour
[SPEAKER_06]: and I'm high as shit on that edible.
[SPEAKER_06]: It only took like 45 minutes to kick in.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a little better now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've calmed down, but for a minute there,
I was really high.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your hands are still like on your chair.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're holding yourself to your seat right
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll tell me you're a little better.
[SPEAKER_06]: Guys, seriously, if you are not an
experienced and don't try to be cool
[SPEAKER_06]: because I smoke a lot of dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll be that lady from NBC or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll be writing a story about freaking
out.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you'll piss your pants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't eat 350 milligrams unless you're
experienced because you will piss your
[SPEAKER_06]: pants.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm being a bad example on my own podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you said, you're an experienced dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're in the comfortable ability of your
own home.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got a homie here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're in the perfect spot to do this,
to be like, I'm going to... This is no
[SPEAKER_06]: different than drinking a bottle of
tequila.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to drive.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_06]: I may troll the internet a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Until your spelling goes and then it's
going to be like, who the hell is this
[SPEAKER_06]: asshole?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's about the most trouble I'm going to
be tonight.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_06]: So did we get through trimming weed
because I'm high?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you did.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I always say, are we done trimming
weed?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's your worst part.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can tell how many times a grower or a
person in the trim circle has been around
[SPEAKER_06]: pot by how fucking eager they are to trim.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're like, are we going to trim
tonight?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so excited.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's trim.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like your second, third, maybe fourth
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're like, hey, I got to fucking trim
a bunch of weed tonight.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're an experienced grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've had a couple of crops down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I still love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it and hate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it because I get to finally check
out my babies.
[SPEAKER_06]: I get to see like, oh, here we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get to fucking take those pretty flowers
and blast them into shatter.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_06]: I get to take all that trim and make
shatter.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's one cool thing about dry trim.
[SPEAKER_06]: As soon as you're done dry trimming,
you can haul that trim off over to your
[SPEAKER_06]: extract artist guy and you can do his
thing with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've cured trim before and blasted it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very, very unnoticeably different.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Couldn't tell the difference between
batches.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people say that's not the difference.
[SPEAKER_06]: If your weed's good, you...
[SPEAKER_06]: I cut down crops really if I'm making hash
out of the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes we'll run Girl Scout Cookies
whole plants and just make dabs out of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll cut it down a little bit early.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a little bit early.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to take it 63 days usually.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll cut it down to like 55, 56,
right at the end of eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a mocha frappuccino.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got that dirt coffee chocolate taste
in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Girl Scout Cookies hash, you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, let's put some music in the
background again.
[SPEAKER_06]: I turned it down to give that grow lesson
and talk and it disappeared.
[SPEAKER_06]: It disappeared forever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Guys, if you got more questions about dry
trimming weed, please let me know because
[SPEAKER_06]: I seriously am fucking high as fuck off
that edible.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you looking around for,
bro?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just making sure we covered
everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just helping you help you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like you helping me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for helping me help myself
because you make a good copilot tonight.
[SPEAKER_06]: At this point we have.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to the little trim girl that
came over.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wrote that down.
[SPEAKER_06]: I might've said that earlier.
[SPEAKER_06]: You did, but it's all good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, she helped trim, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: She saved hours of the night.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a good song.
[SPEAKER_06]: This song makes me think of Addison Demora
fucking singing it one time.
[SPEAKER_06]: He knew like every, at the one point where
it was, he like.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're running video of this, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm not running any video.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a shame.
[SPEAKER_06]: No?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, yeah, it's definitely a shame.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a little lit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never been this high on the podcast
before.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you feel like you could derail at any
moment?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to freak out or nothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm just high.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you feel like you've died and nobody
will tell you?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but I do want to like take my mic off
the stand and stand up and dance around.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what you look like.
[SPEAKER_06]: You really.
[SPEAKER_06]: If there was a concert right now,
I would be front row and my hands would be
[SPEAKER_06]: up in the air.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, yeah, I'd be screaming.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm ready, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Too bad it's dark time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if everyone's in bed and shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry that everybody's so
disappointing.
[SPEAKER_06]: This will be coming out on a Monday
morning and everyone's going to be like,
[SPEAKER_06]: what's wrong with him?
[SPEAKER_06]: He's all fucking sloppy today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to sloppy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been an hour, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: What else do you want to cover?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, guys, if I fucked up the grow
tip, please, please let me know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I've said wrong shit before.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like I said, I'll fix it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll try to tell you the right stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not about correcting you.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just about people not getting the
wrong information.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I want you guys to do it right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because like I said, I'm the captain of
this pirate ship.
[SPEAKER_05]: The people that know you in real life,
they know.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just laugh that shit off.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we know.
[SPEAKER_06]: He ate 350 milligrams and took like 72
dabs today.
[SPEAKER_05]: With an I Heart Dab shirt on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am wearing an I Heart Dab shirt.
Boom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not yet?
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to take some more dabs?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're probably.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's take another dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's probably just enough for two dabs
of live resin on this little piece of
[SPEAKER_06]: parchment right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel bad for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're smoking up all your live resins.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no, that's what it's for, is to take
dabs out.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, all right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't do any good sitting on a piece
of parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to, as somebody else sitting
here at the table, I want to share the
[SPEAKER_05]: wealth and like, goodness man.
[SPEAKER_05]: You contributed to a hell of a podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your close friends definitely deserve.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anybody out there listening to that is
one of you folks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now let's skip this song.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a little skit.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't need to listen to a skit on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awkward.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Torch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're running out of butane.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to have to switch to the
e-nail pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: You came prepared though.
[SPEAKER_06]: I came.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got the e-nail sitting on the table
right here with the highly educated
[SPEAKER_06]: infinity nail rigged up, ready to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's impressive, to say the least.
[SPEAKER_05]: The e-nail?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only the second time I've seen it,
but from the South, we don't have no fancy
[SPEAKER_05]: shit like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had the bong.
[SPEAKER_05]: You mean electricity?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No disrespect to the South, only Adam.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Completely me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just Adam and his trailer park in that
small town.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got it enough for everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: The railroad tracks behind his trailer
park.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now this is the power plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that why you're kind of mutated?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's debilitating is what it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you get any government grants from any
of that shit?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, they just want to like do a
bunch of studies and
[SPEAKER_05]: research.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, I've had the bong for the
past 10 years or so.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody would come around to smoke my
dual chamber water ice cooled bong.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never seen it.
[SPEAKER_05]: How much did you pay for that?
[SPEAKER_05]: $400?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of the people that are coming here
to buy the rec weed are straight up from
[SPEAKER_06]: the South.
[SPEAKER_06]: They drive all the way out here on a
weekend.
[SPEAKER_06]: Texas or Florida.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the same damn thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm telling you right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Imagine driving from fucking Florida.
[SPEAKER_06]: To Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now there's medical and shit in other
states.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but you can't go there and get it as
easily.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you have to prove residency,
you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're in, sorry, I'm totally
interrupting you because I'm high and
[SPEAKER_06]: rude.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're in Pueblo, Colorado and you're
on the very South end of Pueblo at mile
[SPEAKER_06]: marker exit 91, hit that exit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then as you come off the exit,
you need to go North just a little bit
[SPEAKER_06]: from the exit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there is the greener side dispensary.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a certain time period in the
early evening, right as the sun sets,
[SPEAKER_06]: the LED UFO lights come on in the
greenhouse to keep the plants from
[SPEAKER_06]: flowering early in the bloom season.
[SPEAKER_06]: From about a mile and a half away,
this fucking 120 by 30 foot greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it is, illuminates this purple
blue spectrum.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you don't know what it is,
it is the craziest looking fucking thing
[SPEAKER_06]: ever, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was all lit up last night when I was
out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just driving past, but I was on
I-25.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you look over, you're like,
what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like aliens are landing,
bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be a cool thing to like
fucking, really fucking wreck her and take
[SPEAKER_06]: her out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: What the fuck is that?
[SPEAKER_06]: So just go to the greener side dispensary
and buy yourself fucking recreational
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're open until like 11 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can go out there around 7,
7.30 and buy, I don't recommend that,
[SPEAKER_06]: but yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could probably call them and ask them
what time the UFO lights come on and tell
[SPEAKER_06]: them that you want to come check out the
purple greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they'll probably tell you what time
those turn off because they change,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, it's a greenhouse, so the
schedule is going to change.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just trying to do it to keep the
plants from going into flower early.
Come visit.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're fun people.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's tons of fun stuff to do here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got a frisbee golf park.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Disc golf.
[SPEAKER_06]: Disc golf.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you any good?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never played.
[SPEAKER_06]: Never mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: I miss a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I went out there and got really high.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty much the point.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty much the point.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chase the frisbee and fucking smoke some
balls in the park.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were like, dude, if you just bring a
couple of joints, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I went out there and I was like,
I got joints.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're like, nah, dude, we don't,
we don't want your weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, I don't blame you.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a lot better weeds than I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who were these guys?
[SPEAKER_06]: Back in fucking Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tennessee stoners.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like everybody had better weed than
you in Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody had better weed than me in
Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Loke.
[SPEAKER_06]: And your shitty weed for years and years.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Tennessee?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's like 50 guys in Tennessee going,
yeah, you just gave me a shout out.
No.
[SPEAKER_06]: No?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you take a dab or did I just take one
and be stingy?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't fucking know.
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's something left here,
that means I didn't share it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's a little left here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even see you take one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I took it, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's dead.
[SPEAKER_05]: You put it down like it was nothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I took a dab because the dabber is
clean.
[SPEAKER_06]: I must have.
[SPEAKER_06]: You sure you didn't just like drop off?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like 137% sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a big percent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if that exists.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some accountant out there pulling
his hair out right now going, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't have 137%.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then again, they don't come to the
agricultural podcast for statistics.
[SPEAKER_06]: They haven't seen how many grams per watt
I pull.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, keep listening to the podcast and you
might grow yourself and find out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Grams per watt.
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard this girl say, uh, she can pull
two plus pounds of Kong per thousand watt
[SPEAKER_06]: light.
[SPEAKER_06]: She was using a four by eight,
uh, fucking botanic hair trays on tables,
[SPEAKER_06]: like elevated, uh, with fucking lights,
every five thousand watt lights,
[SPEAKER_06]: every five feet and rows of five lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's a lot of details for this
chick's room, but she was claiming that
[SPEAKER_06]: she, and I'm not doubting her,
but she was saying that she pulls fucking
[SPEAKER_06]: two plus pounds of Kong per fucking cycle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to be funny, a lot of details would
have been like address when she's going to
[SPEAKER_06]: be there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a fucking, that's a fat pull if
she's doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Props.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, but then again, coming from East and
just watching videos, the only place you
[SPEAKER_05]: can watch videos of that nature,
forums and YouTube and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people sometimes exaggerate and
I'm not saying she is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen some pictures that may,
that may do her justice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see pictures.
[SPEAKER_05]: You may have just eyes.
[SPEAKER_05]: She needs to send me the dick pics.
[SPEAKER_05]: You mean of the dick plants?
[SPEAKER_05]: Not like actually some dick pics?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because this is the internet age.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you go on a podcast saying someone
needs to send me some dick pics,
[SPEAKER_06]: like within fucking 44 seconds of this
being released, your Twitter is going to
[SPEAKER_06]: go blip blip blip blip blip and you're
going to get dick pics.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll ask for followers.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll ask for support for your family
with cancer and people will ignore you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You ask for a dick pic on a podcast and
fucking everybody in America is going to
[SPEAKER_06]: flash you a dick pic.
[SPEAKER_05]: You let me ask for what I want to ask for,
okay?
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as you fucking clearly give your
fucking Twitter address.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm retweeting everything to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Guys, if you're checking out the
iGrowCulture podcast, Twitter,
[SPEAKER_06]: please refrain from the cock pics.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, refrain.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like pictures of fat buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go home and I'll make my wife a
Twitter account and you can send her cock
[SPEAKER_05]: pics.
[SPEAKER_06]: She likes the penis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty sure that's the first, she likes
the penis reference on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm surprised it wasn't from Wade.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a pretty dope task rock song.
[SPEAKER_06]: It bumps.
[SPEAKER_06]: It gets going.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it time to end the podcast?
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been going at it for an hour and 13
minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got anything cool to say?
[SPEAKER_06]: Your podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: You wanted to hang out and do a random
episode, so I wanted to fucking kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: roll with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to know if we got enough random in.
[SPEAKER_06]: It feels random.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like I fucked up a grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_06]: People count on me and I'm super high,
so ask for details.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what do we do after we fucking got the
leaves?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I want to get into curing
yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to talk about that when I'm not
wrecked.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to write that down and
fucking in two or three episodes from now,
[SPEAKER_06]: guess what we'll do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Curing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cure some weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we went way out of order because
we're only in veg and that actual lessons,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I was trimming weed tonight,
so it was crispy in my brain.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people don't even know.
[SPEAKER_06]: They literally think you dry it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's got to get cured a little bit
from now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're sending it out of town,
you just fucking do it, but if you're
[SPEAKER_06]: going to smoke yourself or with your
homies or use it for medical purposes,
[SPEAKER_06]: we got to cure it right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to be proud of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_06]: That edible is bubbling up in my stomach.
[SPEAKER_06]: It made me burp all kinds and it tastes
like fucking weed and fucking peanut
[SPEAKER_06]: butter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's end this podcast up while we're
still all sane.
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, I ate 350 milligrams of
cannabis edibles and I'm okay,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I don't recommend that you do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't advocate that type of use.
[SPEAKER_06]: I recommend this package has 50
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to say start with 25 or 50
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_06]: To be technical, I dared you to do it,
so it's a dare.
[SPEAKER_06]: You had to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I fucking would have done it without your
dare.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to eat a lot of edibles.
[SPEAKER_06]: This thing got me high.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It comes in waves.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it worth $11?
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.
[SPEAKER_06]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_06]: See, that's hard to say because some
people like their spending habits are
[SPEAKER_06]: different.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like where you choose to put your money.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can understand that.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a weird rant, but my mom will say
everything is expensive.
[SPEAKER_06]: How much is it?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's two pennies.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so expensive because she's from back
in the day when that was a quarter of a
[SPEAKER_06]: penny.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now she just sees it as, oh my God.
[SPEAKER_06]: For me, that was well worth $11 is my
fucking really short answer of a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: long words.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying usually things on that
level are a lot more.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, an edible is 10 to 15 bucks,
maybe 20 bucks for something really
[SPEAKER_06]: expensive, but if you're going to a
concert or something and you want to get
[SPEAKER_06]: fucking high as fuck and not have to worry
about smoking through it, because that's
[SPEAKER_06]: why I like edibles.
[SPEAKER_06]: I go to a comedy show and you can't smoke
at the ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_06]: They will throw you the fuck out and
you're highly visible in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That place is tiny.
[SPEAKER_06]: So eat a fat edible and just sit in there
and grin like a tard the whole night.
[SPEAKER_06]: This would be beautiful for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone likes to say pregame.
[SPEAKER_06]: Eat it about fucking north end of Denver
if you're driving up from Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking eat that fucker.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop and get gas at that one gas station.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like 196 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Eat that fucker in the parking lot and
then get back on the road.
[SPEAKER_06]: And by the time you get to ComedyWorks,
you'll have a smile on your face.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or wherever you're going in Denver,
you know, that's just my... But this was,
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah, it was worth 11 bucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're going to... I was going to
go, at least I want to go up there and get
[SPEAKER_06]: some weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: That $11 included tax.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Their dispensary includes tax.
[SPEAKER_06]: So 11 bucks flat out the door.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is great.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're like fucking vegan or something,
I don't know what their option is for you
[SPEAKER_06]: because it's super chocolatey.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're diabetic, you're going to
have to be careful with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But of course you're not supposed to eat
seven doses all at once like I did.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's got me rambling.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything in moderation.
I guess.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go big or go home on the agriculture
podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really want to thank you guys for
listening to me ramble.
[SPEAKER_06]: I ain't the fucking edible.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to go find something super
entertaining to do with myself now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once again, thanks to all the sponsors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks to Natural Mystic Cannabis
Caregivers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big high five across the table to Adam for
coming and doing a fucking hour and a half
[SPEAKER_06]: long podcast with me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's quite entertaining.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry for dragging it on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking if you're having fun, they're
having fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm having fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got TaskRock in my right ear.
[SPEAKER_06]: Quite loud.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not as loud as everybody else hears
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got it bumped up a little more on my
headphones.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got it going on over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But guys, go leave some comments.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know that I love fucking comments on
Facebook, on iTunes, on Twitter,
[SPEAKER_06]: on Instagram, on Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't read any comments this time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even check to see if they were
there.

[SPEAKER_06]: Much respect to all the sponsors that make
this show possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really appreciate you guys for listening
and supporting the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys might remember I ate a
350-milligram edible on an episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I've got a little bit of news that I
just found.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me scroll to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I got it right here on this page.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually going to drop the music out.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little distracting for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once again, shout out to Nika T for
letting me play the music.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me tell you the name of the song that
we're listening to.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the summer turn-up 2014 electric
dance hall music volume one live on DJ
[SPEAKER_06]: Nika T's SoundCloud page.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a fucking sweet shot of DJ Nika T
DJing at Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_06]: He looks stylish in that shot,
brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: Much respect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for letting me play your stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's get down to this news article.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_06]: My voice is, of course, Raspi from Dabin.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's par for the course, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So it says, tougher rules on Colorado
marijuana edibles for serving size and
[SPEAKER_06]: child safety.
[SPEAKER_06]: This article is by Eric Gorski from the
Denver Post.
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, Colorado's recreational marijuana
edible manufacturers face tougher rules on
[SPEAKER_06]: potency, serving size, and packaging of
their products under stopgap rules adopted
[SPEAKER_06]: by state regulators Thursday.
[SPEAKER_06]: The new guidelines crafted in response to
concerns about overconsumption by
[SPEAKER_06]: inexperienced consumers will do away with
bite-sized products that pack in 100
[SPEAKER_06]: milligrams of the psychoactive chemical
THC, the maximum allowed by state law.
[SPEAKER_06]: Products may contain up to 100 milligrams
of THC, but they must be easily broken off
[SPEAKER_06]: into pieces that have 10 milligrams or
fewer, the standardized edible serving
[SPEAKER_06]: size under state law.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now we've standardized, apparently,
10 milligrams as a serving of edible
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you buy 100 milligram bar,
they want it easily divisible in 10
[SPEAKER_06]: pieces.
[SPEAKER_06]: I shouldn't say names of products,
but you know how a KitKat is already kind
[SPEAKER_06]: of separated into servings?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of how I see they could do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And sorry, KitKat, that I used you,
but your serving shit is perfect for my
[SPEAKER_06]: example.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our Hershey's bar has got, they're already
divided perfectly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what they're going to require of
all of these pieces.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I got to say that, that edible that I
ate on the show was 350 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was small.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to measure it in my head to
give, to have something to compare it to,
[SPEAKER_06]: but it was quite tiny.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, I don't have anything in my range
that is about the same size.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was about the size of the top of a pill
bottle cap, like that cap on your pill
[SPEAKER_06]: bottle.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was about that big, like an inch and a
half by an inch and a half, and it was
[SPEAKER_06]: slightly thick.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the thing was, there was no way to
judge.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could break it in half, I guess,
and kind of eyeball it, but there was no
[SPEAKER_06]: way to really judge the size of that sort
of an edible.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're going to make it to where they
have to be easily broken up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that way you eat 10 milligrams
instead of trying to guess instead of
[SPEAKER_06]: getting wrecked.
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, in another change,
manufacturers will be required to put
[SPEAKER_06]: single serving edibles and child resistant
packaging before shipping them to stores
[SPEAKER_06]: instead of relying on stores to provide
the packaging as customers leave with
[SPEAKER_06]: their purchases.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that means more costs also
that's going to go up because the
[SPEAKER_06]: manufacturer now has to pay for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that's just going to get moved
right on down the line to the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's going to get pushed right on
down the line to you because now you're
[SPEAKER_06]: able to bring in, they give you this big
white, it looks like a money envelope,
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of like a bank bag, but it's got a
child resistant zipper thing on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's got like a clasp on the zipper that
you have to know how to open.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you bring that, you can put all of
your edibles and stuff in there and they
[SPEAKER_06]: let that count as your childproof
container.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you actually, you can buy those or
they charge you for them at a lot of the
[SPEAKER_06]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're just going to go put that right
on the product already.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to pay a little more,
but I guess a couple of bucks to keep kids
[SPEAKER_06]: safe is what we got to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you get into the argument of what
about parenting?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not all about the products.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about the parenting, but that's
another argument.
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably a whole other podcast that talks
about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the rules, this one says, the rules,
which still must be made permanent in a
[SPEAKER_06]: process that will include public comment,
will go into effect November 1st.
[SPEAKER_06]: They grew out of meetings with health
officials, regulators, industry
[SPEAKER_06]: representatives, and activists on both
sides.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Marijuana Enforcement Division's
primary concern is to ensure public
[SPEAKER_06]: safety, Atrice Bryant, a spokeswoman for
the Department of Revenue wrote in an
[SPEAKER_06]: email.
[SPEAKER_06]: Marijuana Enforcement Division feels that
clear serving size requirements within the
[SPEAKER_06]: industry is a vital part of responsible
regulation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rachel O'Brien, a founding member of Smart
Colorado, which supports tighter
[SPEAKER_06]: restrictions on marijuana, said the rules
are a step in the right direction,
[SPEAKER_06]: but time will tell whether they go far
enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: Edibles manufacturers responding to public
demand already shifted to lower potency
[SPEAKER_06]: edibles since recreational sales began
January 1st, said Mike Elliott,
[SPEAKER_06]: executive director of the Marijuana
Industry Group.
[SPEAKER_06]: The free market has largely addressed this
problem, he said.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I kind of agree that 350 milligram
edible that I ate, it fucked me up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm a professional pot smoker.
[SPEAKER_06]: I take dabs all day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wake and bake on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not bragging about how much I smoke or
anything, but I get down.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm smoking live resin right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I probably took a couple of half gram dabs
today.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that edible wrecked me.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if somebody, if a normal civilian got a
hold of that thing and ate the whole
[SPEAKER_06]: thing, they'd be destroyed and they would
have a miserable experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think clearly marking it is key.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: We all remember the story of the lady from
New York, Maureen O'Dowd, that ate too
[SPEAKER_06]: much edibles and thought she was fucking
turning herself inside out and dying in
[SPEAKER_06]: her hotel room.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody wants to be that guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well guys, I think that's enough news for
the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just kind of wanted to read you that one
article.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesse came over.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did a little outdoor grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like my voice is about to blow out
anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to turn up the music and then
we'll be back with the grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hang on for just one second.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, if you got a dabber, if you got a
joint, if you got a bowl, if you got an
[SPEAKER_06]: edible, if you've got a drinkable,
if you've got some topical, hey,
[SPEAKER_06]: consume that at this time, because I'm
going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that means that kind of technically we
are getting high together.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when this music starts, count to about
30, and that means we're getting high
[SPEAKER_06]: together right about then.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got the nail hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got your bowl packed.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got a joint rolled.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got something going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get stoned together.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm taking a dab of some Girl Scout
Cookies live resin made by a close friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to hit a Hitman mini cake with
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Highly educated.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the Infiniti nail hooked up to an
e-nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the old Temp Temple because at one
point I had arranged a sponsorship deal or
[SPEAKER_06]: something with the Temp Temple,
but they've since sold the company.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've got the Temp Temple.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's set at 460.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just about right, I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've also got a highly educated
titanium carb cap.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to drop the dab onto the nail
and then pop the carb cap on.
[SPEAKER_06]: So get high with me, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.
All
[SPEAKER_06]: right.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be right back in just a second with
Jesse's outdoor grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yo, what's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome back to the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I've got Jesse back.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to do another grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_06]: Before we do that, man, I want to say
congratulations on the air.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesse just got married.
[SPEAKER_06]: His wedding was awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure you've heard his talk about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So welcome to the show and
congratulations, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You look like a new man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your hair is halfway combed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got a big old smile on your face.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got a haircut, groomed the beard a little.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't going to mention the grooming of
the beard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you have to get refitted for your
dress after they groomed your beard?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, because it still stayed in place.
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: His beard is manly as fuck, you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you'll let me post a picture of him,
we'll put a picture up on the Instagram or
[SPEAKER_06]: somewhere so you guys can see what a man
beard looks like.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Colorado man beard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Turn myself up a little.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not loud enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, it's an ego thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to come up more on the computer
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Jesse is a part of the high grow store.
[SPEAKER_06]: His wife works there.
[SPEAKER_06]: How involved are you?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you an employee or are you just kind
of helping in behind the scenes?
[SPEAKER_08]: I am helping behind the scenes,
helping with training employees on product
[SPEAKER_08]: lines and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm also doing commercial sales for
dispensaries, caregiver grows,
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So get at me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll beat anyone's price.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an ego thing, speaking of egos.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pushing the mic closer to his face so
you guys can hear him a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll turn me down and him up.
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll make this happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: So speaking of high grow, a couple of
people that have been listening to the
[SPEAKER_06]: podcast kind of called us out.
[SPEAKER_06]: They said 550 bucks for a tote of soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I go online, that's only $299.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did some research.
[SPEAKER_06]: The caveat is if you pay $299,
shipping is $249 because it's got to be
[SPEAKER_06]: shipped on a FedEx truck.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were just talking about how big a tote
of soil is.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about the size of a Volkswagen.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably three and a half,
four feet wide by three and a half to four
[SPEAKER_06]: feet tall, depending on how much it's been
compressed because it is going to be kind
[SPEAKER_06]: of squished down by gravity and being
moved around.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're heavy as shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do they get that off the truck when
they bring it to your house?
[SPEAKER_08]: With a pallet jack.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right to your front yard.
[SPEAKER_08]: So figure it out from there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Know where it's going to go when they get
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe you can sweet talk the guy into
getting it there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this show is brought to you by Hygril
Indoor Growing Supplies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure you check out Hygril.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty sure I already said that once
in the show, but I like giving them love
[SPEAKER_06]: because they give us a lot of love.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesse's back.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's going to give us a grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_06]: We should review a little bit of what
we've done.
[SPEAKER_06]: By now we should have some big ass bushes
that are in the veg stage, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've talked a little bit about feeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've talked about top dressing a little
tiny bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to talk more about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're about to start the bloom phase and
the stretch phase.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we want to top them and do some
training, now is kind of our last chance.
[SPEAKER_06]: We should stop topping by now,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless we've got plants that are going to
clear the fence.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless height's a concern and that's your
motivation for topping.
[SPEAKER_08]: In that case, by all means, do what you
need to do to get your crop in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want the neighbors seeing that
shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want the people walking down the
street to see that shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you don't have to do it,
we can pull the plants down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have been taking care of it,
you should be able to grab some branches,
[SPEAKER_06]: the tall ones, and just pull them down and
then maybe tie them to a stake or maybe
[SPEAKER_06]: tie them to something in the garden that's
already there, like a rock or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can use a stake in the ground.
[SPEAKER_06]: I use big bamboo poles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just spread that plant out to where
instead of growing straight up,
[SPEAKER_06]: you kind of got it growing a little
horizontally.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now's your time to get it going.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I think within the next 10 days
here, everyone's going to go into flower
[SPEAKER_06]: real heavily.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I believe so.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got a strain that's Tom Hill's deep
chunk crossed with a G13.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I fixed that noise, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't find it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I fixed all that noise.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just noticed it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got a strain that's got some kind of
land-raised stuff in it and it has started
[SPEAKER_08]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_08]: It actually snuck up on me and I had to
take clones that are kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: pre-flowering.
[SPEAKER_06]: So guys, that's one thing we're going to
talk about.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get clones.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you've got some outdoor plants and
you're waiting for them to go in flower
[SPEAKER_06]: and you need some clones from them so you
can grow next year, get clones now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I always say, and this is I'm going to go
off on a little side rant here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I warned Jesse there'd be a rant about
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're growing from seed or a clone
that is brand new to you, take some clones
[SPEAKER_06]: before you go into flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really frustrating when you grow a
plant and it's done and you smoke it with
[SPEAKER_06]: some of your friends and they're like,
what the hell is this?
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're like, it's the best and you all
agree.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they go, I can't wait till you grow it
even better next time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you go, oh yeah, I don't have a clone
of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're never going to get to taste this
ever again except this one round.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the most frustrating, heartbreaking
feeling.
[SPEAKER_06]: So take clones, you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely take clones from everything
that you grow if you've got the option.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's some killer advice from a seed
company owner.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, I'd want you to buy more
seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: But what if you find that keeper?
[SPEAKER_06]: What if you get that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or how about when you do get that black
check?
[SPEAKER_06]: Harvest heavy, it tastes dank.
[SPEAKER_06]: It fucking gets you high as hell.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to wish you had a clone of
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish you had a clone of it too,
because I want to cut when I find you at
[SPEAKER_06]: the cannabis club or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need a clone of that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: So get some clones all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad you mentioned the seed company
thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's sound advice right there if I'm a
seed guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, we're talking about getting those
plants below the fence line.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can do the low stress technique.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can do a little bit of super cropping
like Soma does, kind of crack them and
[SPEAKER_06]: bend them a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now's your last chance, really,
because you're going into flower in about
[SPEAKER_06]: 10 days.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I really don't like to mess with
plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are hormones in your plants,
oxens and cytokinins that move around
[SPEAKER_06]: with, they find the tops of the plants and
affect the top of the plant and the way
[SPEAKER_06]: that stuff grows.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want to disrupt that right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll freak your plants out a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, mess up bud sizes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but you can still kind of pull them
down and low stress training them,
[SPEAKER_06]: but you don't want to go and kick their
ass real bad or anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had one of my first seasons growing
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't top and all the plants were from
seed.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the main stock was just as straight as
could be.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I tied a rope around the top of the,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm turning and weaving on the microphone.
[SPEAKER_06]: They keep doing it too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesse brought over some live resin.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really high.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you got to like the live resin.
[SPEAKER_08]: Unicorn hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: The unicorn hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the ones you did from seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tied the rope around the top of the plant
and just pulled the whole fricking thing
[SPEAKER_08]: down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Almost made like a bow and arrow looking
thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the result was just like this whole
head road of buds.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was super cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: All the side branches took over and
started.
[SPEAKER_08]: They all went up as lateral tops.
[SPEAKER_08]: Talking about the hormones and stuff like
that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis wants one dominant top on the
plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something, I know what it is, but I'm not
going to, we'll go, I'm trying to go
[SPEAKER_06]: slowly with the listeners and get
everybody up to speed and not try to add
[SPEAKER_06]: Rosenthal people.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you talk to Ed, he forgets that we're
not all doctors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rocket scientist.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: A weed scientist and he'll just blow your
mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm trying to go slow for you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll talk about the oxygen and cytokinins
and the other hormones and plants that
[SPEAKER_06]: make them want to grow a top bud.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when you cut out that top bud,
all the other bottom buds go, Hey,
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like when you kill the, you kill the
leader, all the little tribesmen think
[SPEAKER_06]: that they could be the leader.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of what the top, the bottom
buds do.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you got that plant, pull it over
like a fishing pole would bend when you
[SPEAKER_06]: got a fish.
[SPEAKER_06]: All those little branches that you've got
those little sucker buds that oftentimes
[SPEAKER_06]: we cut off, those will create nice little
bud sites because now they're,
[SPEAKER_06]: they've got the chance to become a top and
they're also exposed to more light.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a real neat effect.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we should be in the stretch phase or
starting to pre flower, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, totally.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you doing anything for bugs now?
[SPEAKER_08]: I, I spray with Neem oil and I just did it
the last time.
[SPEAKER_08]: As soon as I noticed flower, I really
don't, especially outdoors.
[SPEAKER_08]: I really don't like spraying the plant
with anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so, uh, I stop, uh, the kelp mills,
compost tea sprays, um, and the Neem oil
[SPEAKER_08]: sprays.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I do that individually.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't, you know, just stop the whole
garden as each strain starts flowering.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, Oh, can't spray that plant
anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, um, so, uh, in Southern
Colorado, we're getting a lot of rain
[SPEAKER_08]: right now and there's some weird bugs
popping up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, yeah, little flying critters I've
never seen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Stuff's going to be out of balance.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I personally haven't noticed,
um, any, uh, you know, them being a
[SPEAKER_08]: predator plant predators, but,
um, it could be.
[SPEAKER_06]: So those things are going to look for
homes and they're going to lay eggs
[SPEAKER_06]: because they're normal homes for laying
eggs are going to be disrupted.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're going to have to go look under
your leaves and now if you find some shit,
[SPEAKER_06]: put on some gloves and just clean them out
of there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just clean that stuff out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to get, if you're a hippie,
you want to give those bugs a new home,
[SPEAKER_06]: feel free to re relocate them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck those bugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Throw them in the fucking burn.
[SPEAKER_08]: Feed them to the chickens.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I bet your chickens would love you for
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you dealing with all the rain?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it has been raining every day from
about six o'clock to nine o'clock for the
[SPEAKER_06]: past week until today when it was fucking
sweltering hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once again.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I keep my plants hollowed out.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, the foliage on the inside,
um, uh, there isn't really any,
[SPEAKER_08]: um, even in veg.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, especially as it gets later in veg.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but, uh, and you guys will learn what
I cut up your plants a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: That, that helps.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, the biggest thing the rain has been
doing to me is, uh, saving me from having
[SPEAKER_08]: to water my plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, my main outdoor gardens in a
depression.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, a couple of acres drain into it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, works out real nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Plenty of water for the plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have yet to be out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, we need to go on a short little
road trip.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just bought my dad as a first,
uh, dab rig.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Oh man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to meet your dad at the wedding.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was, I, I thought that was who he was.
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't introduce himself.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was loud.
[SPEAKER_06]: He just walked up, shook my hand,
nodded at me and gave me the, like a man
[SPEAKER_06]: handshake and a man nod, like you're
welcome.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he walked away and he didn't speak
because it was so loud at where we were.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't have heard him if he did speak.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, that's probably pops right
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm not certain.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he, uh, he beams this energy of you
fucking respect me.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just what comes off of him.
[SPEAKER_06]: You do respect me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't want to know what will happen
if I don't, because I have no intention,
[SPEAKER_06]: but, uh, he just looks like a man that
commands a little bit of respect.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: In his younger days, he was, um,
um, I've seen him do some stuff mortal man
[SPEAKER_08]: can't do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I watched him do immortal shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: He outdabbed and out drank everybody at
the fucking table where he was,
[SPEAKER_06]: and then stood up and called us youngsters
pussies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause we couldn't keep up.
[SPEAKER_06]: The guy's going to dab or what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like shit, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm falling out of my chair, dabbed out
over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I could use a dab then.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a good guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had fun though.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had fun with your, your whole family was
great.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your wedding will be talked about not only
on this podcast, but in Colorado for years
[SPEAKER_06]: to come.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I was shooting for.
[SPEAKER_06]: First dab bar in a Colorado wedding that
I'm aware of.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, it was funny the day after the
wedding, I saw, um, I still haven't gotten
[SPEAKER_08]: to read it, but the Washington poster,
the New York times had an article about,
[SPEAKER_08]: uh, marijuana being a welcome guest at a
Colorado and Washington, uh, weddings.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, damn, you're right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there were usually at weddings,
uh, and this is just a cliche thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's usually one fight and it's usually
like, a sisterly thing or some shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my God, I can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it just gets fucking stupid and
it's a drunk family member.
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't have that.
[SPEAKER_08]: We actually almost did, but I derailed it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, but yeah, no, that's, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, it was very chill and laid back.
[SPEAKER_06]: So good job to everybody for getting home
safely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I watched everybody at the end of the
night, uh, search for rides and all the
[SPEAKER_06]: people that were sober were kind enough to
get all you silly drunk fuckers home.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: We party hardy, but, uh, we did,
you know, try to be safe as possible.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, driving from there, you had to be
safe.
[SPEAKER_06]: There were cops everywhere as you came
back.
[SPEAKER_08]: No one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're talking about a grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're starting to bloom.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, do you guys know what you're looking
for when you're going into flower?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you looking for your males?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you looking for your females?
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, pretty soon?
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're growing outdoors near us,
I really hope so.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you know how to find those males.
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless it's on purpose and then right on.
[SPEAKER_06]: So quickly, if you're looking for females,
uh, it looks like they're growing a cotton
[SPEAKER_06]: ball when they start to flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like you're getting a dandelion
when they're making flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you've got, uh, some balls and
literally it looks like you're growing a
[SPEAKER_06]: little, little pack of bananas.
[SPEAKER_08]: They start green.
[SPEAKER_06]: They start green.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they turn into balls.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kill those plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless you're looking to make seeds and
piss off all your neighbors that grow weed
[SPEAKER_06]: and seed up all their crops, kill those
male plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, or yeah, just kill them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you have clones, uh, call me,
we'll see what kind of males you got and
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe we'll do some fun with those.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're looking for the, you want the
dandelion looking ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the easiest way to describe it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, we got to do, you guys got to
read some books.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you aren't familiar with males and
females, you got to catch up a little bit,
[SPEAKER_06]: do a little bit of reading.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of what a grower needs to
know.
[SPEAKER_06]: That shit you should be doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So identify the males, pull the males.
[SPEAKER_08]: And even feminize seeds, keep an eye on
them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's feminizing is not a 100% process.
[SPEAKER_06]: We say 99%, which, uh, still there's
problems happen when you're making,
[SPEAKER_06]: if you, if you use certain methods,
you're less likely to get FEMS.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you use certain methods,
then FEMS occur often.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen it at a big dispensary girl grew
out of like 250 feminize seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: They had like four males and they didn't
pay attention.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it all got wrecked and, uh,
the owner was quite pissed and you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: it was explained to them, you know,
99% do the math, 250 plants.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now he's got a problem with feminize
seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to push that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just want to, I want to make sure that
people hear you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dispensary owners, uh, in general,
don't like growing from seed.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the ones that do, uh, mad props to you
guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, man, you get such great shit when you
grow seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't know what you're going to find.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you don't have the clone that
everybody in your neighborhoods growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody around here right now has a damn
blue dream clone flow flow.
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I give out flow to new growers.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're like, I'm new and I need to
grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, try this flow cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually I think that's flow to cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really think that cut we have is
flow.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've always saw the exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've heard that story.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's somebody in Colorado that posted
on Facebook that they know that that's
[SPEAKER_06]: flow to cut and that they actually got
that cut from Ed Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're listening to this show,
please tweet me or Facebook me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, you can go to iRegenetics or
iGrowCulture on Facebook or Twitter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, please.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I want to know more about the cut of
flow that goes around Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, there's a cut called tangerine that is
not tangy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the tange.
[SPEAKER_08]: Man, that's so confusing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that is flow and Durbin poison.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_06]: If anybody in Colorado knows what I'm
talking about, it's not tangy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone calls it tange and they call it
the tange tange or the tang tang for a
[SPEAKER_06]: little while around here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty sure that's flow and Durbin
poison.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tang tang.
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember a big, uh, full, full spread
of, um, dispensary ad about that strain
[SPEAKER_08]: way back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody near the Fort Collins area made
that one is from what I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of, it's a problem with the
weed world because by the time I give you
[SPEAKER_06]: a clone, the story has changed and then
you give it to somebody else and the story
[SPEAKER_06]: has totally changed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they pass it on and now it's not
even the same strain and it's being
[SPEAKER_06]: hoarded or it's being hoarded out for way
too much money.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not being grown to its potential
because it's not being called what it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Patients are getting jacked.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're in the stretch phase.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're blooming.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're getting off track here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: They seem to like the listeners have
responded, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: They like it when I get all high and just
talk.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They like it when I kind of go off course.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I ate a big ass edible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh guys, I'm, I survived that edible.
[SPEAKER_06]: I, I gotta tell you, I felt like shit for
the whole next day though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, eating that whole edible really,
uh, took a toll on my body.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I'm getting old as part of what I'm
trying to say.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm 35 now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think when I was 25, I probably
could have done it and not felt like shit
[SPEAKER_06]: the next day, but I had to go get some
kombucha.
[SPEAKER_06]: And fucking eat a big fat meal.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to try to put myself back on track,
but no disrespect to that edible company.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was not supposed to eat all of it at
once.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I listened to that episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was high.
[SPEAKER_08]: You weren't, yeah, not at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: You weren't even supposed to eat half of
that once.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do they make the stuff so good though?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it was delicious too.
[SPEAKER_06]: If that was just like a restaurant dinner
or a restaurant dessert, I'd order that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need that peanut butter thing you serve.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put some ice cream with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be delicious.
[SPEAKER_06]: So since we're going into flower,
we're starting to stretch a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're looking for the males.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're looking for hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, if it's questionable, if it's weird,
keep a really good eye on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lower inner branches.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, that's a good spot to look for
hermies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where you don't get as much light.
[SPEAKER_08]: Straight on the top too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Top lead buds.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a common area too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, get those out of there.
[SPEAKER_06]: The males and the herms, get them out of
there, put them in the fire pit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I guess be careful when you're
throwing away your trash.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you live in a non-legal state,
that's something that I just want to throw
[SPEAKER_06]: out there for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just compost it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Compost it if you can.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or feed it to your chickens.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not all of us have a farm.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of us are city folk here.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's another, uh, there's another
podcast where one of the guys has
[SPEAKER_08]: chickens.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I shout those guys out so we could see
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Crunchy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Word.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up homie?
[SPEAKER_08]: What up bro?
[SPEAKER_06]: He cooked me dinner one time indirectly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was at an event or at a party where he
was the chef and he made dinner for
[SPEAKER_06]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: And props, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good cooking.
[SPEAKER_06]: He actually asked me about my diet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dietary needs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause he saw that I got dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_06]: He knew I was a Rasta.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rastas have strict dietary restrictions
and he was respectful to that and made a
[SPEAKER_06]: meal around what I can and cannot eat.
[SPEAKER_08]: I always do that when I barbecue with
vegetarian friends.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't know that yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you invited me and you assured me that
there would be vegetarian friendly food.
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So guys respect your vegetarian friends.
[SPEAKER_08]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't make fun of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just stupid.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hear people make fun of us.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is so stupid.
[SPEAKER_06]: We make fun of you back when you do it
because.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good.
[SPEAKER_08]: They deserve it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your colon's full of fucking rotten meat
and you're telling me I'm stupid for not
[SPEAKER_06]: eating it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We get even in our own ways.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you guys die.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, hey, no.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even know any good vegetarian
jokes.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you call a vegetarian with
diarrhea?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, that's a classic one.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only one I got for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's feed our ganja plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, we're going into bloom so we can
slowly decrease the nitrogen and increase
[SPEAKER_06]: the phosphorus and potassium.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, if you're top dressing, you can switch
your teas to the more phosphorus and
[SPEAKER_06]: potassium based teas.
[SPEAKER_08]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, if you're using the like granulated
products that they sell in the store,
[SPEAKER_06]: you can go ahead and switch to the bloom
version of those products.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you don't have to keep using that veg
stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, slowly switch that stuff though.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, still, well, I don't, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, assuming you've only applied it one or
two times, something like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, it makes it look, just make sure you
have nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause a lot of time those, uh,
products are pretty low on nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: On the bloom side.
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe, well, actually when I feed my
indoor plants, I don't switch the day that
[SPEAKER_06]: I put them into flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't just say they're in flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's cut out all the veg newts and go to
just my bloom schedule.
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of phase it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's like a two week period.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also keep my metal halide lights in
for about 14 to 21 days to keep them short
[SPEAKER_06]: and stocky.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when you switch them,
you really see them, they stay low and the
[SPEAKER_06]: butt's fat.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just slowly, I like to phase out my veg
into my bloom feed is what I think I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: trying to say.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but, uh, yeah, started out at Mexican
bat guano, um, Epsom salts.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're using that, um, it's a good time
to be a foliar, you know, one last foliar
[SPEAKER_08]: spray.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mexican or Jamaican bat guano.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just want to correct.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you said, I think some companies
have blended guano.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you want to high PK.
[SPEAKER_06]: So any alfalfa meal with this feed?
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I love that stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, yeah, I mean, it's a great time to
go ahead and top dress them in,
[SPEAKER_08]: um, alfalfa meal.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, you know, it's really accessible
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what else are you putting in your tea
right now?
[SPEAKER_06]: Some Jamaican guano.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an alfalfa meal.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, molasses, molasses all the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, some, uh, Rocky mountain earthworm,
uh, factory or some warm poop.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got the bomb stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't, uh, I'm kind of stoned.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't Rocky mountain.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, I don't remember the name of the
company.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's what it is.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you Google Rocky mountain worms,
you'll find what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had my own, uh, I've made my own warm
castings before and they didn't look as
[SPEAKER_08]: good as his dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, it's all about what you feed those
worms for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know he's got a real cool setup.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go check them out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Up in Springs.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a free shout out too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We do a lot of free shout outs.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good stuff though.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's community, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's community.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not all about business all the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, some Micos, uh, you know, there's
several different brands of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: OGT, great white shark.
[SPEAKER_06]: ZHL if you're using botanic hair.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, the orca stuff, liquid, um,
that's half dead.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never tried that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I always fear that liquids are going to
wreak havoc on the rest of my stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause you don't know what preservative
there is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the powders, you can sprinkle it right
near the root zone and see that it's on
[SPEAKER_08]: there and be happy with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: The OGT is available at high grow Pueblo
for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: That stuff's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I would recommend out of all
that you can, uh, I can see a difference
[SPEAKER_06]: when I feed my plants that within 24
hours, uh, the next light cycle,
[SPEAKER_06]: two light cycles later, I guess when they
come on, they're praying they're up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Straight up like, yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make them pray.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They, they love that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Should be their slogan.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's a OGT is the bomb.
[SPEAKER_06]: A great white shark is really good at
getting rid of soil based insects.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, uh, I've heard the grow Kashi does
same thing too.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're doing some experiments with that
right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, Jesse mentioned before we
recorded that he got some grow Kashi.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you guys aren't paying attention to the
grow Kashi, it's probiotics.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, big love to the Probiotic Farmers
Alliance.
[SPEAKER_06]: What up Gage Green and all the guys
running the Probiotic Farmers Alliance.
[SPEAKER_08]: Gage Green.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's key play.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, I don't know if I should use
Mike's real name, but what's up,
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike?
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, those guys are inspiring.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, people ask where I get a lot of my
inspiration and a lot of my ideas and
[SPEAKER_06]: shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, a lot of it currently comes from Gage.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's who I'm on now.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a time where it was all Soma,
of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know Soma.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had no idea what that was.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then a friend of mine was like,
you remind me of Soma.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I Googled it and I was like,
that could be my father's shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, then there was Subcool.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's racist.
[SPEAKER_08]: Say whoever told you that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it kind of is.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're both white and have dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, and it was all about the vibe.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was more about the vibe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, Soma talks about mimetics and I'm
really big on the mimetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll talk about more about that later.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the, it's like a, the vibes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Subcool always gets me going.
[SPEAKER_06]: Subcool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was into Subcool for a little while.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, not to be a hater.
[SPEAKER_06]: I lost interest when it got dramatic with
him and Miss Jill.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the weed nerd show.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's when I fell off.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where I lost interest.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, and then, uh, I've always been a big
fan of Jorge and Ed Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: All that stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I like reading.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's always gets me fired up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lately Gage Green has been one of the best
reader.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was a, I was a Cali connection fan boy
for a little while.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty decent friends with Swerve and
Adam Hill.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, he's got it going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's, that's a good seed company right
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: You work hard, you get paid good.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were kind enough to let us hang out
in their booth for 420 at the cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: On 420 at 420.
[SPEAKER_06]: So everyone else is crowded and chaotic
and I was sitting on a couch taking a dab
[SPEAKER_06]: with Adam Hill.
[SPEAKER_08]: So any, I was at the cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone who had a couch anywhere was
chilling.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a hot cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't wait for 420 again this year.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear big things are coming.
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought two years ago was crowded,
but it was more chaotic two years ago for
[SPEAKER_08]: sure though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that year when you couldn't walk
through.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was frustrating.
[SPEAKER_06]: That alley was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big shout out to the high times crew,
Danny Danko, Bobby Black, Nico.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to miss a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause there's a lot of you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Dan's guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to you guys for coming to
Colorado and doing a huge ass event.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys look like you're going fucking
crazy when you come here and do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're running around all chaotic.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Danny Danko will take time to talk to
you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I walked by and just kindly, I said,
free weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did the same thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he turned around and shook my hand and
talked to me and that was kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't need to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was busy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I interrupted him right in the middle of a
conversation.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, Hey, thanks for recording free
weed, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Danny, you haven't put out a podcast in
over a month.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need a new episode of free weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to fill your gap, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to fill your gap for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's gross.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm never going to say that to you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Feeling Danny Danko's gap.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a podcast called free weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hosted by Danny Danko and Mike
Hughes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a high times production.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sponsored by them in any way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just have respect for people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Danny Danko and the free weed podcast are
actually part of what inspired this show.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to do things my way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I kind of combined a lot of my
favorite people's shows and do my own
[SPEAKER_06]: thing here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have the agro-culture podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up, Mike Hughes too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: How I mentioned, I made sure to say Mike
Hughes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just making sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure he gets love.
[SPEAKER_08]: I always feel bad for Mike.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: He contributes heavily.
[SPEAKER_08]: It should be free weed with Danny and
Mike.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're Mr. Danny.
[SPEAKER_08]: You hear that guys?
[SPEAKER_08]: Just kidding.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just kidding.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll tag at Danny Danko in this episode.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if I follow Mike Hughes,
but we'll tag him also.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see if they can listen to this.
[SPEAKER_08]: You better hook me up with something,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give me a pack of raw papers.
[SPEAKER_06]: His name is Jesse Grose.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want to give a shout out,
it's Rasta Jeff and Jesse Grose.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I said your full name on the other
podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gotten to the point I don't really
give a shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried to keep my identity kind of
separate from the irie genetics,
[SPEAKER_06]: agro-culture stuff, but everybody knows
it's Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_06]: After the first cannabis cut, people took
pictures with me and they're like,
[SPEAKER_06]: look, I'm getting high with irie genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, well, they know I'm the
fucking ridiculously tall white guy with
[SPEAKER_06]: red blocks.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is game over.
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember when we first met, you told me
something about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then within like a few weeks,
you were like, whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Try to keep it on the down low,
man.
[SPEAKER_06]: After the cut, when I went and Subcool is
there with packs of seeds, seeds in his
[SPEAKER_06]: hand, like what's up, I'm Subcool,
here's seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, I don't have shit to worry
about.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like he doesn't even live in this state.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, changed my whole outlook on
things.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right guys, we've talked a little bit
about outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're starting to bloom.
[SPEAKER_06]: I told you how to find your males,
your hermaphrodites, get those out of
[SPEAKER_06]: there.
[SPEAKER_06]: We told you to cut clones, make sure you
cut clones.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want to grow some shit and then
be like, this is my best strain ever.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've done that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually grew a strain.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I even want to say the
name.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kevin, if you're listening, it was that,
that strain that you and Pops loved.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't get it to root.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those clones would not take roots for the
life of me.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it got away.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got another pack of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see if that works.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to stop topping, but you can super
crop and train your stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were talking about what Jesse puts in.
[SPEAKER_06]: I try to, he doesn't realize I'm trying to
fish out what he's putting in his tea.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause he doesn't like to tell us he
doesn't like to share all the info.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I slowly pry it out of him.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got molasses.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got alfalfa meal.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got guano.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got worm castings.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got Michael's.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you using any sort of sea kelp right
now?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kelp doctor Neptune stuff for like a
couple cups.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now it's flower time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a blood meal, bone meal, any of that
stuff yet?
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never put any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you don't like slaughterhouse
products.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, no, I use it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never put it in a T but top dressing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do have an issue with slaughterhouse
products, but I also have a, a shit ton of
[SPEAKER_08]: slaughterhouse products.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're a farmer and you understand,
you balance it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there's nothing wrong with blood
mills.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like where I, well, I mean,
I guess the argument could be made that
[SPEAKER_08]: there is something wrong with it,
but the biggest thing with commercial
[SPEAKER_08]: blood mills, we don't know where it came
from.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, those, or at least that's my
big issue with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And those caliber fed shit that I probably
highly disapprove of.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, and don't want to put into my
body.
[SPEAKER_06]: Part of why I'm a vegetarian is because
the way they treat cows.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no need to contribute to that.
[SPEAKER_08]: In my opinion, in general, I don't really
like eating beef.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and I can't stand ground beef.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one of the most disgusting things I
can, that's the most questionable meat.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate when I'm working and in a hurry and
yeah, as a farmer and a grower,
[SPEAKER_06]: are you bothered by like fast food joints
by seeing what people are eating?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, process, any kind of processed meat.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and I'm just as guilty of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I, I try hard when I get busy in life.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, you know, it's just, it's hard to cook
and it's easy to drive through,
[SPEAKER_08]: drive through.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, but yeah, that's, that's why this
country is so fat.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why we have cancer.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, yeah, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a huge issue with all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We paid people will pay top dollar for
their booze, pay top dollar for their
[SPEAKER_06]: herb, but then spend 99 cents on a fucking
cheeseburger.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Spend those bucks on yourself guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, cancer is expensive later.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just cook at home.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's good for relationships.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cook with friends, eat with friends,
eat with, you know, your wife,
[SPEAKER_08]: your girlfriend, your kids.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, you know, it's just good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cook with friends for relationships.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's sound advice from Jesse.
[SPEAKER_06]: You learned some shit on accident today.
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't think that was coming.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, we've done 30 minutes, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got anything else you want to add to
the grow lesson before we kind of start
[SPEAKER_06]: wrapping it up?
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, a little de-vegging, um, go ahead and
pull up the bottoms of the plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, so clip off any, uh, shave their legs,
shave their legs.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's make them sexy.
[SPEAKER_06]: All that bottom stuff is going to be crap
and larf and it's going to kind of take
[SPEAKER_06]: away from the top of your plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: So take that bottom, the little sucker
leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can tell what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's not making, and you can do this
all the way up to like three or four weeks
[SPEAKER_06]: into bloom.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just take off all that crap that is in the
way you'll know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if it doesn't look like it's going
to be a bud worth trimming, take it off.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't need to be there and throw it
away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't just throw it on the ground.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see a lot of you guys cut your leaves
off, throw them in the ground.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Reuse it in some way.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been, oh, mulching.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we'll throw up real quick.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and mulching up a little bit,
a little alfalfa, um, some old hay that we
[SPEAKER_08]: had laying around.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, actually I think it was straw,
but, um, whatever.
[SPEAKER_08]: All the city folk.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's the same shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, some compost, um, and, uh,
you know, it just helps hold water.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, it's getting into the hot time of
year.
[SPEAKER_08]: And normally, uh, we're monsoon season
right now, apparently, but, um,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, this other people in other parts
of the country, you know, this mulching up
[SPEAKER_08]: is good.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's also a great way to get rid of
all your green waste.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, you know, it's just a big old
cycle.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're, if you're juicing, uh,
you could juice your cannabis leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you haven't been spraying shit on them,
if you've put neem oil or some chemicals,
[SPEAKER_06]: do not do some, please don't.
[SPEAKER_06]: If your, uh, if your leaves are clean,
uh, go ahead and juice those and taste
[SPEAKER_06]: that up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're mulching now.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have taught us a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone's going to move to the country
and abandon the city and all move out to
[SPEAKER_06]: the middle of nowhere and just start these
organic, small, not even large scale,
[SPEAKER_06]: just small scale organic ganja farms.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have to do much.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, just do your part.
[SPEAKER_06]: Grow your own food, grow your own herb,
get some chickens, make your own eggs.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I don't eat eggs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I really try not to eat eggs.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you like, it's just not, that just
seems funky to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't eat.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if, uh, yeah, if I, it's kind of where
I'm headed, if I had chickens,
[SPEAKER_06]: bro, we'd eat eggs every day and go out
and get two or three eggs from the
[SPEAKER_06]: chickens and we'd do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like the, uh, your shirt you were in
there, uh, you know, that yellow is like
[SPEAKER_08]: grocery store yellow and the orange is
like what my eggs look like.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, that's probably 10 times the
nutrients in there and also the flavor.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have a flavor.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, you, you just think eggs have flavor
too, until you have good ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have a good farm, fresh eggs.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have my chickens in the city too.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have them at the farm too,
but I also have chickens in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can have chickens over there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know you could do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can have, uh, in Pueblo, you can have,
don't quote me on this, but I think it's
[SPEAKER_08]: six or seven.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, no encroachment.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, which means, you know, you can't build
it right next to your, your chicken pen
[SPEAKER_08]: right next to your fence.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, it's gotta be five feet from a
property line.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, no roosters.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, and they can't be a nuisance.
[SPEAKER_08]: Which, you know, it takes a while to
develop a nuisance.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have one that I'm about ready to kill.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't believe none of my neighbors have
called him.
[SPEAKER_08]: It wakes me up too early.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, you're next bitch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your name is dinner.
[SPEAKER_08]: Chicken noodle soup.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, once again, bro, congratulations.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll quit talking about the wedding on
the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was so much fun guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Talk about it so much parties.
[SPEAKER_06]: So congratulations to your wife also.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if she listens, but I hope
you do burn.
[SPEAKER_08]: Occasionally I forced her to show.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's laughs at me for listening to myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, you got to remember what you
said.
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't say anything silly on the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're getting really good at this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm looking forward to more episodes
because you're starting to get
[SPEAKER_06]: comfortable.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think you come back about two
or three weeks when we start kicking into
[SPEAKER_06]: flower?
[SPEAKER_08]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I'll give you a call as soon as like,
I guess I'm good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Budsets.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, sounds good to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: So guys, we're going to take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, go check out high grow Denver.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dot com I think is the website.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go look at that while we, uh, take some
dabs and I'll be back to wrap up the show
[SPEAKER_06]: in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude.

Jesse only give him a big shout out for
[SPEAKER_06]: coming out and taking some time out from
his garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got a farm.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got a family.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's newly married.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, take some little effort to get
over here and I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks a lot, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look forward to having you back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, coming up in a future episode,
I plan to have a little debate on,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, well, not a debate, but a discussion,
a friendly discussion on, uh, the classic
[SPEAKER_06]: question of clone versus seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also we'll have a little subtopic of
feminized versus regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of people are opposed to
feminize seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can talk a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Clear up some myths, give some people some
information.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll check it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's red rat in the song there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Turn that up for a minute.

autoflower seeds, but we did talk about

to the conversation with Jesse,
[SPEAKER_06]: Spence and myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, what's up, ladies and gentlemen,
we are back.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got my homie, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_06]: At Jesse Grose on Instagram and Twitter.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also we guys, at Jesse Grose on
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_06]: I looked for you, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's another person called Jesse Grose
on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, fuck that guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: How the hell is that even?
[SPEAKER_06]: Politely fuck that guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't even know him.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, actually I don't know him.
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be cool as shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be like your German clone or
something.
[SPEAKER_06]: Be just like you in Germany.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also with us over here on the microphone
is our buddy Spence.
[SPEAKER_06]: What up, Spence?
[SPEAKER_06]: What up, guys?
[SPEAKER_06]: Spence has got his microphone
strategically placed so that he can iPhone
[SPEAKER_06]: it up on the table.
[SPEAKER_06]: And talk.
[SPEAKER_06]: And talk at the same time.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got the elbows out.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's chilling it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have had some fat dabs today.
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you get me a dab of a minute ago?
[SPEAKER_06]: That live resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a Yeti OG.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I loved it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been smoking on that Yeti OG.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very much so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: How you guys doing today, man?
[SPEAKER_09]: Chilling.
[SPEAKER_09]: Excited to be here for another podcast,
you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: You told me what you did today.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: We won't talk about that on the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's hilarious shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man is getting his hustle on in ways you
never thought of.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesse dug fucking fence post holes all
day.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he's lively.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's over here hyper.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: He just took a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we all took fat dabs over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, maybe all of us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, Jesse did just take.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the largest dab I've ever seen
Jesse voluntarily take on his own.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen people give him a dab that big,
but I've never seen him dipping for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been practicing the last few weeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the music up for you guys?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Turned it down way solo.
[SPEAKER_06]: We couldn't hear it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we're here together and talk about
the subject at hand, which today I decided
[SPEAKER_06]: we want to talk about clones versus seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe we'll do a little bit of talking
about feminine seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we might talk a little bit briefly,
briefly about auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got one thing I wanted to mention in
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: This mix that I'm playing really has a lot
of volume jumps in the background.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I apologize that it's so jumpy.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're listening to DJ Nickatee in the
background again.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to give him a shout out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out, DJ Nickatee.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for letting me play your music.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: So everybody at this table is a pretty
damn experienced grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got I'd call myself a breeder.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesse's a Paul and Chucker, maybe a
breeder.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if he'd call himself a
breeder yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: More practice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Spence is a hell of a grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had some stuff tested and Spence has
tested higher than all of my stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he grew somebody else's strain.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you remember what the numbers were,
bro?
[SPEAKER_09]: Capelten was 20 percent.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a Girl Scout cookie cross,
which was creepy.
[SPEAKER_09]: B.O.G.
[SPEAKER_09]: and Girl Scout.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was 25, maybe 24, probably 24.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ryan's Rhino, 100 percent Sativa,
25 percent.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then form Girl Scout cookies tested
right around 27.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this guy crushed it.
[SPEAKER_06]: He had some great, great tests.
[SPEAKER_06]: My veganic lemon, Jeffrey, tested right
around 24 percent, if that gives you some.
[SPEAKER_09]: Which, by the way, that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the best veganic weed I've
probably ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: How much veganic weed have you smoked?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know?
[SPEAKER_09]: I've smoked some.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've smoked some from, there's a place in
the Springs.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's the Natural Mystics.
[SPEAKER_09]: They sell it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really the only really place.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I tried some of Buds and Roses at
the Cubs and that was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kyle Cushman's veganics.
[SPEAKER_06]: So mine stood up to Kyle Cushman's.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a hell of a compliment.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a different, it's definitely a,
you have a thing for Sativas and not a lot
[SPEAKER_09]: of people like Sativas, but I like the,
you know, the citrusy, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: really high highs.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it was good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let a plant take more time to grow like a
Sativa does to let you get more out of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's nothing but the longer, the better,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_09]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Depending on your technique, you know what
I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Guys, quit cutting your plants down too
early.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I was just, and Jesse,
to give him some credit in the game,
[SPEAKER_06]: he won the Pueblo Super Bud Bowl and they
gave him hell of a huge compliment.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you guys listened to past episodes,
we talked about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: The judges of the Super Bud Bowl said that
Jesse's strains stood out in flavor,
[SPEAKER_06]: aroma, taste and effect overall without a
doubt.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was the hands down winner, the freaking
champ, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Grape OG.
[SPEAKER_06]: Grape OG.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a hell of a strain too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I took some cuts of it today.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: So these guys are, we're all experienced
growers here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm of course the breeder from
iRegenetics, so I know what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to talk a little bit about
clones and seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you guys, do you have a preference,
Jesse, from going, growing from clone or
[SPEAKER_06]: seed?
[SPEAKER_08]: It has more to do with the admission,
I guess, of, you know, whatever particular
[SPEAKER_08]: round, but I'd grow from seed if that was,
you know, all I could do from now on.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're going to set up, I guess a
better question would be if you're going
[SPEAKER_06]: to set up a giant warehouse, not a giant,
what if I give you 20 lights and I was 20
[SPEAKER_06]: flowering lights and it's all yours,
you're going to start brand new,
[SPEAKER_06]: would you grow from clones or seeds at
that point?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd probably go with clones.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: How about you, Spence, if you had 20
lights to play with?
[SPEAKER_09]: If I had it to play with, I'd probably
take like two lights and maybe do some
[SPEAKER_09]: seeds, but there's just, you know,
when you're that scale, you want something
[SPEAKER_09]: that's proven to give you what you want.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a perfect segue into what I was
going to say.
[SPEAKER_06]: Clones, the pros of clones are that you
know you've got females, those have been
[SPEAKER_06]: ran and tested.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you've got a clone, I'll talk a
little bit about a clone and give some
[SPEAKER_06]: setup for what they are, because people
are new listeners.
[SPEAKER_06]: A clone is a cutting taken from a plant,
a mother plant, that you hopefully have
[SPEAKER_06]: ran before and flowered out and you know
that that's some good shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or someone else has.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or someone else has.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of your trusted bros like Spence or
Jesse at the table, if they give me a
[SPEAKER_06]: clone, I definitely appreciate it and
trust it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't usually get dispensary clones and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're mediocre most of the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you got to know who you're getting it
from, but usually it's a reliable crop.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a female.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody in the crew has grown it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can say that takes eight weeks,
that takes nine weeks, that takes 10
[SPEAKER_06]: weeks, or be careful because that fucker
might harm if you over nitrogen it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there's things we know.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's one of the super, super pros of
a clone.
[SPEAKER_06]: We know the growth patterns.
[SPEAKER_06]: We know if we need to top it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We know if we need to train it a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: We know how tall it's going to get.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that the sour diesel cut I've got,
if you let it grow more than two feet tall
[SPEAKER_06]: in veg, it's going to be eight feet tall
in flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that from, we've grown it
several times.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I grew that one time and I
learned.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you learned quick on that shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's tickling your lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you know what to feed it also,
because you know how long it's going to
[SPEAKER_06]: take.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know when to begin flushing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know when it's going to be done.
[SPEAKER_06]: The cons of clones.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is why I was asking about the giant
wire.
[SPEAKER_06]: In our house, clones are where you get
most of your damn bugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think when some, one of your buddies
tries to give you a sweet cut,
[SPEAKER_06]: a sour diesel, and you get it to your
garden and you're irresponsible and it's
[SPEAKER_06]: partly your responsibility to quarantine
and treat that thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: But sometimes you fail yourself just like
that guy did.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you end up with spider mites,
the feared hemp russet mite in your weed
[SPEAKER_06]: garden right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those things will take down your entire
crop in two days.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a friend tell me he had those.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, you want to see them?
Nope.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even want to see you anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you ever get those, just start over.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fire is the cure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually, I have something I'm
experimenting with, a product.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I've mentioned it on the
show because I don't want to say anything
[SPEAKER_06]: until I'm familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems to kill everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, if you do it wrong,
it will kill everything.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I volunteered a few plants and I did a few
different applications and a couple of
[SPEAKER_06]: them just fucking cooked them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if I learn to do it right,
I feel like it'll work well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to learn it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to make you hard to hear.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesse's afraid of the microphone.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, right there, we can hear you all day
just like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I keep worrying about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you guys are wondering what that furry
sound is, it's music in the background.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not Jesse's beard rubbing on the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we get our bugs, our problems,
our diseases, our pathogens.
[SPEAKER_06]: Powdery mildew comes from clones.
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeds do not carry bugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: They do not carry diseases.
[SPEAKER_06]: They do not carry pathogens.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something about a clone, if I grow a pack
of seeds and I pick the keeper out of
[SPEAKER_06]: that, so you grow 10 seeds, there'll be
different phenotypes in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully you find that one that's
stellar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe my opinion of that stellar plant is
way different than Spence's opinion or way
[SPEAKER_06]: different than Jesse's opinion or the
other guy growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I like the ability to pick my own,
which is a benefit of the seed and a con
[SPEAKER_06]: of the clone.
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe my grow style or what I'm
looking for is way different than what you
[SPEAKER_06]: guys are looking for.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you get a 10 pack of seeds,
how many keepers do you hope to find out
[SPEAKER_06]: of those?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you hope for that just one or are you
looking for all 10 of them?
[SPEAKER_09]: I just look for differences throughout
because depending on what kind of seeds
[SPEAKER_09]: you're popping, you'll find differences
and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I usually try to keep three just so if
I have three plants that don't all look
[SPEAKER_09]: the same, maybe I just want a better
chance of finding something that's better
[SPEAKER_09]: than one.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good that you say three in my opinion
because usually I find the one that looks
[SPEAKER_06]: like, if you're crossing a male and a
female plant, I like to find the male,
[SPEAKER_06]: like the one that looks like the male,
the one that looks like the female,
[SPEAKER_06]: and then that one that's a hybrid of the
two.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's usually a good way to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then smoke all those, get them tested,
do what you can, have the crew smoke them,
[SPEAKER_06]: make shatter out of them, make live resin
out of them, see what happens with all
[SPEAKER_06]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cure them a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cure them a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's something I failed at when I was a
new grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would take that stuff and as soon as it
was dry enough to start smoking,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd start smoking.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd start smoking it up, see which was my
favorite.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure I got rid of a few keepers.
[SPEAKER_06]: That I just didn't even know yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess that leads us into seeds a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you buy a 10-pack of seeds,
I really like that variation.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you buy a 10-pack, you pop them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes there's fucking seven males in
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but that's nature.
[SPEAKER_06]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: It does happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a numbers game.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like bingo.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is like bingo.
[SPEAKER_06]: So hopefully you get that one good one.
[SPEAKER_06]: So hopefully you get some five.
[SPEAKER_06]: Five males, five females is usually what I
hope for somewhere in that area.
[SPEAKER_06]: You hope to get one that you can spot
right away that you're like, hey,
[SPEAKER_06]: we got to call that bitch.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you got those four to work with.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like Spence said, you get three.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's where you find new stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one of the pros of growing from
seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: You find all that new stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And here's something I thought about
earlier.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything we're growing came from seed in
the first place.
[SPEAKER_08]: Down the road.
[SPEAKER_08]: The way it's supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We couldn't have a plant without the seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody took a clone of OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_08]: If everyone keeps growing from clone,
there are very bad consequences to that.
[SPEAKER_08]: What could happen?
[SPEAKER_08]: Big major companies could maintain control
of the seed stock, similar to some
[SPEAKER_08]: ornamental flowers that I can't quote
species of or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I know it's really hard to find like
genuine seed of some flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of the vegetables, you can only
find specific seeds.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_06]: See, so we, it's, there you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: More beneficial to grow from seed or a
benefit of growing from seed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or they'll just start selling only family
seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, there won't be a gene pool.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's something as a breeder,
I try to pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_06]: I try to make, and you guys have probably
noticed, I've been pulling out a lot more
[SPEAKER_06]: reg seeds lately.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got to have reg seeds because you got
to have the males to keep the breeding
[SPEAKER_06]: alive or it's going to get stale.
[SPEAKER_06]: F1 hybrids are where it's at.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys, if you're breeding, please throw
away the bullshit.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's going to be some stuff that comes
out of your breeding projects that is not
[SPEAKER_06]: worth re-breeding or giving out those
seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just toss those.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause you're polluting the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're making it weak.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're making a bunch of runts and mutants
and you're fucking it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just get rid of all that non-elite star,
non-elite stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the poser stuff and just kill it,
dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just kill it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can breed more seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's more coming.
[SPEAKER_09]: I definitely give props to the people who
actually try their own seeds.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like if you, if you produce some seeds,
actually grow it.
[SPEAKER_09]: See what it is before you give it to
people, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give a bunch of it away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also give them away so that other people
can, so you can see what Nancy Budwell,
[SPEAKER_06]: shout out to Nancy Budwell, what she's
done.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, that lady grows some fine cannabis
under, under LEDs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not even a big fan of LEDs and she is
killing it with that shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I'm actually, I like that you say
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You keep saying good shit to make more
good shit to talk about.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm growing the night nurse right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, she looks stellar.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one that looks really grateful dog
dominant, but smells like Tora Bora.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it'll pass those CBDs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope so.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need some good CBD medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: So with the seeds, you get new stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we were talking about, you get to do
that phenotype hunt.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's, that's essentially when you pop a
pack of seeds, they call it mapping or
[SPEAKER_06]: searching or hunting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Subcool calls it something different.
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot what he even calls it,
but it's a phenotype hunt in this group is
[SPEAKER_06]: what we call it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You run as many seeds as you can get of
one strain.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can do 20 of them, do 20.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: 25 of something is cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you've only got a 10 or a six pack or a
five pack, that works too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just work on your scale.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the more, the better.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that gives you, you can see what
that strain's potential is and you know
[SPEAKER_06]: what you're looking for a little better
and you can get that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I know what I want out of a grateful
dog pack of beans.
[SPEAKER_06]: You may want something totally different
out of a pack of dog beans.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll find it by doing that phenotype
hunt.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's fun to me running that hunt,
seeing the variations.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as a breeder, I love seeing the
variations from my creations.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we're growing clones, we're all growing
the same shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a blue dream cut going around.
[SPEAKER_06]: This town right now, going around
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's just this town.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it is just Colorado in general.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like every time I see somebody post a
picture of blue dream is like,
[SPEAKER_09]: dear God, there it is again.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the same blue dream.
[SPEAKER_09]: Harvest's heavy though.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, I love it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll grow in any type of conditions and
she'll give you some product back if
[SPEAKER_09]: you're good to her.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can pull six ounces out of a seven
gallon pot with four of them per light.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a pound and a half of herb.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let her go about 70 days.
[SPEAKER_06]: She packs it on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that Andy's blue dream cut?
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Andy.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up ABD?
[SPEAKER_08]: Come get your stuff back.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're done.
[SPEAKER_06]: We love it so much.
[SPEAKER_06]: We hate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so good that it's just terrible.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we love the Andy's blue dream.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't mean to call it terrible.
[SPEAKER_06]: How about the cons of growing from seed?
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people are not good at spotting
males.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the main problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if you're a beginner grower,
sometimes you don't even know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know people that have seen male plants
and like, is there ever going to be
[SPEAKER_09]: flowers from there?
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's like, no, these are two
completely different things.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just think it's about paying
attention.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you pay attention, you've got to see.
[SPEAKER_08]: Read a book.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every grow book has a picture of a male
and a female right next to each other.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, spot your males.
[SPEAKER_06]: What about mutants?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes you get that crazy mutant shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're fun.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're funky.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Ken Dog is a mutant.
[SPEAKER_08]: The person or the noun?
Both.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Ken Dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're writing Ken Dog,
it's C-H-E-M-D-O-G.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, D-O-G.
[SPEAKER_06]: He corrected us.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's D-O-G.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out Ken Dog.
[SPEAKER_08]: I used to have a dog named that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, D-O-G.
[SPEAKER_06]: D-O-G.
[SPEAKER_06]: My buddy Ryan had a dog named D-O-G.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was a cool ass dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up guys?
[SPEAKER_06]: I miss you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't seen you guys in a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't listen to the show, but still
thinking about you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Selection time.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're growing from seed,
there's always that fino hunt.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're growing from clones,
that first crop you're going to grow,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's blue dream.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got all the blue dream you can handle.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're running from seed,
you got to run a crop to find what you're
[SPEAKER_06]: even messing with.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then run a crop to keep again of the
ones you like.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then if you need to eliminate more,
then you're going to run it again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again and again and narrow it down.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and then hopefully you take clones.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said on another episode,
take clones of everything you ever grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: Before it's in flower.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, before you fly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like yeah, 15 days before you put it in
flower, take some clones.
[SPEAKER_06]: That way you know those clones are going
to root.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you don't have clones, you can try
again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like give yourself a chance.
[SPEAKER_06]: Plant ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: Plant ahead when you're growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always beneficial.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give yourself the advantage.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The advantage.
[SPEAKER_06]: The heads up for yourself is don't put
yourself behind.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because once you're behind in growing,
you're behind in growing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that probably means your plants are
stressed out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're stressed, they are.
[SPEAKER_06]: You ain't lying.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, the cons of seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you need, you got to learn each
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like when you find those phenotypes,
you got to learn them and you got to
[SPEAKER_06]: learn.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like having three different
girlfriends if you found three keepers.
[SPEAKER_06]: One's going to like a lot of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_06]: One's going to get mad at too much
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_06]: One's going to be really picky.
[SPEAKER_06]: One's going to be really easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: One's going to bud out.
[SPEAKER_06]: One's going to taste real good.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to have to learn each
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_06]: One may go a little longer.
[SPEAKER_06]: One may come down a little sooner.
[SPEAKER_06]: One may need to be topped.
[SPEAKER_06]: One may climb a little up into the fucking
lights real high.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to learn all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: The con, of course, that comes with that
is wasted space.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, if you're a cashcropper, the seeds
that kind of messes you up.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what about femme seeds?
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I've grown femme seeds.
[SPEAKER_09]: They take away the worry about having a
male.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are still chances where you'll get
some funky stuff, but you just got to
[SPEAKER_09]: still pay attention.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've made some funky stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've grown some funky stuff for me that
I'm not even going to say the strain to
[SPEAKER_06]: discourage anybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's still good though.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because I'm seeing excellent
phenotypes coming out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got some downstairs that looks
gnarly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Spence grew one that shot out a stick with
a gigantic leaf the size of bigger than my
[SPEAKER_06]: hand and then another stick and then like
normal size leaves that I don't even
[SPEAKER_06]: remember went on because I just looked
away.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like seeing a car wreck.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can look for a minute, but then you're
like fuck.
[SPEAKER_09]: It had a reattach amputee arm,
but it was cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes I like things like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's going to be a female, I'm the type
of girl where I'll give it a chance.
[SPEAKER_09]: If it doesn't work, it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's always more seeds to plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are always more seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't be afraid to call something.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you guys have something that is a level
eight, let's work fun getting you guys a
[SPEAKER_06]: level 10.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go find that 10.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get you some good seeds, some regulars or
fins.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Survival of the fittest.
[SPEAKER_09]: Survival of the fittest.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know seeds are expensive and we just
talk like you could just pop more,
[SPEAKER_06]: but it's well worth it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're growing herb, you should be
doing all right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You should at least be able to afford a
pack of seeds after the harvest.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I mentioned Femseeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Femseeds, just a quick little,
that's Red Rat in the background there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That got my attention.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to show the music.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to dance around like Wookiees
for a second.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll remember where we were.
[SPEAKER_06]: Take a dab with us guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got some really cool ass people in the
room today.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really honored to have these guys as
guests.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got some acid in the car.
[SPEAKER_08]: You just said dance around like Wookiees,
so.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a really random statement to say
on a recording.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really high, so.
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't mean that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a joke.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I actually, battery acid.
[SPEAKER_08]: Doesn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to grab this torch out of your
way.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a joke guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which rig you going for, Spence?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can hit the Hitman with the highly
educated titanium domeless nail.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some stuff in the works with
highly educated right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's that classic reggae air horn.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got to love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we were doing a podcast and now
suddenly we're taking a break and dabbing
[SPEAKER_06]: guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you like the way potheads work.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you're taking a dab while I am too.
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd only be right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Grab that beer rig.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jess, take a dab with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have a three rig session.
[SPEAKER_06]: There aren't three torches, but we'll make
it happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's some turpex if you want that.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some live over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're spoiled here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we were in Texas, this table would
equal life in prison.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're black, so that's two lives.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, you won't catch me there.
[SPEAKER_12]: I promise that.
[SPEAKER_08]: The best thing about Texas is seeing the
state line in your rear view.
[SPEAKER_06]: I won't.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have a reason to go to Texas or a
reason to hate on Texas really,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I don't have a reason to go there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Food and people down there know how to
party.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got some good friends that are from
Texas and they're actually all good
[SPEAKER_06]: people.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just lost my headphones.
[SPEAKER_06]: They die out.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll tap on the thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll work again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Headphones working, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't if you guys are buying gear for a
podcast, never buy a live wire solutions,
[SPEAKER_06]: headphone, four channel stereo,
headphone amplifier.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the third one I've gotten,
dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know you're like, why'd you get a
third one?
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause if you go to guitar center with it
and you yell at them, they keep just
[SPEAKER_06]: giving you a fresh one.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just keep reusing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So three people just smoked a gram of hash
and like three dads, one dad each.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got some on my phone on the tape later.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your phone is probably the only thing
without hash on it up until now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty much my life.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything is all sticky.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to call the recording studio,
the sticky knobs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought people might take that wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, that part of the show was brought to
you by oil slick, oil slick tools to help
[SPEAKER_06]: you concentrate.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just set my stuff down on this fancy oil
slick pad here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to get any sticky rings on
my table.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a really nice oil slick pad there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, don't you, uh, don't you work at a
hydro shop?
[SPEAKER_06]: What were they called again?
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, high grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're called high grow Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check out high grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're awesome over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, Jesse does a lot of lifting and
moving.
[SPEAKER_06]: So all the organization and stuff,
uh, give shout outs to Jesse.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're working in the fucking hot Colorado
heat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, it's August 9th.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to give a quick shout out to Jerry
Garcia.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_06]: Much respect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jerry Garcia.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, Jerry changed my life, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I never got to see Jerry live,
but the music of the Grateful Dead and the
[SPEAKER_06]: culture of the Grateful Dead are
definitely in my heart.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is big part of my world.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll get back to the point here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Podcast time, feminized seeds,
always females most of the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I'll say now.
[SPEAKER_06]: 99% of the time females.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesse told us a story before about a
dispensary owner running 200 and something
[SPEAKER_06]: feminized seeds and having four males.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect math fucked up everything.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you get a bunch of seeds?
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, what was that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just saw your brain go blank.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like when you're at a house and your
fucking balance clicks in and the lights
[SPEAKER_06]: go dim real quick, you just went blink and
you came back right fast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like where were we?
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, did you get a bunch of seeds from that
run where the dispensary owner fucked it
[SPEAKER_06]: all up?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they had a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, um, they tried to sell them too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's a dispensary for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: They had no idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the problem with fem seeds,
me being a feminized seed maker,
[SPEAKER_06]: I know this is the big problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't know you've got a problem until
like week seven or week eight when you've
[SPEAKER_06]: already invested a lot of time into that
plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're running fem seeds,
my advice, and this is what I do,
[SPEAKER_06]: I flower them little.
[SPEAKER_06]: I run them in a three gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I veg them for very minimal time until I
can take three cuts off of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And once they're all big enough for three
cuts, I flower them out the first time to
[SPEAKER_06]: find out what I've got.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you can find out if you've got
trouble or if you've got gold.
[SPEAKER_06]: So go early with the fems if you can,
just to find out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would do that with any plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had some, uh, some fire seeds from
fem.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's an odd noise.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't hear that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That could be Spence's phone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody was growing hops.
[SPEAKER_09]: That shit was tight.
[SPEAKER_09]: On your phone?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Growing hops?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It looked like weed?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's related to weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like the cousin.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like a black cousin.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like a black cousin.
[SPEAKER_08]: A viney plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my nigga hops.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to hops.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could say that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Spence said I could say that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I can say that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cool.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't believe I just said that on the
podcast though.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: He made me, he makes me say shout out to
my nigga Spence.
[SPEAKER_09]: I gave him his pass a year and a half ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got my pass y'all.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys brought up beer.
[SPEAKER_08]: I, uh, whoa.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can hear now?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Start working.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I can kind of hear now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can really hear.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a beer making friend and we had a
serious conversation last night about
[SPEAKER_08]: making a marijuana beer.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't drink, but I would try one of
those.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to say I drank a marijuana beer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Spence and I might split it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I get, I get a little turn off one beer.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were talking about like a really small
recipe.
[SPEAKER_08]: So.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you could ferment that beer in
your grow room and use your weed beer CO2
[SPEAKER_06]: to enhance your ganja plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Would that be a little sacrilegious?
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of ballistic almost.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's your fermenting brothers.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want it to be.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want it to be.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to beer.
[SPEAKER_06]: I miss you beer.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't had a beer in a long,
long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm better off without it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I haven't had a beer since I got
my very first medical marijuana card.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's when I was like, you know,
I don't need to drink.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got the card.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can smoke all the herb I want.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice trade off with myself.
[SPEAKER_08]: My dad kind of sorted it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: He still drinks occasionally.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Mr. Witt.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're, if you're listening to the
show, man, what's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's me.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up, pops?
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a cool ass dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool ass dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're kind of ranting about Femseeds a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Femseeds I've noticed and you might,
you guys, I don't know if you've paid
[SPEAKER_06]: enough attention.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I'm looking more, I'm the breeder.
[SPEAKER_06]: Femseeds are always a closer
representation of the parents I've found.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't get as much, like when we run
gauges F1s.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's not, there's not as much variation
as what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Femseeds are more uniform.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're closer.
[SPEAKER_06]: They look a lot alike.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we run gauges F1s, we never know what
we're going to get.
[SPEAKER_06]: A 10 pack varies so much, unless it was
asparare.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those were awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you suppose that's because they are
supposedly missing the male chromosomes?
[SPEAKER_06]: That, and you're not introducing,
it feels like when you're bringing out the
[SPEAKER_06]: F1s, I feel like you're getting a lot of
recessive traits and you're just not
[SPEAKER_06]: bringing, it could be because of the male
chromosomes are missing, but it feels like
[SPEAKER_06]: you're not going back.
[SPEAKER_06]: As far in the lineage, they forgot who
their grandparents were somehow just by
[SPEAKER_06]: selfing them.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's what it feels like.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm also doing a lot of selfing of one
plant and using it to pollinate the same
[SPEAKER_06]: strain.
[SPEAKER_06]: So those are starting to come out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've done that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm on the, it's inbred, but it's kind of
an F3 is what level I'm at.
[SPEAKER_06]: The grateful dog S3, they are almost all
looking the same by now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome props on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a dank strain by the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the one that put me on the map,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to the Cali Connection and
Swerve because just shout out to those
[SPEAKER_06]: guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: They did me a favor.
[SPEAKER_06]: So shout out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to actually bring up in this
conversation that there's so many S1s and
[SPEAKER_08]: F1s out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we were talking about protecting the
lineage and everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can't really do that with F1s,
S1s.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you got to F3.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to get to F3.
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Short says F2 is crucial.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where a lot of stuff is really
where you got to pay attention because
[SPEAKER_06]: I've fucked up the F2s.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been like, oh no, I chose the wrong
F1 to put to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then was like, nope, that's not,
I got to go find a different male out of
[SPEAKER_06]: this mix because this is not where,
or a different female and try this again.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just have to go back.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to keep seeds of each one and
label them what they were.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like this is the, I'll say golden goat
times daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the first run and make sure that
those are legit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I want to find a golden goat
dominant one out of there and hit it again
[SPEAKER_06]: with the daybreaker male.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm hoping to make it look a lot like
daybreaker and smell like golden goat.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have the goat's vigor.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if it doesn't, I could just have to
back up again and go find another female
[SPEAKER_06]: to use and just keep, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Eventually I'll ditch a project if I have
to go back too many times, twice.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I don't get it this first or second
time, I'm like, yeah, that obviously
[SPEAKER_06]: doesn't want to do what I want it to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Out of so many seeds, you should get what
you want the first or second, first or
[SPEAKER_06]: second try.
[SPEAKER_08]: The depo dog strain I had or have,
I had to do it three times before I was
[SPEAKER_08]: happy with it the first time.
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then continued from there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Due to like leaks and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh man, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And something in me says, if it doesn't
work the first time or the second time,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm probably not going to get what I want.
[SPEAKER_06]: I keep cutting that music out a little too
much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's a random, this is kind of off
topic, but on topic.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you guys feel?
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you seen where Aryan goes to places?
[SPEAKER_06]: Aryan from greenhouse seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: They travel to places and get land race
genetics from I'll say Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they went to like, they went to
somewhere in India, Nepal, or somewhere
[SPEAKER_06]: like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't pay enough attention.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just have to watch things quickly while
I'm trimming.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they go to these places and they get
their land race seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so now Aryan's got all land races from
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in exchange, he leaves them a handful
of.
[SPEAKER_06]: Reg seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Femseeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Femseeds and regs.
[SPEAKER_06]: He'll give them a fems and regs,
but he gives them handfuls of seeds to
[SPEAKER_06]: grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he tells them what they are.
[SPEAKER_06]: But now those land races are gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because it's just open pollination.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he just made off with the last of the
land race seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: Introducing hybrids and modern and
developed world genetics into fragile
[SPEAKER_08]: places that have land race genetics like
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of a douche bag thing to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the nicest way I can say it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the same thing as releasing animals
that are not from that area.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or insects that are not from that area.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to wreak havoc on shit and
destroy the ecosystem that's already there
[SPEAKER_06]: and disrupt the balance.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or asking all the farmers to grow some GMO
corn.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he's kind of doing the same thing to
them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys think about that when you're
doing what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of think about the effects that
you're having, like the ripples that you
[SPEAKER_06]: make in your life, because little stuff
makes big, big ripples.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's that saying about a butterfly in
the rainforest and a monsoon somewhere
[SPEAKER_08]: else?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: If a hippie scratches his nuts in Pueblo,
there's a tidal wave in China somewhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something like that happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So all your hippies scratching your nuts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're causing tidal waves.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was a random rant on the pros and
cons of seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess the it's still, I think they're
equal in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's benefits of both.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a reason to run seeds and there's
a benefit to run clones.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as a seed breeder, I should probably
big up the seeds a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_06]: But to tell you the truth, all those
famous cuts that you're getting,
[SPEAKER_06]: they're a famous cut for a reason.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we all have, everybody in this room
grows the cookies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody in this room has got a gorilla
glue for a cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you will by the end of the day then.
[SPEAKER_08]: I could use another cut of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw your Instagram.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we all saw that beautiful gorilla
glue.
[SPEAKER_09]: Who'd that come from?
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want to give someone a shout out?
[SPEAKER_09]: Shout out to Mariano's Clones.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's his Instagram.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's out of Cali, Southern Cali,
not Southern Cali, maybe like Central
[SPEAKER_09]: Cali.
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably some of the best clones I've ever
received as far as a month.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got them like a month and four days ago
or something, and they have literally
[SPEAKER_09]: blown the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen pictures.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're healthy.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're happy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check out at Garden of Weeden on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: Garden of Weed, capital N.
[SPEAKER_06]: At the end of it, it's all detached to the
Garden of Weeden.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's websites, Facebook, Tumblr.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_09]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did not talk about auto flower plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one thing I wanted to mention.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's just ... Whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how I feel.
[SPEAKER_06]: Auto flower plants are ... I will never
breed.
[SPEAKER_06]: People always ask me if I will make an
auto flower as a breeder, and I always say
[SPEAKER_06]: no.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not for big boys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then some people are going to hate me for
saying that.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you need a fast production crop and
you're not familiar with the cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: plant, that may work for you, but it's not
connoisseur grade herb in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesse and I are familiar with one epic
freaking use of auto flower plants to
[SPEAKER_06]: discredit all the shit I just talked.
[SPEAKER_06]: We live in a community that is about 40
minutes away from a national forest,
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe an hour, depending on which routes
you take.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a legendary fucking bust of ...
There was a Mexican cartel in the national
[SPEAKER_06]: forest running a giant grow operation all
year long, very covertly in a valley that
[SPEAKER_06]: they were hiking in and hiking out.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were camped there.
[SPEAKER_06]: They found food there.
[SPEAKER_06]: They said these guys had been camped for a
month.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very, very covertly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The people that owned the land around
there were oblivious to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They had irrigation system set up coming
from the river running downhill,
[SPEAKER_06]: watering all the plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like a movie set up.
[SPEAKER_08]: They had three different places.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you go out there?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hikeable.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's area where we can hike to.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jess went out there and hiked,
so we'll let them tell you about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: They clear cut.
[SPEAKER_08]: A good seven acres of just prime national
forest.
[SPEAKER_08]: Trees, full-sized trees.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just cut them down, clear cut them.
[SPEAKER_08]: No thought to drainage or no respect for
the environment whatsoever to be the
[SPEAKER_08]: hippie.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I was told it was a mess out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew one of the ... Not to blow too many
fucking whistles, but I know a friend of
[SPEAKER_06]: mine's father is a retired cop,
and he's cool as shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: My buddy's a dab head, and dab's sitting
on the couch next to his dad who was a cop
[SPEAKER_06]: at the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was telling us that there were plants
out there of all stages.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Eight inches tall, 12 inches tall,
three feet tall.
[SPEAKER_06]: He said there were bags of buds and a
manicuring station.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was tripping out because when this place
was discovered was not flowering season.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like spring or some shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was saying that they already had plants
six foot tall, three foot tall with big
[SPEAKER_06]: buds on them in flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no way that they could have set up
a light dep out there on seven acres
[SPEAKER_06]: without being busted.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were using auto flower plants,
which that's the best use of auto flowers
[SPEAKER_06]: I could ever see.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're trying to do some crazy outdoor
where you've got enough time right after
[SPEAKER_06]: the cold, get those in the ground,
you might be able to pull off an outdoor
[SPEAKER_06]: crop.
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably so.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were living up there.
[SPEAKER_08]: They had quite the little city.
[SPEAKER_08]: I may have found a plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: I may have moved it down just to see what
happened.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was totally an auto flower.
[SPEAKER_08]: Could there have been any seeds up there
by chance?
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably so.
[SPEAKER_08]: The plant I found was actually a male auto
flowering plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: I killed it, burned it, stomped it into
the ground.
[SPEAKER_08]: You fuck a male auto flower plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's super, super dangerous.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is just going to bust in your room
one day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Spencer's eyeballs are about to pop out of
his head.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you feel when you find a male in
the grow room about three weeks into
[SPEAKER_06]: flower?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's only happened once.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, it's probably one of the
saddest days.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can compare it to the feeling of when a
condom breaks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's like you walk in the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can tell once it's that far in if you
can't tell something's wrong.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just kind of heartbreaking because at
that point you don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't know what it hit, if it hit,
if it's dropping pollen, is it not
[SPEAKER_09]: dropping pollen.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's just too many questions going on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then when you find some seeds in your nugs
three months later, it's like,
[SPEAKER_09]: well damn, there it goes.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's the results.
[SPEAKER_06]: Saw it go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys pay attention with the males,
that root of that plant in the back.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you see a yellow dust on your leaf.
[SPEAKER_08]: I discovered a male one time by that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those nanners just erupted.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, be careful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep an eye on your feminized seeds too
because fem seeds can turn into
[SPEAKER_06]: hermaphrodites or males.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope we actually covered something.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got dabbed as shit on this episode
talking about this, so I hope we made some
[SPEAKER_06]: sort of sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to stress my point again.
[SPEAKER_08]: Growing from seeds is awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything came from seed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you grow for the curiosity and just the
love of the plant and you've never grown
[SPEAKER_08]: from seed, well, I question your curiosity
then.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if you grow from seed, I grow from
seed because there's a possibility of
[SPEAKER_09]: finding something that people don't have.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my answer for you right there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll grow a pack of seeds to find a pheno
that maybe two people out of a couple
[SPEAKER_09]: hundred people that have bought in packs
have.
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows one day that strain could be
everything you wanted to.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen seeds, I forget the term for it,
but I have bred seeds that the outcome has
[SPEAKER_06]: been better than both parents.
[SPEAKER_06]: It got more vigor and more trichomes than
the two parents I used and I upgraded.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good way to look at it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got something in your brain there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that term.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think DJ Short might have recently said
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody said it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually looked it up when he said it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody tweeted to us at iGrowCulture.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll send you two iRegenetic stickers.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really will.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really, really will.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe something cooler if I can find
something to send you.
[SPEAKER_06]: It will not be seeds or anything,
I promise.
[SPEAKER_06]: I won't ship seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys, stop shipping shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: A friend of ours got in trouble for
shipping shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't call him a friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: This person in the community that is not
anymore in the community got fucking
[SPEAKER_06]: busted shipping shit and it makes us all
look bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes Colorado look stupid.
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes you look stupid.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop shipping shit, please.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want some shit, come get it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's legal in Colorado if you're 21.
[SPEAKER_06]: The dispensary has what you want.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have to mail it to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry to bust up anybody's business
ringing for making some money shipping
[SPEAKER_06]: shit, but there are plenty of sick people
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are plenty of recreational people
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We fought to get this shit right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's legit here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop shipping shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone's nodding their heads.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck middlemen anyways.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Grow your own.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go straight to the grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: Grow your own.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're listening to this podcast,
you're probably not one of the people
[SPEAKER_06]: that's shipping shit anyway, so I don't
even need to bitch at you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're growing your own herb.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got some quality dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're hanging out with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys got anything you want to bullshit
about?
[SPEAKER_06]: I like having you on.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't need to cut off a conversation
here just because I'm out of material to
[SPEAKER_06]: talk about on the seed stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got anything fun to add?
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a story in the news.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shit, I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesse's high.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you remember where you saw it?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll go Google.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll hit the cannabis right quick.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the weed news hits the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: What was it about?
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't even remember.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was comical.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I'm trying to remember.
[SPEAKER_06]: Comical?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say I may have seen it in the
post or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am not sponsored by the cannabis or
anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people disagree with what the
cannabis says.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes they print some articles that I
will agree are fucking wacky.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right as I open the cannabis, there's an
article that says cannabis Q&A,
[SPEAKER_06]: grow room tour, and other reader
questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check out that grow room tour.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to read that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't read it yet, but that'll be
neat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any grow room tour is fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: You might learn something there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ask me if you have questions about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: The three of us in this room, we could
design and build you the most fucking
[SPEAKER_06]: amazing grow room the three of us got
together.
[SPEAKER_09]: God, somebody let me build one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, let the three of us build it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll crush it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be the Lamborghini of a grow room.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bro, I don't see much on the cannabis
worth reading on the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Next time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Next time we'll have some news for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll find something to read.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys got anything cool to add?
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to everybody over at the Garden
of Whedon while Spence is away.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope they're all behaving themselves and
having a good time.

[SPEAKER_06]: We love you always, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: We miss you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Had to ship out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Had to ship out so you could shape up.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are Slop's little pups' names?
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are cute as fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: I always forget.

[SPEAKER_06]: Harvey's the one I forget his name all the
time.

[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good work on those two little pups,
bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't sound like we got a lot.
No.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-oh.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got something to say?
[SPEAKER_09]: Izzy and Pork Chop.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Izzy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I missed Izzy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not very familiar with that one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you pause recording real quick?
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to ask Spence a question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Possibly have a story to tell.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll hit pause right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to hit pause and make sure
that what we can talk about is talkable on
[SPEAKER_06]: a show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I'll just turn the mics down and
the music up, and you guys get down for
[SPEAKER_06]: half a second.

[SPEAKER_06]: We're coming back in.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we are back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yo.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yo, that story was not appropriate for
listeners.
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you missed a fucking hell of a story.
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't air that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's somebody's personal shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there any events coming up?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the Secret Cup's coming up,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Secret Cup.
[SPEAKER_09]: The regional is 30th and 31st are the open
vendor days where you can come and check
[SPEAKER_09]: it out, I guess.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I've got my VIP spot set up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_06]: There'll be a bunch of people.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be fun.

[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, necessarily.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of us were too, we're all prima
donnas and didn't want to go dab in the
[SPEAKER_06]: fucking woods because it's just hard to
plug in your email out there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like to take showers.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not trying to like, stay for three
days.
[SPEAKER_08]: We went camping and had an email with us.
