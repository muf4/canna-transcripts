and Healthy Cannabis in Colorado Springs.

and the comment is, this show is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it up.

WhiteTrike.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like hearing that the show is great,
and I like the encouragement, so I
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely, definitely will keep it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for that comment, and thanks to
everybody that's left a comment in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually got a couple of Twitter
comments I want to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm doing a Doug Benson
stand-up comedy show, because Doug Benson
[SPEAKER_00]: just stands there and reads tweets the
whole time, and that's kind of what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: doing to you guys, but I like supporting
the listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wouldn't be a podcast if there
weren't listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd just be me talking into a mic for no
reason, so I appreciate you guys a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scrolling through, looking for this
notification here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Omnio, he says, sitting in the garden
in the sun while listening to Rasta Jeff
[SPEAKER_00]: on the Grow From Your Heart podcast
explain worm castings, benefits,
[SPEAKER_00]: and seed genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashtag good life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Omnio, dude, thanks for listening to
me while you're gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm hoping for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys are in the garden learning
stuff while you're playing with the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're on the drive to or from work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully I'm in your ear entertaining you
and teaching you something about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, let's see, Adrian Gee, the amazing
Adrian.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, could be a he or a she.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me check on your stuff here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to call you he if you're a
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adrian is kind of a unisex name.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that is a dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that picture, it's definitely a dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, Adrian says, now you got to go back to
your comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Grow From Your Heart podcast,
just started listening to your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of good info.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I replied.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, thanks for listening on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, thanks for listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to teach you guys, trying to
educate a little bit, trying to move
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if we talk more positively about
this plant, people will be less afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: All we got to do is open the door to talk
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, big thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And big shout out to White Trike for the
iTunes comment there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you leave a comment on iTunes or
Stitcher, I will read it on the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't want to leave a comment
on iTunes or Stitcher, send me a tweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at GFYH podcast or find me on
Facebook and I'll respond to you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to say something anonymously,
you can send me a personal or private
[SPEAKER_00]: message and I will keep your name private.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also email me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's a lot of contact
information, but if you want to be in
[SPEAKER_00]: touch, I'd love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said at the beginning of the show
that I had a bunch of news and stuff to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's click on some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clicking away, click, click, click.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm finding the first news article.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first news article is, it kind of hits
home here because I actually am a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way you become a caregiver,
all you really have to do is have... So
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we call the person that smokes
the medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: That person goes to the doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get their medical marijuana
recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you send that into the state
of Colorado, you can assign a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where my name goes onto that
paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name and my address and a copy of my ID
gets sent to the state and I become a
[SPEAKER_00]: caregiver, which means I am now
responsible for growing medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: for my friend who signed me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a limit of five people that
you're allowed to be a caregiver for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can have yourself plus five other
people and you can grow cannabis for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of how it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before you were allowed to have six
plants per person, but then there are
[SPEAKER_00]: doctors that are willing to write you an
extended plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you say my back hurts a lot or I've
got fibromyalgia and I don't smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, I actually make oils out of all
of this and I need a lot more plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: the doctors will be a little compassionate
and they will write you what's called an
[SPEAKER_00]: extended plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes that costs you more money,
but in the long run, that's worth it
[SPEAKER_00]: because you need your medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just allows you to grow more
plants and possess more cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the state has kind of caught on that
some people are going to the doctor and
[SPEAKER_00]: there are some doctors in Colorado that it
just costs money.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want the original six plants,
it's cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go in there and pay a cheap like 45,
$50 visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want 12 plants, they double it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want 25 plants, they pretty much
quadruple your price.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're wanting 50 plants, you're paying
five times what you did before.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some doctors that will write a
99 plant recommendation for $500 flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can grow 99 plants in your house
for $500 for one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it was, but now they're making
all kinds of rules because they've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens is a lot of people sign up
for 99 plants and if you grow 99 seven
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon pots, hopefully you're pulling a
whole bunch of weight and then that's
[SPEAKER_00]: hitting the black market and they're kind
of aware of that and they don't want that
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in the state of Colorado
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really trying to crack down and
tax every gram of pop that's produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a sip here and then I'll
read you this news article I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some yerba mate here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice and hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to be careful with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this news article comes from a website
called The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pull a lot of news articles from this
site.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was actually published February 26th,
so I'm a little bit behind, but this is
[SPEAKER_00]: still relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The article was by Joey Bunch of the
Denver Post.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline is, The article says,
The article says, A state Senate committee
[SPEAKER_00]: on Thursday unanimously approved a bill
that would require medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: caregivers to register and allow state
agencies to share enough information to
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure pot grown for medicine isn't sold
illegally.
[SPEAKER_00]: While pot sold for recreational use has
been subject to a battery of tests and
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations since it became legal last
year, medical marijuana has gone
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively unregulated, requiring only
that caregivers be at least 18 years old
[SPEAKER_00]: and have significant responsibility for
the care of a licensed medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: user.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually a spot on the application
that asks what services you provide for
[SPEAKER_00]: your patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I write spiritual counseling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I write that I drive them to and from
their doctor's appointments because a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of that is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prepare meals for some of my patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ask for what you do, so you got to
fill that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, they denied one of my
caregiver requests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to refill out the paper and put
better reasoning because they did not like
[SPEAKER_00]: my reasons why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was part of their significant
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are paying a little bit of
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get back to the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, The regulatory bill was
characterized by the state agency and law
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement officials as a benefit to
caregivers because those registered would
[SPEAKER_00]: not have to face arrest or a costly legal
proceedings if they're registered with the
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bill is supported by the Colorado
Cannabis Chamber of Commerce.
[SPEAKER_00]: The medical marijuana supporters testified
they were concerned about costs from
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations, patient privacy, and the
risks of untested medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bill is really about assessing law
enforcement, but it's doing so at the
[SPEAKER_00]: expense of the rights of patients and
caregivers, said Colorado marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: activist Robert Chase, who opposed the
legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2009, when the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attorney General's Office advised federal
agents not to intervene in cases that are
[SPEAKER_00]: compliant with state laws, medical
marijuana license have exploded in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2008, there were 4,819 licensed medical
marijuana patients in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_00]: said Senator Irene Aguilar.
[SPEAKER_00]: As of last December, there were 115,467
licensed users, said Aguilar, the bill's
[SPEAKER_00]: Senate sponsor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to keep federal regulators out of
Colorado's pot business, the state must
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate it adequately, she said.
[SPEAKER_00]: The federal expectation is that states
that have allowed marijuana to be legal
[SPEAKER_00]: and local governments will be implementing
strong and effective regulatory and
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement systems that will protect
public safety, public health, and law
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement interests, she said.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the average age of Colorado medical
marijuana user is 42 years old,
[SPEAKER_00]: the number of children has increased in
the past two years on indications pot
[SPEAKER_00]: helps children with seizures and other
illnesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: In March 2013, Colorado had 35 patients
younger than 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: By last December, the number of minors had
grown to 462, Aguilar said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sierra Riddle of Colorado Springs said she
moved from Utah in 2013 because her son
[SPEAKER_00]: has cancer and needs medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of children that are increasing
on the medical marijuana registry needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: be considered because it's only going to
increase more, she said.
[SPEAKER_00]: These rules and laws need to be put in
place to protect our children,
[SPEAKER_00]: to protect their plant count, and to
protect our rights to grow their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this article kind of hits home because
I'm a caregiver myself, and the local
[SPEAKER_00]: rules are changing here to where we are
being reduced on the number of patients we
[SPEAKER_00]: are allowed to have, which will also
reduce the number of plants we are allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: to have, and they have also reduced the
amount of space we are allowed to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means the five people that I am
responsible for providing medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana to, somebody is going to have to
find somebody else to grow their medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: for them, and the state doesn't give a
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I have been responsible for them for
the past seven or eight years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been my responsibility and my duty
to take care of these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have established a relationship with
them, and I have a significant role in
[SPEAKER_00]: caring for these people, but the state
does not care.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to end that and find a new
caregiver to grow their medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's bullshit because I know
these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what strains they like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have bred strains for my patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have people that smoke medical cannabis,
and I will breed strains for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The night nurse was inspired by my friend
Doug.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an older cat, and his body hurts,
and he has a hard time sleeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he smoked the Tora Bora, he said,
holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he smoked the Grateful Dog,
he said, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were two of his favorite strains
ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I felt like it was my job to make a
hybrid of the two and then find the right
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype that worked for Doug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I grew those, he loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, Doug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get to be your caregiver anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the state doesn't give a shit
about our bona fide relationship that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've developed over years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really, Doug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm keeping it, but that's my example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Team Landon, there are little kids out
there with brain tumors, cancers,
[SPEAKER_00]: seizures, lymphoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kids have all kinds of bad things that
adults have, and now we need to let these
[SPEAKER_00]: kids have their caregivers have plant
counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is messed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why I'm fired up, because this is
what started the cannabis movement in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado was medical cannabis and
caregivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caregivers are what started it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The patients and the caregivers are ground
zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now guess who's being screwed right
out of this deal?
[SPEAKER_00]: The patients and the caregivers,
because they want us to be forced to shop
[SPEAKER_00]: at recreational dispensaries where taxes
are fucking ridiculous and we cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: afford it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we going to medicate ourselves
that way?
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we are medicating ourselves
with cannabis is so that we don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: jump through somebody else's hoops,
so that we don't have to go stand in line
[SPEAKER_00]: to pay ridiculous prices for medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're fucking us over, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, end of rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm passionate about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It pisses me off, because the patients
that started medical cannabis are now the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that nobody, I can't say nobody,
the people that most of this industry is
[SPEAKER_00]: looking over right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've forgotten them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about the patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patients first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without the patients, there would have
been no medical marijuana movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: There would not have been caregivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There would have not been home grows,
and we would not have gotten as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: we've gotten today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd be years behind if we did not start
this with medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so think about the patients,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do the best I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to register my grows
with my city and with my state.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to come to my private grow,
and they're going to look through my grows
[SPEAKER_00]: and make sure that I'm following all of
the laws and that everything is done up to
[SPEAKER_00]: code.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to sign up to do that because
I'm well-known around here, and if I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: do it, I know they will come here and they
will try to press some kind of legal
[SPEAKER_00]: charges on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are papers that I can fill out to
have an excuse or an exception to have
[SPEAKER_00]: more patients, but I don't see ... I'm
going to really have to pull a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons out of the air, because they're
paperwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have any compassion.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have check marks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this, this, and this happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then no, and it's just like talking to a
computer instead of a person with
[SPEAKER_00]: compassion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that's enough on that article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, I'm back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a couple dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I calmed down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not so pissed off about that last
article anymore, but we have a whole new
[SPEAKER_00]: article coming up, and this could do a lot
of things to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The subheadline is, another lawsuit has
been filed in federal court over
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado's marijuana legalization
amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline is, new lawsuit, sheriffs
from Colorado and elsewhere challenge
[SPEAKER_00]: amendment 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes the new suit unique is that it
is also asking for a federal judge to
[SPEAKER_00]: overturn amendment 64's protections for
marijuana use and possession.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article is written by Kirk Mitchell
and John Engel of the Denver Post.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six, Colorado sheriffs sued their own
governor in federal court on Thursday,
[SPEAKER_00]: arguing that state laws legalizing
marijuana require them to violate federal
[SPEAKER_00]: law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joining the sheriffs in the lawsuit,
the fourth to be filed against Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: over marijuana legalization, are the
sheriffs and prosecutors from Nebraska and
[SPEAKER_00]: Kansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The suit argues that federal law supremacy
means Colorado cannot allow people to
[SPEAKER_00]: possess or use marijuana for recreational
purposes, and it cannot license stores to
[SPEAKER_00]: sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The law does not challenge Colorado's
medical marijuana laws or stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: The suit is about one thing, the rule of
the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Larimer County Sheriff Justin Smith said
in a news release, release, I said
[SPEAKER_00]: released, geez.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Colorado constitution mandates that
all elected officials, including sheriffs,
[SPEAKER_00]: swear an oath of office to uphold both the
United States as well as the Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: constitutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The suit names governor John Hickenlooper
as the lone defendant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado's attorney general, Cynthia
Kaufman, will defend the state against the
[SPEAKER_00]: lawsuit, a spokesman for her said.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lawsuit, excuse me, the lawsuit has
the backing of national anti-legalization
[SPEAKER_00]: groups and its nationwide ambitions were
apparent in the choice of where to
[SPEAKER_00]: announce the suit.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a news conference Thursday morning at
the National Press Club in Washington,
[SPEAKER_00]: DC, Smith told reporters that Colorado's
passage of amendment 64 created a
[SPEAKER_00]: constitutional shutdown in the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amendment, which voters approved in
2012, made it legal for people over 21 in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado to possess limited amounts of
marijuana and for licensed stores to sell
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that what Colorado has done is
illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think it's unconstitutional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scott's Bluff County, Nebraska,
Sheriff Mark Overman, who was also a
[SPEAKER_00]: plaintiff in the suit, said at the news
conference, I believe my fellow plaintiffs
[SPEAKER_00]: believe that this case is going to have
national ramifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we win, then we can reverse what
looks like a surrender to a pro-marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lawsuit follows another legal
challenge filed in December by Nebraska
[SPEAKER_00]: and Oklahoma, which asked the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supreme Court to strike down the
history-making law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two lawsuits filed earlier this year by
the anti-legalization group Safe Streets
[SPEAKER_00]: Alliance on behalf of several Colorado
residents are also pending against the
[SPEAKER_00]: state over amendment 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar to the previous lawsuits,
the new suit seeks to close all of
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado's recreational marijuana stores,
but it also asks a federal judge to
[SPEAKER_00]: overturn amendment 64's protections for
marijuana use and possession.
[SPEAKER_00]: The law enforcement official's suit
claimed that local officers are breaking
[SPEAKER_00]: federal law and international treaties
when they find marijuana, but they do not
[SPEAKER_00]: seize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Thursday's news conference,
Yuma County Sheriff Chad Day said
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado's marijuana laws now prohibit
officers from seizing marijuana in certain
[SPEAKER_00]: circumstances, putting officers,
he said, in an inevitable position.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: By supporting and upholding one,
we're violating the other, he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to, at very least,
get an answer from the courts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, these cops are not robots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are people and they know what they're
supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys are acting like we've got
droids out there acting as police officers
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're gonna flip their switch and make
their computers crash.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is ridiculous, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam Kamen, I'm probably saying that wrong,
Sam Kay, a law professor at the University
[SPEAKER_00]: of Denver, was skeptical of the sheriff's
argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said no law requires local officers to
act as de facto federal drug agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the four lawsuits, this is the one with
the least merit, Kamen said.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have targeted not just the marijuana
store regulation piece, but they're also
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially saying Colorado can't legalize
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one has ever gone that far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado plaintiffs in the latest lawsuit
include Smith, Day, Elbert County Sheriff
[SPEAKER_00]: Shane Heap, Hensdale County Sheriff Ronald
Bruce, Kiowa County Sheriff Casey
[SPEAKER_00]: Sheridan, and Delta County Sheriff
Frederick McKee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the six Colorado sheriffs involved in
the lawsuit, only Smith is from a county
[SPEAKER_00]: that approved Amendment 64, with 55% of
86,410 voters approving the measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The measure was approved in 33 of 64
Colorado counties by a 55% margin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also named as plaintiffs are three
Nebraska sheriffs, Adam Hayward of Duell
[SPEAKER_00]: County, Mark Overman of Scotts Bluff
County, and John Jensen of Cheyenne
[SPEAKER_00]: County.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheyenne County Attorney Paul Schaub of
Nebraska, and Sheriff Charles Moser of
[SPEAKER_00]: Sherman, Wallace, and Greeley Counties in
Kansas, also signed to the document.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I kind of stumbled on that last
part there, but that was a lot of names,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was really all.
[SPEAKER_00]: As in the lawsuit filed in Nebraska and
Oklahoma, the law enforcement officials
[SPEAKER_00]: from Nebraska and Kansas are arguing in
the new lawsuit that marijuana flowing out
[SPEAKER_00]: of Colorado post-legalization has led to
more arrests and strained their budgets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna jump in here and say,
so legalize pot in your states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just legalize weed in Nebraska and
Oklahoma and Kansas, and you won't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: worry about arresting more people and
straining your budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to sell cannabis like we do
here in Colorado, and you'll be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: fill up your cash registers at the stores,
and you'll be able to fix your stupid ass
[SPEAKER_00]: roads that you guys have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it, come on, let's use our
fucking brains, people.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, it's actually taking money out
of Sherman County taxpayers' pockets,
[SPEAKER_00]: Burton P. Nalto, the sheriff in Sherman
County, Kansas said at Thursday's news
[SPEAKER_00]: conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: In January, nine out of the 46 people
booked into Sherman County's jail were
[SPEAKER_00]: suspected of possessing or distributing
hallucinogenic drugs, the category under
[SPEAKER_00]: which marijuana is classified in Kansas
criminal law, according to an online
[SPEAKER_00]: booking log.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two out of the 15 inmates listed on
Thursday as being currently housed in the
[SPEAKER_00]: county jail face charges related to
hallucinogenic drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more bullshit, they call cannabis a
hallucinogenic drug, which is right in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same category as probably LSD,
mushrooms, ecstasy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some cannabis, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny to think that over an invisible
line that this is now a hallucinogenic
[SPEAKER_00]: drug, and you cross this invisible line,
and now it's recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can cross another line,
and it's medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the time and place that we live in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is so amazing to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, where was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado officials have not yet responded
to any of the pending lawsuits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Previously, state attorneys have argued
that Colorado's more permissive marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: laws, both for medical and recreational
use and sales, do not amount to
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, they contend that marijuana
remains illegal in Colorado, aside from
[SPEAKER_00]: the specific exemptions allowed under the
medical and recreational laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Nebraska and Oklahoma filed their
lawsuit against Colorado last year,
[SPEAKER_00]: then Colorado Attorney General John
Suthers said in a statement that it
[SPEAKER_00]: appears the plaintiff's primary grievance
stems from a non-enforcement of federal
[SPEAKER_00]: laws regarding marijuana, as opposed to
choices made by the voters of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mason Tavert, one of the lead proponents
of Amendment 64, said if the lawsuits are
[SPEAKER_00]: successful in striking down the measure,
it would lead to a system of marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: chaos, which I would love to see what
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to see it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want it to happen, but it'd be
really neat to see how it's dealt with
[SPEAKER_00]: because there are dispensaries on every
other corner in Denver, every other corner
[SPEAKER_00]: in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo West has 12 or 15 dispensaries now
in that small community.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be hard to come clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'd have to go to California.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd have to go to every state that's
got medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They couldn't just come here because then
they'd be singling us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says this is just another case of the
arrest and prosecution industry teaming up
[SPEAKER_00]: with marijuana prohibition groups to roll
back the progress that has been made in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado, he said in a statement Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rep Jared Polis said in a statement that
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Justice and President Obama
have made clear that they will not
[SPEAKER_00]: interfere with the states whose citizens
voted for recreational marijuana use.
[SPEAKER_00]: This lawsuit is a silly attempt to
circumvent the will of Colorado voters and
[SPEAKER_00]: is a waste of time, Polis' statement says.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, these frivolous lawsuits
will likely continue until we pass my
[SPEAKER_00]: bipartisan Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol
Act and finally end the outdated federal
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these states have filed a suit and
they're trying to sue us to shut down our
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational marijuana program because
they can't get cannabis to stop coming
[SPEAKER_00]: into their states.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I said it the first time,
stop fucking with us and do what you can
[SPEAKER_00]: to make respectable, responsible cannabis
laws in Nebraska and Kansas and Oklahoma
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the states bordering those will
have to follow suit and then eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll just be a whole green map.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of having a red and blue map,
we'll start having all green states.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's another article that I keep
seeing pop up on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm finding this article on the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of my articles from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was written by Christopher Ingraham
from the Washington Post.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a cute little headline article
here or headline picture of a little bunny
[SPEAKER_00]: rabbit sitting on a digital scale and the
bunny weighs 93.2 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of cute.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline says, Utah DEA warns of
stoned rabbits if state passes medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: DEA warns of stoned rabbits if state
passes medical marijuana bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you take that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'll read the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Utah is considering a bill that would
allow patients with certain debilitating
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions to be treated with edible forms
of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the bill passes, the state's wildlife
may cultivate a taste for the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: lose their fear of humans, and basically
be high all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's according to testimony presented to
a Utah state panel last week by an agent
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Drug Enforcement Administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideal in facts, ideal in science,
said Special Agent Matt Fairbanks,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's been working in the state for a
decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a member of the marijuana
eradication team in Utah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of his colleagues in Georgia recently
achieved notoriety by raiding a retiree's
[SPEAKER_00]: garden and seizing a number of okra
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fairbanks spoke of his time eliminating
back country marijuana grows in the Utah
[SPEAKER_00]: mountains, specifically the environmental
costs associated with large scale weed
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation on public land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fairbanks said that at some illegal
marijuana grow sites, he saw rabbits that
[SPEAKER_00]: had cultivated a taste for the marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: He continued, It's true that illegal pot
farming can have harmful environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: consequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, nothing about these
consequences is unique to marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: If corn were outlawed, the cartels would
start growing it on national forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: The per plant environmental toll would be
about the same, which is kind of a neat
[SPEAKER_00]: fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back county marijuana grows are a
direct result of marijuana's illegal
[SPEAKER_00]: status.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're concerned about the
environmental impact of the grows,
[SPEAKER_00]: an alternative is to legalize and regulate
the plant so that people can grow it on
[SPEAKER_00]: farms and in their gardens rather than on
remote mountainsides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, regarding stone rabbits, some wild
animals apparently do develop a taste for
[SPEAKER_00]: bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know that the occasional high
rabbit constitutes for grounds for keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana prohibition in place any more
than drunk squirrels are an argument for
[SPEAKER_00]: outlawing alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's not even get started on the
nationwide epidemic of catnip abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a time not too long ago when
drug warriors terrified a nation with
[SPEAKER_00]: images of the devil's weed and reefer
madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it seems that enforcers of marijuana
law conjuring up a stoned bunny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not scary enough for the Utah state,
it seems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The panel approved the bill and sent it to
the full Senate where it will be debated
[SPEAKER_00]: this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, good luck to Utah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that this bill passes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that you're allowed to consume an
edible form of marijuana outlawing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in your state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the rabbits are going to get
stoned would be a lot like outlawing roads
[SPEAKER_00]: because dogs and squirrels are going to
get ran over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a stupid ass argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come up with something better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We aren't buying that bullshit anymore
because I've got one more news article
[SPEAKER_00]: that I want to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to wrap up the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is from the toke of the town,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will be the final news article
that I am ever going to read from the toke
[SPEAKER_00]: of the town.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will tell you why this article comes
from the toke of the town.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says, after five years,
toke of the town says goodbye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since 2009, toke of the town has brought
you the biggest marijuana news and the
[SPEAKER_00]: loudest pop views from across the country
and around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along the way, we've covered the huge
progress many states have made toward
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization and wondered why others are
so far behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: This country still has a long way to go,
but things are looking up and we have our
[SPEAKER_00]: fingers crossed that 2015 will be another
big year for legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the toke won't be around to see it,
at least not in its present form.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the toke of the town's final day
of publication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was actually written at the end
of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry, we're not quitting the
movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just returning the focus of our
marijuana coverage to our local voice
[SPEAKER_00]: media group papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still read William Breed's weekly
pot reviews and ask a stoner column at
[SPEAKER_00]: westward.com where they started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can continue to follow him on
Twitter and on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can keep following toke on
Facebook and Twitter too for the latest
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana news from all of our papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many thanks for reading and supporting us
for the past five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't have covered the marijuana
community without such a strong one
[SPEAKER_00]: reading us, though the community itself is
a strong one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thrown off by the way they worded
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of our archives will remain online
because we wouldn't want you to lose
[SPEAKER_00]: access to our serious reporting on issues
of medicine and our lighthearted coverage
[SPEAKER_00]: of stoner movies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light went up for us, won't you?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a little outdated because this
was put out at the end of the year,
[SPEAKER_00]: the start of this year, at the end of last
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The toke of the town is not posting any
more news.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to pull a lot of news articles from
there, but I will not have them as a
[SPEAKER_00]: resource anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will miss you toke of the town.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were a great resource for my little
podcast here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You provided a lot of news articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do a dab for you later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll miss the toke of the town.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, that's enough news for
one episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to wrap up the show here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been about 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see how far we've been going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting good at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did 31 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even know how much time we'd
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's tease some next things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the Garden of Whedon will be here
on the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a phone interview planned.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a cat known as Soil Grown on
Instagram, Soil Grown is doing something
[SPEAKER_00]: he calls Rosentek.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't seen that, we'll talk about
that a little bit on the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Garden of Whedon will be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about canopy
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends, Greenworks,
who got us started on this canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: management project.
[SPEAKER_00]: On an upcoming episode, we will have
Turpex and Hunt from the Grammy Gatsby to
[SPEAKER_00]: come talk about some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually going to Colorado Springs to
interview those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, big shout out to FastBerry.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, FastBerry on Instagram?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, you asked me a couple of questions
today on Instagram, and then you asked me
[SPEAKER_00]: if you were bothering me.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, dude, you're not bothering me at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that you listen to the podcast.

iReGenetics stuff on Instagram.
