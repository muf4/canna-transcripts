[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man We like to start off the podcast
by talking about what we are smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one should we tell them about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoked we've been sitting here dabbing
for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had it quite a smorgasbord We're
some spoiled brats.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're pushing a holiday up here in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to make anybody a
prohibition land cry Or let's do we smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: some blackberry banana kush ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was quite tasty We did a couple of
dabs of grape cola batter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was quite tasty That just it just
tastes like great Jolly Rancher and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think I I will agree with the grape Jolly
Ranchers It's just so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think my favorite was the
Malibu pure kush batter from Apothecary
[SPEAKER_00]: Farms That's got that just straight og
Tahoe kush sort of a flavor and we may
[SPEAKER_00]: have dabbed a couple of others,
but those are the ones That I'd oh we did
[SPEAKER_00]: hit the Tropicana cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the grapefruit really fruity
really tropical fruit one May have been
[SPEAKER_00]: the last one we hit so we have been taking
quite a few dabs over here We're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: into a little bit of a pre 420 celebration
in Colorado 420 pretty much starts the
[SPEAKER_00]: weekend before 24 420 Weekend before 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna edit that we're just gonna
leave that there cuz that was that's real
[SPEAKER_00]: 420 talk right there But it starts early
it starts the weekend before 420 then we
[SPEAKER_00]: have 420 is the actual weekend holiday
this year It happens to actually be on a
[SPEAKER_00]: week And I'm sure that will continue into
Monday and Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will see some smoke celebrations and
parties It will linger people are still in
[SPEAKER_00]: town having a good time, but we are
starting early All of the local
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries are having sales and I am
definitely taking advantage of those sales
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some green dot on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got this this for tzmo The label
says it is crescendo and HSB to the best
[SPEAKER_00]: of my knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is hash Man hash bar is what I think
that stands for and the package here says
[SPEAKER_00]: Octane and dumpster is the description on
the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes I've had a lot of fun shopping for
concentrates the past few days everywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: has got great sales A lot of the brands
have been holding back some of their their
[SPEAKER_00]: hit stuff for this week So it's been fun
going out and visiting dispensaries and
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing what's available recreational and
medical shops have a bunch of great stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: right now It's been really nice shelves
are loaded up across the state and I
[SPEAKER_01]: really like green dots new packaging I can
lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just Aesthetically a pleasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the way they are putting the
Cross or the blend because it's not really
[SPEAKER_00]: across they didn't breed it But they took
two strains on this one It says that they
[SPEAKER_00]: put a chem dog number four and star dog in
here together And the description is guava
[SPEAKER_00]: juice and watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have some of that one in a minute
That's the copper cam later always one of
[SPEAKER_00]: my favorites on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They describe it as Tropical fruit
cocktail.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Mai Tai at Sunset Sherb and
purple punch Some delicious concentrates
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's face is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, why didn't we see those?
[SPEAKER_01]: None of this information was available
What a year ago?
[SPEAKER_01]: Two years ago, you wouldn't you wouldn't
get this on the packaging It certainly
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't standard and now it's it's becoming
commonplace and I just love it and on the
[SPEAKER_00]: back We've got the lab testing and all of
the other requirements here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 67% on that one 69% on this one the
stuff from apothecary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got different type of labeling Yeah,
I'm loving all of the descriptions and all
[SPEAKER_00]: the information what I don't like these
guys do it Okay, green dot and apothecary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do a really good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give you a jar with content
Concentrates in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some companies that give you way
too much stuff a box with a little feel
[SPEAKER_00]: for the Canadian with a little wrapper
with a little like Tissue paper with a
[SPEAKER_00]: little sticker in there with a dad who had
the size of bags Oh, we're not even gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: call out any names It was actually told
them I hated the fuzzy bags and they they
[SPEAKER_01]: took my advice and they stopped using it
good the the jar came in a Like a little
[SPEAKER_01]: pouch sort of like Crown Royal comes
that's what the bag the inside of the bag
[SPEAKER_01]: Like super fuzzy and linty and so when you
pull your jar concentrate out It was like
[SPEAKER_01]: cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the jars fuzzy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not at all appealing It looked
like the jar had just stringy hairs
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty unappealing once you opened
it But I told them I said hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: I love your absolutely love your
concentrates, but this sucks and I sent
[SPEAKER_00]: them a picture I was like this is what it
came out of the package looking like this
[SPEAKER_00]: is very unappealing I was like,
I know what's in here So I know this is
[SPEAKER_00]: fire and I know that it should be
represented better and they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh that is terrible and they stopped Doing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually messaged me and said thank
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was polite about it I was like this
sucks because constructive criticism
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take it as well Before we go too far.

[SPEAKER_00]: It is long.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several questions We're going to
read the intro and we will go through the
[SPEAKER_00]: list of questions And then when I feel
like the podcast has gotten satisfactory
[SPEAKER_00]: and my voice burns out and I've heard
enough of Mike We're going to wrap up this
[SPEAKER_01]: email and we may continue in a future
episode a two-parter maybe 419 and 421
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a three-parter maybe a one-parter
It's a hell of a even he's got a stack of
[SPEAKER_00]: pages over here There were images in here
that I took out and it's large font So it
[SPEAKER_00]: may look like more message than it
actually is now that I'm kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: unstacking the page multiple paragraphs
Yes, we got some some serious question in
[SPEAKER_01]: story time ahead of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's dive in You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I yeah I was gonna say I bet we could get
more done if we quit talking about how
[SPEAKER_00]: many pages there are and if we do Read the
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys if anybody wants to
send me an email My email address is grow
[SPEAKER_00]: from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to hear from you this Email goes
a lot like this Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope this email finds you well I
promised pictures of my arise grow a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of months ago, but I haven't had
the time to put together this email I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been listening to the podcast and tuning
into you on Instagram live for almost two
[SPEAKER_00]: years I've also been a patron of your
podcast on patreon for the past six months
[SPEAKER_00]: or so as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, man Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot for all the patreon support.

[SPEAKER_00]: I see your name up here and I have dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely Know your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where am I here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all the high quality
knowledge you spread on a daily basis Hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're very welcome dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you are improving your garden
with my knowledge I greatly appreciate
[SPEAKER_00]: what you do and possibly more importantly
how you do it You're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me also then he says
my main reason for writing is to share
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures from my arise grow a few months
back, but I also have a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: questions and suggestions that I've
thought of while listening to you and the
[SPEAKER_00]: DGC so I will dump a lot of those as At
the end first the pictures and some
[SPEAKER_00]: general information about my grow then he
includes several beautiful pictures of my
[SPEAKER_00]: strain arise You did a wonderful job.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that more privately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't show your pictures here So I don't
want to talk too much about them and
[SPEAKER_00]: abandon the people that are listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's keep going forward He talks about
his grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's growing in a 27 by 27 by 63 inch
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So This tall three feet tall nearly by
three feet wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming no it's three feet by three
feet Square by 63.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that five feet tall Mike 63 inches
five feet ish and then he's got an HLG 135
[SPEAKER_00]: a horticultural lighting group 135 LED in
there that sounds like enough light seven
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon air pots 70 30 mix of Fox Farms
ocean forest and perlite sounds like
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing a great job running the Fox
Farms trio with recharge We could do more
[SPEAKER_00]: with the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could give you a boost in there,
but the recharge is helping you out We may
[SPEAKER_00]: add a few things in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you listen, I've I've mixed up so much
Fox farms, it's it's not a bad soil to use
[SPEAKER_00]: if you that's what you're going for Oh,
he's got the soil, but he's using the the
[SPEAKER_00]: Fox Farms trio the three bottles for
feeding We could definitely do a little
[SPEAKER_00]: better than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure but we can we can move
forward from there That is a good starter
[SPEAKER_00]: setup, but we can improve from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're off to a great start He said this
was my third photo run my first run with
[SPEAKER_00]: your genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also ran autos twice Man,
I hope every girl you get a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: better He says overall I would rate it a
solid seven out of ten and as long as
[SPEAKER_00]: you're satisfied we are happy with you he
said It was the best crop I've had to date
[SPEAKER_00]: the buds looked great coming off the plant
But the temps and humidity were a bit out
[SPEAKER_00]: of whack during dry and cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that is always a struggle He says it
left the buds a little crispier than I
[SPEAKER_00]: would prefer as well as lowering overall
humidity Quality from a solid eight
[SPEAKER_00]: overall bud quality from a solid eight
borderline nine to a solid seven So you
[SPEAKER_00]: went from an eight and a half ish down to
a seven during the drying cure process?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a bad drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, how many grows and you say three?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the third growth That's not that's
not even uh, I mean you might notice it
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's you and it's yours and you
love it, but Like the friend that you
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke out with it isn't couldn't tell the
difference and as long as it's doing what
[SPEAKER_00]: you need Yeah, yeah, and you're only gonna
get better and man a eight out of a ten
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you made it a seven with your
trying here's a pain in the ass and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: so Tricky and there's so many little ins
and outs and this guy's probably got a job
[SPEAKER_00]: He can't sit there all day like we do and
stare at the jars and hope it It's time to
[SPEAKER_00]: open them.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can't do that kind of stuff probably
and that becomes that's when it really
[SPEAKER_01]: gets We know a couple of tricks to if you
want to bring some of that moisture
[SPEAKER_01]: content back and not have it taste like
Oh, we've talked a lot about that on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast the drying and curing episode
would really help this guy out Should we
[SPEAKER_00]: press pause and find out what number that
is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Mike check on your phone and find out
what drying and curing you keep reading I
[SPEAKER_00]: will check the thank you buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull that shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamie.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my Joe Rogan reference All right,
we're gonna keep moving here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on it says they smoked well and
everyone that I shared with came back for
[SPEAKER_00]: more so Just like Mike said your people
are gonna enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to smoke while taking care of
mundane household chores And this was a
[SPEAKER_01]: great strain just for that I've rise is
fucking great for chores.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Keep looking at Mike thinking he might
have the episode number.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I know the number but I don't want
to be wrong The original one was 36.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, there's a much more recent much
more recent one But I've got to go to the
[SPEAKER_01]: episode list and scroll down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be in the 380s or 390s based
off of your Rise podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe I had one of the sweet island
skunk phenotypes All right You got some
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet tropical flavors probably kind of
taller not as dense of buds as some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other phenotypes Would have liked to fill
out the net a little better, but this was
[SPEAKER_00]: my first time working with this cultivar
So I erred on the side of caution and
[SPEAKER_01]: flipped a little earlier than I should
have the dry and cure episode is 391 391
[SPEAKER_00]: there you go 391 drawing and curing 391
check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably heard it, but I just want
to make sure That you know that it is
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he says that he flipped a little bit
early But I mean, I'd rather you flip a
[SPEAKER_00]: little early than a little bit late early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he said for my next run I've got a
pack a five pack of pineapple wine and a
[SPEAKER_00]: five pack of your Hellfire OG That's gonna
be a fun grow the Hellfire OG will get a
[SPEAKER_00]: little stretchy on you The pineapple one
will keep up the pineapple one will stay
[SPEAKER_00]: tighter during the grow But it'll make
bigger buds that the Hellfire is gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch a little bit and make a bunch of
like golf ball sized rocks on it's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: be a completely different type of grow so
be Prepared for two different dance
[SPEAKER_00]: partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be a little bit of work,
but it will be fun Don't worry too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on and say gonna pop all of each
Looking to grow two plants in my new 36 by
[SPEAKER_00]: 48 inch tent and I've got a friend in
Vermont I start plants indoor for he'll
[SPEAKER_00]: take any additional females I have left
over after sexing man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you've got a solid game
plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm I like the pictures of the arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to see pictures of the
pineapple wine and Hellfire OG Now there
[SPEAKER_00]: is more to the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's off to a great start It says
questions and suggestions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the way he broke down this message
Here's where it gets gets to the questions
[SPEAKER_00]: and suggestions I've been considering
using some vacation time in the future to
[SPEAKER_00]: travel to one of the larger cannabis
industry events Events similar to the Endo
[SPEAKER_00]: Expo or the DGC Cup What are some of your
favorite event events you've been to over
[SPEAKER_00]: the years and what would you suggest for
someone not in the industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to consume on premises would be
one of the necessary caveats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would it be different for someone?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is only a consumer and not a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that one for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I would recommend the dude grows cup
It's the only event that I would recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: at this point is the DGC Cup Stay tuned to
this podcast and the dude grows cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be another event being talked
about right now It's being talked about by
[SPEAKER_01]: their donors.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple events around the
country like Seattle's hempfest There's a
[SPEAKER_01]: massive smokeout event over the 420
weekend in Vancouver Like clearly you
[SPEAKER_01]: missed it for this year But you might be
able to set up tickets and have a book of
[SPEAKER_01]: badass time for next year The Emerald Cup
seems to be a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people don't seem to have the best
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people say it's amazing Consumption
at the event is pretty rare In the legal
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis space right now The the whole
world is freaked out about more than three
[SPEAKER_01]: people getting getting together and
smoking pot at the same time and so
[SPEAKER_01]: finding a legal space Where a large
cannabis event with a real venue,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know where you can get some good
vending some food Lots of different booths
[SPEAKER_01]: for different parts of the industry All
the little tchotchke shit that comes with
[SPEAKER_01]: an event like that just to have that space
and consumption There's not a lot of good
[SPEAKER_00]: options right now Michigan is probably one
of your best places for that Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington, Michigan Oklahoma Those are
probably some of your best bets the places
[SPEAKER_00]: California they changed their rules
recently and they have really limited the
[SPEAKER_00]: Recreational smoking at events Colorado
basically shut it down You need to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: private party sort of a thing The way we
kind of are able to do it here There are
[SPEAKER_00]: very few venues that are known to let us
have consumption events We have to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: private party kind of a thing where we
invite you you have to be on a list It is
[SPEAKER_00]: done very carefully to where it's not open
to the public so to speak So there are
[SPEAKER_00]: some loopholes If you want to go to an
event where you can consume I would say
[SPEAKER_00]: Come to the dude grows cup also pay
attention for an event that may happen in
[SPEAKER_00]: July.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't make any promises I'm trying to
make this happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to make it happen It's a
bunch of stoners talking about it at this
[SPEAKER_00]: point But I'll see if I can dab these guys
into some motivation will make that happen
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan always puts on a great party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan has a great time Hempfest in
Seattle the Emerald Cup those are events
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can consume and you can meet a
lot of great people a lot of the high
[SPEAKER_00]: times events are great, but they are in
some states they aren't allowed to consume
[SPEAKER_00]: unless you're a medical smoker unless
you're In certain areas so the high times
[SPEAKER_00]: events are fun chalice is fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those events are great But make sure you
research if you can consume before you buy
[SPEAKER_00]: your tickets to go research the event
before you book yes and Always keep in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind that sometimes these events are
required to move venues Sometimes these
[SPEAKER_00]: events are canceled at the last minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't hate on the promoter the organizer
They do everything that they can to make
[SPEAKER_00]: these events happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's a struggle the last minute
the city says, you know what one of our
[SPEAKER_00]: guys just Threw a hissy fit we're gonna
change our mind on you last minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh uncle Bob back there through a fit the
whole family reunion is over Sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't get to go Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's stay on track a little bit because
this guy sent us a long email I would like
[SPEAKER_00]: to get through most of it This next
paragraph says I was thinking an episode
[SPEAKER_00]: on what to expect when entering a grow
contest or throwdown would be Informative
[SPEAKER_00]: for anyone thinking about dipping their
toes into that water Having just come from
[SPEAKER_00]: a grow off or a friendly community smoke
grow off type of event I feel a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: what contributed to Judging there was
mostly flavor when you've got a group of
[SPEAKER_00]: people judging an amount of product Which
is there were 50 entries if I had you
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke one rip off of 50 entries Would you
be able to tell me the difference after
[SPEAKER_00]: number 22?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's after a certain point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just baked and it's all flavor is
the right distinction So what I think one
[SPEAKER_00]: this cup was mostly based on flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's got a burn properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little Good in the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to have all the proper
Characteristics when you're in a
[SPEAKER_00]: competition, they all bring trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all trimmed properly They're all
dried and cured beautifully So what it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just the very subtle nuances if you've got
those very beautiful flavors if it burns
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly Those are the things it's got to
be 100% perfection So he said what to
[SPEAKER_00]: expect when entering as anyone thinking
about dipping their toes in you've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: do everything perfectly trim it to where
it looks like it is On the cover of a
[SPEAKER_01]: magazine that I can't be stressed enough
folks trim your fucking herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah ugly herb I look right past it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go they were too lazy to trim it
properly They probably didn't do the rest
[SPEAKER_00]: of the process properly It probably tastes
like shit because there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll in it because look at all that
leaf material It's a turnoff right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trim it properly Dry it and cure it a
lot of product looked really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You went to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was too damp It was too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just wasn't right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could tell that it was quick dried.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just burned up a little bit weird Flush
Flush before harvest flushing is free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please flush your plants It's so essential
if you're gonna try to compete you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: flush your yes you When you're smoking 10
or 15 strains in a row and number eight
[SPEAKER_01]: tastes like fucking worm castings It ain't
gonna win.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell like I said earlier We're
going for flavor a lot of it is flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: once you've smoked 50 samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get much higher You're already
peeked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your lungs are burnt out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to stand out and flavor is what's
going to make it do it unless You hit one
[SPEAKER_00]: that really just puts you on your ass Then
you go Oh that one might be special and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you're gonna have to taste that one
again in a minute to see Does it taste
[SPEAKER_00]: really good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it potent because there are a lot of
great things in there The ones that taste
[SPEAKER_00]: best are the ones you're gonna you're
gonna remember the most And after you body
[SPEAKER_00]: is so saturated if I watch people there
their eyes were red Like we smoked from 4
[SPEAKER_00]: o 'clock until 11 o'clock at night in that
place judging these products like we
[SPEAKER_00]: people were lit So if you're gonna enter
make it think about it like you were
[SPEAKER_00]: putting It under a microscope and you were
handing it to the best smokers and growers
[SPEAKER_00]: on the planet because it is going to be
scrutinized It is going to be judged.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the point you want it judged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you didn't do anything wrong And
don't be afraid to lose because everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: else entered the same way the same
attitude that you did They brought their
[SPEAKER_00]: best so just be proud and have fun with
everybody and enjoy the competition It's
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the things you got to remember is
you're not doing this just for the trophy
[SPEAKER_01]: do it to have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a big part of it and for the
passion just to just to be a part of it
[SPEAKER_01]: the The just the concept of the judge
having a day or three days to smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: through You know all those herb samples
and all those concentrate samples like I
[SPEAKER_01]: remember reading stuff about this in high
times back 15 20 years when they talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about the cup in Amsterdam and just how
overwhelming it would be for the judges to
[SPEAKER_01]: just like they have fucking homework
notebooks full of shit and trying to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: the sample straight and It's a lot of work
on the judges folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to remember that piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one more piece Well, actually
what's fun about the dude grows cup is
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's a judge everybody that enters
get five it gets five tokens And then once
[SPEAKER_00]: you smoke my boats, yeah, you get five
votes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put those wherever you want Yeah,
I thought that was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody that paid money to have a
ticket was considered a judge So we all
[SPEAKER_00]: got to try it another thing I want to add
on to this and this will be my last part
[SPEAKER_00]: about this about if you're trying to enter
Don't enter a big old giant donkey dick
[SPEAKER_00]: bud and don't enter a bunch of crappy
fucking kibbles Enter some decent sized
[SPEAKER_00]: bag of peel buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most places want approximately an ounce
Give us like a few nice nuggets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give us one fat ounce bud Don't give
us a bunch of shake and crap show us give
[SPEAKER_00]: us a bag that can be divided up amongst
like 28 judges if you got an ounce give me
[SPEAKER_01]: like 28 gram buds would be awesome like To
a gram size now is what you're looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that we can we can share it we
can all enjoy it and look at it and
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody can get a little Visual of it we
can see what the texture the colors the
[SPEAKER_00]: aromas the bag appeal all of that matters
to me because if you've got 22 different
[SPEAKER_00]: jars of bud the visual is a big part of it
and like I said once we've smoked 20 or 30
[SPEAKER_00]: jars I don't it's that visual is gonna
matter because the potency doesn't matter
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore the visual the aroma and the taste
That's what's gonna get me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I've rambled along about
that one for a long time Let's move to the
[SPEAKER_00]: next question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a whole episode worth of questions
I like it how often should my exhaust Fan
[SPEAKER_00]: kick on I run a carbon filter attached to
my fan in the tent For the previous setup
[SPEAKER_00]: and I felt like it the smell suffer due to
the constant scrubbing I have configured
[SPEAKER_00]: my setup to where the fan and the filter
are outside the tent But now wondering how
[SPEAKER_00]: often I should be running refreshing my
air in my tent I have it have the setup
[SPEAKER_00]: currently running 15 minutes every four
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um The first thing that caught my
attention and Mike nodded at me also the
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon filter did not Mess with the I
think he's saying that it messed with the
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma the smell suffered So I think he's
saying a mess with the aroma of the final
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shouldn't yeah, that's not if that's
not possible That's not a thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon filter did not did not do like it's
not sucking terpenes out of the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that is not a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So The other red the first red flag for me
was that a that's not a thing in what's
[SPEAKER_01]: your humidity doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was going to say He's
running it every 15 minutes or 15 minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: for every four hours I would do it a
little more frequently Probably once every
[SPEAKER_00]: hour, but I would just pay attention to
the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it like in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a way to monitor the humidity?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get a spike when the
lights go off You've got all that water in
[SPEAKER_00]: the air because the lights have been
creating heat all the water is evaporated
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to turn off the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your humidity is going to spike and then
it's going to drop You're gonna get a few
[SPEAKER_00]: movements and then when the lights come
back on it's gonna do weird things also So
[SPEAKER_00]: how are you able to monitor that?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you can see what's happening in
there, you'll know better how to adjust
[SPEAKER_00]: your your exhaust you may need a
dehumidifier also if you've got too much
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity in there, but I would get
something that can monitor the VPD I would
[SPEAKER_00]: grab something like a PL grow monitor and
put that in there and that way you can
[SPEAKER_00]: check on your phone at any time you can
see what the VPD of that grow room is you
[SPEAKER_00]: can see when it is necessary to recycle
the air in that tent Like I would
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely go like 15 minutes an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah 15 minutes every hour at least
refresh the air at least refresh it that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to increase your co2 It's going to
just refresh the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to help with your humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think One time every hour, maybe just 10
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, there's no reason to turn it off
I was just about to say most of the setups
[SPEAKER_01]: I've helped design and build for in-home
production Just had an on and an off and
[SPEAKER_01]: they just ran forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah the way I do mine so I run a
different different couple of Setups when
[SPEAKER_00]: I have tents the way that I have a tent
set up right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got a carbon filter It is sitting
on a cinder block in the corner because it
[SPEAKER_00]: is honestly too heavy to hang in that room
I would rather hang it in the tent,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it won't hang it's heavy So it is on a
cinder block and it is upright then the
[SPEAKER_00]: duct comes off of that it goes over the
light Which is a light hood with glass so
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm sealed up then it goes up to an
exhaust fan the exhaust Sits on top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: hut outside of the hut and it sucks the
air through the carbon filter sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: right there right suck Yeah pulling so I'm
blowing the air through the carbon filter
[SPEAKER_00]: over the light and then up out of the
blower out of the tent and it blows it
[SPEAKER_00]: into the room and that room has enough
circulation of air and What's the room
[SPEAKER_00]: central air cooling in that room to where
I don't have to worry about it getting
[SPEAKER_00]: stale in there I just leave that room open
and it works with the rest of the house So
[SPEAKER_00]: what works is when I zip it up all those
passive ducts at the bottom of the tent
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the grow huts and grow tents have
Passive vents at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I just unvelcro those I pull in
enough fresh air through the bottom right
[SPEAKER_00]: there and it just sucks all my stale air
right out of that tent and I've got a six
[SPEAKER_00]: inch blower on a five by five tent and
when I zip it up it caves in it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: like crush in but you can tell it sucks in
pretty well so I'm getting plenty of
[SPEAKER_00]: airflow by the size of your tent if you've
got a big enough fan just to You don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want it to cave in you want to see it like
kind of billow in just a little bit It's
[SPEAKER_00]: not gonna crush but you can tell it's
creating some pressure You know that you
[SPEAKER_00]: were evacuating out enough air and
replacing enough air to where it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: getting stale and that carbon Filter is
not going to deplete the smell of your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put that back in the tent is what
I would do Alright, so I want to move into
[SPEAKER_00]: the next paragraph.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm right here He says for your patreon
campaign, you may want to consider putting
[SPEAKER_00]: a select your own donation amount button I
was fully planning on donating 10 bucks a
[SPEAKER_00]: month when I first signed up but I was
limited to the preset options of 420 710
[SPEAKER_00]: etc And I chose 710 instead of the full
$10 as I had planned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I just ripped myself off for a good
tip $2.90 Yeah, he said you might be
[SPEAKER_00]: limiting what you bring in monthly due to
your limited donation options.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible It's always possible that
patreon does not support this option as
[SPEAKER_00]: well You know, I don't remember seeing the
add your own thing button.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I may want to add a dollar and ten
bucks I may want to go add a few more
[SPEAKER_00]: tiers so that people can help out at
different levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that That may be a million
dollar tip right there You never know in
[SPEAKER_01]: the long run if it's a million dollar tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to start talking about pay well
anyway We're gonna move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one There's a couple of more
things on here, but I think we can cover
[SPEAKER_00]: it all in this one This next paragraph is
going to be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says let's talk about bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Have on rare occasions ran across seeded
buds from the medical dispensaries in my
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that happens Should I even consider
growing these out?
[SPEAKER_00]: My main concern is that the pollen would
have potentially been from a hermaphrodite
[SPEAKER_00]: leading to these seeds to similarly her
Can I be sure that the seed is a
[SPEAKER_00]: representative?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of what was in the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: My main concern is that it was cross
pollinated leading to potentially unstable
[SPEAKER_00]: or unpredictable genetics My gross base is
limited and this seems like a bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: gamble your thoughts either way would be
appreciated This is a fun one Those seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: could have come from anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have been a It wasn't a male
plant chances are pretty good that the
[SPEAKER_01]: herb you've got in the bag is at least
half the genetics of those Seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's really all you've got right,
right So the the herb that you bought the
[SPEAKER_00]: label if it says blue dream or whatever
you got Yes, that seed is going to be from
[SPEAKER_00]: a blue dream female but at least 50% But
where that the male part came from it
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't a male It probably was not a male
most the dispensary growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pull a male way before that We don't
even have seeds in the grow most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: time It's all clones that have been passed
around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no opportunity for a male It
was probably another plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodite it or what is possible and
this does happen when a plant becomes Too
[SPEAKER_00]: stressed or it has a light leak if one
section of the plant is exposed to light
[SPEAKER_00]: quite often in a commercial environment
There'd be a doorway right by the doorway
[SPEAKER_00]: where the two doors closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's that little little tiny gap You'll
get a little section of seeded buds right
[SPEAKER_00]: there and the plants don't herm from it,
but they just stress seed They'll make a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of seeds in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may have seeds like that It is hard
to predict what you've got most likely it
[SPEAKER_00]: is a stress seed caused by a light leak in
a commercial facility Maybe they overfed
[SPEAKER_00]: it and it's stressed if you grow that you
could have the most amazing Shit on the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet or you could have the biggest
problem on the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is hard to predict Right some some hurt
or some little mutant seeds come out like
[SPEAKER_00]: Wolverine and some come out like sloth
Chem 91 and all of the chem dog strains
[SPEAKER_00]: were an accident Girl scout cookies in my
theory was an accident gorilla glue number
[SPEAKER_00]: four was an accident Golden goat was an
accident many of the super popular crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have got that we are using that
were really popular for a while were
[SPEAKER_00]: Accidents those seeds that are in that bag
are accidents Sometimes when you look back
[SPEAKER_00]: at genetics of some of the really popular
if you look back at the lineage of really
[SPEAKER_00]: popular genetics You see in the family
tree it will say unknown bag seed and a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of them Because somebody just doesn't
know what that was and back in the day We
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have seed banks and breeders to
order a shit ton of seeds from so if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a killer seed You grew it you
wanted to see what it was and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people started a lot of good breeding
projects with unknown bag seed So you may
[SPEAKER_00]: have it's kind of like a you've got a pack
of baseball cards right there you could
[SPEAKER_01]: have a This is where the analogy falls
apart or sports enough to name someone
[SPEAKER_00]: current or you could have the other one
you can have a Mickey Mantle or you could
[SPEAKER_00]: have a Fucking yeah, exactly.
Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have the gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Yeah, who knows which one you've got
um All of the chem dog lineage that all
[SPEAKER_00]: comes from bag seed that came from if you
have not already if you are a chem
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis aficionado a consumer if you were
into cannabis and you want to be part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the community Fun little piece of can of
history you need to read chem dog and the
[SPEAKER_00]: legend of the 13 beans That is really
important that you read that all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds were bag seed and that is where the
further Generations of chem dog from the
[SPEAKER_01]: dog bud came like half the good weed of
like the 2005 to 2010 came from that shit
[SPEAKER_01]: 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah on yeah 91 on yeah, see see how that
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep But uh, yeah, so what you who knows
which You've got there me being fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never want to go back that far if it's
part of deadhead culture and cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: culture So it collides into two of my
favorite worlds if you have got extra
[SPEAKER_00]: space Grow that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have extra space,
maybe don't grow it out Maybe save that or
[SPEAKER_00]: pass it on to a friend that's got extra
space I'm not sure what you've got when
[SPEAKER_00]: you grow it sprout the seed get it big
enough to take a clone get a clone of it
[SPEAKER_00]: either flower out that original seedling
or flower out the clone and see what
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got if it's amazing you've got a
keeper of it back there with that clone or
[SPEAKER_00]: that original Plant if it's crap,
then you've got another crap plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to throw away But the only way to
really find out is to grow it the world
[SPEAKER_00]: needs nickel fits to buddy That's that's
the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have you could have the next
Mickey Mantle card right there Or you
[SPEAKER_00]: could have the gum from the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to guess it's hard to predict
What strain did it come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably came from quality bud because
you bought it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably the best on the shelf
that day They got your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may get that you may get nothing
like most of the seeds I get in dispensary
[SPEAKER_01]: herb are are pretty clearly stressed seed
Yeah, those light leaks are a motherfucker
[SPEAKER_01]: and you cannot make owners understand
simple shit like a pinhole can ruin a room
[SPEAKER_00]: I think our friend uncle Joey would say
take a chance Columbus did And I would say
[SPEAKER_00]: grow it cuz I'm curious what's in there
I'd want to know especially if you are on
[SPEAKER_01]: bag seed, too It's just hard with the
number limitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I was gonna say you're limited
on space, but you're probably also limited
[SPEAKER_00]: on genetic availability I don't know what
you're growing for if you're growing for
[SPEAKER_00]: your own Personal medicine and you've got
something that works stick to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't change it If it ain't broke don't
fix it But if you are growing and it is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to the market and this is becoming
profitable if you grow that seed You've
[SPEAKER_00]: got something nobody else has it is
unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've instantly set yourself apart from
the market So if you've got the new thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you want to call it, let's make
up a name I don't know the fucking red
[SPEAKER_00]: golden green rasta flag.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's right in front of me So it
was really easy if you're the only one
[SPEAKER_00]: with that and it's the new fire in town
Everyone's gonna be talking about the red
[SPEAKER_00]: golden green rasta Flag strain and you're
the only one with it They got to go to you
[SPEAKER_00]: to get that and that's always helpful if
that is your approach to cannabis So
[SPEAKER_00]: that's my insight into that one I I can't
really give you any better advice on
[SPEAKER_00]: what's in that seed because it is like you
said unpredictable Potentially unstable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also possibly the fucking champ you could
have Michael Jordan in there and you never
[SPEAKER_00]: know So the email keeps going he says be
lower a couple of pictures of a prototype
[SPEAKER_00]: cure jar with the lid built in I Been
working on actually I've seen these from
[SPEAKER_00]: another person I'm not sure if that's you
but I've gotten some of these and they
[SPEAKER_00]: work very well It's a mason jar with a
hygrometer lid inside of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can yes, I've gotten some of those
from another person I don't think that
[SPEAKER_00]: that was you I'm using them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work marvelously They tell you
exactly the temperature and humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: inside that jar so you can see how moist
or how dry your product is You know when
[SPEAKER_00]: to crack it open, you know how long to
leave it open It is beautiful if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: making those along with the other person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great product My voice is burning
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Submit a patent There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The patent race is on because I know two
people making this product now So when you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys has to get a patent and then one of
you has to get a cease and desist letter
[SPEAKER_00]: going No, I'm just getting become friends
and then make a really great company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Loser the first race does the fucking 30
gallon buckets There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The five gallon buckets with hygrometer
lids Lowe's buckets with hygrometer lids
[SPEAKER_01]: to go the 30 gallon plastic pop off lids
the sweater buckets Oh, yeah, those are
[SPEAKER_01]: much easier to work with do fuck spinning
those five gallon lids off Do my knuckles
[SPEAKER_01]: hurt just thinking about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I remember opening buckets.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was way too many buckets We're gonna
continue with this guy's email.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next paragraph of this email goes like
this I unfortunately do not have any
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures of the bottom with me currently
if you're interested in seeing more I
