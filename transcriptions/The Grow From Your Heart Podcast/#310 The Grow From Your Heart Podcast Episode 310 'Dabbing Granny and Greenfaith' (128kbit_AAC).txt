[SPEAKER_03]: dab rig because it's time for another
episode of the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_03]: Podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for episode 310 of the Grow From
Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_03]: This episode was a lot of fun to record.
[SPEAKER_03]: For this episode, I took white mic up to
Colorado Springs, and we went to the Green
[SPEAKER_03]: Faith Ministries Cannabis Church,
and we were joined by Dab and Granny,
[SPEAKER_03]: Reverend Brandon Baker, and a dude who
calls himself I Rock Watts.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, I don't want to ramble on too
long in this intro, so let's just get
[SPEAKER_03]: right to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ladies and gentlemen, Dab and Granny,
White Mike, I Rock Watts, Reverend Brandon
[SPEAKER_03]: Baker, and myself at the Green Faith
Ministries Cannabis Church.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Podcast World, we are here live
at Green Faith Ministries in Colorado
[SPEAKER_03]: Springs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm joined on microphone by the always
beautiful Dab and Granny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the show, sweetheart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for having me, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for putting this together for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're at a pretty cool place.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of impressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We walked in, a young lady checked my ID.
[SPEAKER_03]: She told me to have a good time,
and I am set up recording a podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had about 37 dabs, smoked some insert
dabs, I smoked some hot nail dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a great place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for introducing me to this place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm meeting the Rev for the first
time myself, so... Well, then let's
[SPEAKER_03]: introduce the Rev to the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ladies and gentlemen, joining us on
microphone number three over there is the
[SPEAKER_03]: Rev.
[SPEAKER_03]: They call him Rev Brandon Baker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for joining me on the show,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for inviting me to your church.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you like to take a second and tell
my audience about the church?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a cannabis sacrament church,
all denominational instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: non-denominational.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it sounds better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rastafarian-based, believe cannabis is the
healing of the nation's tree life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our mission is to get all other
churches, no matter their path or faith,
[SPEAKER_00]: to believe that whatever their God is,
that cannabis is the holy healing
[SPEAKER_00]: sacrament put here by him or her.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rastafarian.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thanks for representing cannabis for
us and having a place where we can consume
[SPEAKER_03]: safely and not feel like we're in any
danger.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm totally comfortable here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and secure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad to have you here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll definitely be back here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, on the microphone, a repeat offender
I brought him all the way to Colorado
[SPEAKER_03]: Springs.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got him out of the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ladies and gentlemen, White Mike is on the
show with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for taking some time away from the
family to come be on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to get out once every six
months, get out to this place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is a good time here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel I'm dabbed out and I'm hanging out
with a bunch of new friends and old
[SPEAKER_03]: friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right here on Constitution and Academy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a social media page for this
place?
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Faith Supply Company on Facebook is
pretty much our main thing where we keep
[SPEAKER_00]: people updated daily.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check them out, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're 21 and over and you're not an
asshole, you can come here and you can
[SPEAKER_03]: participate in the church.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can be part of the crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really cool vibe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's here is super friendly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I asked for an extension cord.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took off running for an extension cord.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have emails.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have everything here to Medicaid.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything is on a donation basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what we do is people, regular
donating members, we give them reward
[SPEAKER_00]: points to cash in for church merchandise,
whether it be sacraments or pipes,
[SPEAKER_00]: shirts, drinks, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the artwork on the wall.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the Native American vibe painting
in front of me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of great color.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super chill vibe.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just noticed the people in the clouds.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is super cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great painting in front of me behind me as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice Indian smoking a peace pipe there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super cool vibe.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not too hippied out, which is
something that I like.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of places over hippify the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's super chill here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All hand painted by a patron, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you give them a shout out?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can say their name if you'd like on
the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, iRock.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just Uncle Steve.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uncle Steve did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Uncle Steve.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uncle Steve is a savage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great painting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Much respect.
[SPEAKER_03]: That guy that just jumped in is a guy
called iRockWatts on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check him out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Troll him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He'll troll you back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_03]: He may jump in once in a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said he didn't want to be on the show,
but I knew he'd change his mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got him already.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's podcast adjacent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Three minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got him in.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's just chilling out.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's keeping the dab nail hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's keeping us going.
[SPEAKER_03]: So welcome to the show, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we've introduced everybody
properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: White Mike's here.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Reverend's here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Granny's here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Josh is here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all hanging out, getting red-eyed,
getting iry, getting medicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Granny, we wanted to talk about some of
your adventures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start with your injury.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's two injuries, though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two of them.
Well.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first one was in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you notice, my glasses are all
womp-eyed on my face.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was trying not to pay too much attention
to your injuries.
[SPEAKER_05]: It hurts my feelings, so I wasn't paying
too much attention.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I can laugh at myself because I've
always said I'm a hazard to myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Michigan.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was so cold.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, it was freezing cold.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was colder than Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to this Ash Bash Cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we couldn't park close.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I got out, and I'm running.
[SPEAKER_05]: And guys, if you know me, I am an Amazon.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I'm running, there's a lot of force.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I look out of my eye, and I see the
door is open to my left.
[SPEAKER_05]: I look in front of me, and the door is
open.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thump.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bounce.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right off a huge plate glass window.
[SPEAKER_05]: My glasses went flat.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's people all around.
[SPEAKER_05]: The only person is Mama Bear Dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: She ran up to me, and she was like,
oh, I'm so glad that was you because I
[SPEAKER_05]: would have done the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: We go in.
[SPEAKER_05]: I fix my glasses.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not injured too badly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Had some bruises.
[SPEAKER_05]: We go in.
[SPEAKER_05]: We party.
[SPEAKER_05]: We come back out.
[SPEAKER_05]: The party.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody goes, oh my God, Gail,
there's your face on the window.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hit that plate glass window so hard that
I left my entire face bruised.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your whole face.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lips and nose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a pillow in the morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to hear about my second injury?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you OK from the first one?
[SPEAKER_01]: So lasting damage from the first one,
just pride or stitches?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank God that window didn't break.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you actually heard thump because I was
running so fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was your pride hitting the window.
[SPEAKER_05]: I bounced probably two feet back off that
window.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how hard I hit it.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Michigan, that was the Michigan injury.
[SPEAKER_05]: We go to DC last weekend.
[SPEAKER_05]: A week after my Michigan injuries,
Kevin and I decide to go exploring.
[SPEAKER_05]: No problem, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: Navigation.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your phone?
[SPEAKER_05]: We got GPS.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got a good phone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Forgot to check the battery life of the
phone.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're 20 minutes in.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went into the walk, have no idea where
we're at.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have 1% battery power.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, oh, Kevin, we're fucked.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know where we're at.
[SPEAKER_05]: He goes, hurry up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Find long term on your phone where we got
to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking at my phone, not at my feet.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a big tree thing that grew up
into the sidewalk.
[SPEAKER_05]: I literally bounced my lip up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, my glasses went flying.
[SPEAKER_05]: This time I injured my hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one I kind of sprained my hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I knew it was bad because Kevin come
running and he said, are you okay?
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, I am.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he said, well, you should have
been watching your feet.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, I'm trying to figure out where the
hell we're at.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're staying in the Airbnb.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a really great story.
[SPEAKER_05]: Should I tell the great story?
[SPEAKER_05]: Out of my injuries, something really good
came.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are lost as can be.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are lost as can be.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know how we're going to get
back to the Airbnb.
[SPEAKER_05]: Phone's dead.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm looking around and I'm not getting
a vibe that I can ask you, how do I get
[SPEAKER_05]: back to my place?
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally, I see a young urban professional,
probably early thirties with a baby on his
[SPEAKER_05]: back.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I say, I hate to bother you,
but I am so lost.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you help me?
[SPEAKER_05]: And he says, I will walk you as far as my
brownstone and then I'll tell you how.
[SPEAKER_05]: To get from there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very nice young man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Five minutes into the walk, he goes,
I can't help but notice your earrings.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's got pot leaf earrings, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, yeah, I guess is the earrings
worth the only cannabis related item of
[SPEAKER_01]: clothing you had on at the moment?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think probably the only thing you could
really see.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had like a vest on because it was kind
of chilly there in D.C.
[SPEAKER_05]: as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was no, there was no pot,
nothing visible like I usually have on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing glass or anything, but these were
visible.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, yes, I'm a marijuana advocate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he says, I don't like this whole
legalization thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, you got the perfect lady right
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, I'm kind of known for talking
a lot of bullshit about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we get talking.
[SPEAKER_05]: I learned quite a bit about this young
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I learned.
[SPEAKER_05]: His father is a cardiologist.
[SPEAKER_05]: His brother is a surgeon in one of the
branches of the military.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is a financial planner.
[SPEAKER_05]: His wife is a CEO of a company.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're not there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're frightened about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cartels are going to come in and
everything stereotypical is what he is
[SPEAKER_05]: frightened about.
[SPEAKER_05]: We get to his brownstone and he's asked me
questions about how I feel about
[SPEAKER_05]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I say, for a family like yourself,
legalization is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Colorado, it's track, seed to sale.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no funny business going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got to his brownstone and he says,
I'm enjoying our conversation so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to walk you to your Airbnb.
[SPEAKER_05]: I flipped him.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did flip him.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: By the time we got to the Airbnb,
he was convinced.
[SPEAKER_05]: I told him Kevin's story.
[SPEAKER_05]: I told him, I said, you know, I really
like you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to say his name,
although I did know it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, what makes Kevin and I sitting
down and smoking a joint or me doing a
[SPEAKER_05]: dab?
[SPEAKER_05]: What makes that any different than you and
your wife consuming a glass of wine when
[SPEAKER_05]: your children are in bed?
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, I bet you do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't you?
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said, I never thought about it that
way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And most people don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he told me he's not so frightened now
about legalization and that maybe
[SPEAKER_05]: controlled marijuana is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You brought him to the green side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think he's going to go talk to his
parents who are educated and teach them
[SPEAKER_03]: about cannabis also?
[SPEAKER_05]: He's going to go a step farther.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said he would talk to people in the
financial institutions around there to see
[SPEAKER_05]: what is the, what is the reason we can't
work with reputable cannabis companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, Kevin says, Gail, you know,
you, as much as a goofball as I am,
[SPEAKER_05]: and you all know I am a goofball when I
need to be, I can be articulate and I can
[SPEAKER_05]: be personable.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think, I think maybe that was my
whole mission there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just that one interaction.
[SPEAKER_05]: That one interaction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes worse than places just to be
that angel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I knew the next day would all be a
bunch of people like us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody medicated.
[SPEAKER_05]: My word wasn't going to meet anything
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you're changing cannabis there right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe he's putting something into action.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're getting a bank going and they
won't have the struggles that we have here
[SPEAKER_03]: in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love, I would love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your little angel moment that you provided
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was like that, that was my big
moment from WDC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm sorry that you hurt yourself,
but I'm glad you were able to spread some
[SPEAKER_03]: knowledge and turn some people onto our
side.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you for doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to keep going with stories or
do you want to?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me ask Mike.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike here, he knows a lot about the laws.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is what I would say your biggest part
of the industry is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the part of the industry that I
have locked down more than anyone else I
[SPEAKER_01]: know.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we call him white Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the guy that follows the rules.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he does follow the rules and he knows
what the rules are.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I'm trying to do something,
when I'm getting a little too out of hand,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to break three rules at once.
[SPEAKER_03]: Michael say, break one law at a time,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's literally the best advice I've ever
been given is if you're going to break a
[SPEAKER_01]: rule or a law, break one rule or law at a
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: This morning when young kids were asking
me about, you know, the weekend and doing
[SPEAKER_05]: this or that, I was like, the best advice
I could give you is do one illegal thing,
[SPEAKER_05]: one stupid thing at a time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't be doing all kinds of dumb shit at
once.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's when you start combo and shit up that
all the shenanigans really get out of
[SPEAKER_01]: hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody needs a friend like Mike
around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you got to have a guy to pull
the reins and go, hey, you're going
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just need a guy to remind you that
you're slipping up, especially some of us
[SPEAKER_05]: that are very impulsive.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't think long term.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I am.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one of my concerns is people say that I
do a lot of boneheaded things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of them, they think I'm terrible
for being so transparent, traveling from
[SPEAKER_05]: state legal state to legal state with,
as I say, my medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a real, real gray area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically you're putting yourself at
the mercy of every law enforcement agency
[SPEAKER_01]: whose jurisdiction you happen to travel
through on the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just because the TSA in Denver
doesn't give a shit doesn't mean that a
[SPEAKER_01]: stewardess won't radio ahead and have the
local PD for wherever your land landing
[SPEAKER_01]: ruin your trip.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good bit of advice there.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's from legal state to legal state
or medical state to medical state,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're lowering lowering your odds of
having a shitty trip when you land and
[SPEAKER_01]: having law enforcement waiting to ruin
your day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now, as far as I can recall,
there's only one state with what they call
[SPEAKER_01]: reciprocity, meaning they consider your
state's medical marijuana card is valid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's Nevada.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they don't say explicitly that it's
kosher to fly into Nevada with a product
[SPEAKER_01]: you picked up in another legal state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's an incredibly gray, very close to
the illegal side of the line.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they want to get technical,
you are transporting narcotics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Across state lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: The feds don't care unless it's enough to
distribute them.
[SPEAKER_05]: That seems to be more of the issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: TSA will tell me their mission is more
bombs and things that are going to hurt
[SPEAKER_05]: other passengers.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't hurt somebody with it right
now, TSA doesn't have time to care.
[SPEAKER_05]: Metro in Vegas, because I've pushed it to
the limits.
[SPEAKER_05]: They told me what I bring is nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Leave me alone.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are looking for people that are
transporting large amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trafficking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one business right now in Alaska.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their production facility and one of their
shops are what we would consider half the
[SPEAKER_01]: country away, because it's in Alaska.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one side of the state can be days
travel from the other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're flying product back and forth
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a major news story that comes up
every two months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another news outlet will hear about it and
go, holy shit, they're putting weed on a
[SPEAKER_01]: plane?
[SPEAKER_03]: But in Alaska, those little jumper planes
are like driving a bus from Springs to
[SPEAKER_03]: Denver.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's such a rural place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's so far apart that this is normal
for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They drive to the plane.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get on the plane.
[SPEAKER_03]: They drive to the other landing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get in the other truck and drive that
to their spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just what they do in Alaska.
[SPEAKER_05]: But don't you think as advocates or
activists, sometimes we do have to push
[SPEAKER_05]: things in those gray areas?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I will say, why do I have to
follow the rules when they're not even
[SPEAKER_05]: concrete all the time?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the change comes from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how we end up with actual
rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like right now, you can take booze on a
plane, I think, if you follow very
[SPEAKER_01]: specific rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll sell it to you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can't open it on the plane.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to follow very specific rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you're drunk at altitude,
all sorts of crazy shit happens because
[SPEAKER_01]: there's not enough oxygen in your blood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they'll boot you off the plane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they won't let you board if they
think you're drunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so far, we haven't had anybody freak
out up in the air on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please keep that streak going,
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: As advocates or activists or whatever
you'd like to be, like to title us,
[SPEAKER_03]: is it our responsibility to follow the
rules and play fair so we don't fuck it
[SPEAKER_03]: up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is it our responsibility to push the
limit so that things change the way we
[SPEAKER_03]: need it?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's both.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that why there's a white mic version of
activism, the dab and granny version of
[SPEAKER_03]: activism, the revs version of activism,
which we can see here?
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on each situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need a person that addresses each
situation that arises.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can respect that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes all kinds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I first heard we were coming to
a legit cannabis church, I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff, where are you taking us?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I walked in and I was like,
oh, he's taking me home.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not my type of activism.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something that I would wake up on
Monday morning and say, today I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: found.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a feeling that the rev here
would be substantially less comfortable
[SPEAKER_01]: than I am going in front of city council
and lobbying for a specific zoning change
[SPEAKER_01]: or something of that nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, I have legal schooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually a law student.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on hiatus and stuff, and I'm more or
less the counsel for the church.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to deal with all our zoning and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this, you know exactly what I'm
talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Half the time when I bring it up,
people look at me like I'm talking
[SPEAKER_01]: gibberish or a language they've never
heard before.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I do consulting on the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll raise revenue for the church.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked at a law office for like four
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it saves me a lot of attorney fees for
the church.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I found you was your Facebook
posts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody was like, if you're following
cannabis activism, check out this guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I found you through your legal actions
and Facebook posts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to post a lot of great things that
would educate me, keep me on top of stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: and being a religious guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any time I get politically active,
I have to run on the Republican ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually did delegate all the way to the
state level this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a lot of them to flip their stance on
cannabis because they're scared they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have voters in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like third of unaffiliated third
Democrat.
[SPEAKER_00]: 30% Republican, 30, 30, and then 10% third
parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the only way to win is the flip done
affiliated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I told the Republicans,
the only way that's happening is to
[SPEAKER_00]: support our state rights for cannabis
because you're Republican, you stand for
[SPEAKER_00]: state rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's what we're seeing nationally
right now is a bunch of Republicans really
[SPEAKER_01]: standing up for cannabis specifically as a
state's rights issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never thought I'd find myself agreeing
with Cory Gardner on anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing, isn't it?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden I'm like, I'm kind of
a Cory Gardner fan and just saying that
[SPEAKER_01]: out loud might get me ostracized at
holidays, but like he's really standing up
[SPEAKER_01]: for Colorado on a state's rights issue and
really went to battle for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what we need.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have to keep open minded.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you said, I never thought I would be
agreeing with certain people either.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're out there changing people's
minds, granny.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're the one out there doing the mind
changing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's just because I'm me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Planting those little seeds of mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just like to talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it just, I don't know how I fell into
this, but I'm glad I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're so much easier to, you're not
intimidating.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have, you're nonthreatening.
[SPEAKER_03]: People can listen to this beautiful older
lady that's already got a life that has
[SPEAKER_03]: nothing to prove.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's got nothing to shoot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you're not trying to prove anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to have fun too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, but that, and that's the best part.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're having fun with cannabis while
advocating it and you've got a reason for
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not so grumpy, but dabbing grandpa
now, what are we calling him nowadays?
[SPEAKER_05]: They're calling him Kevin and he's having
a really good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Kevin is enjoying life because of
the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: This time they said, are you her security?
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said, no, I'm her husband.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out Kevin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you'd get to listen to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come next time, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can be on the show if you'd like.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're always invited.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll bring him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he can come.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun when we go hang out at events
because a lot of times things get,
[SPEAKER_03]: people like to come say hi to you and I,
sometimes I just look over at Kevin and he
[SPEAKER_03]: just looks at me like, yeah, this is my
life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I'll sneak away and go hang out
with him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody made me cry in my live the other
day.
[SPEAKER_05]: They said that indeed, see that I was
mobbed, that people were taking my picture
[SPEAKER_05]: and that he was standing to the side and
somebody said to him, when did you know
[SPEAKER_05]: Gail was a rock star?
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said, the day I married her.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_05]: That just was like, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew the moment I met you.
[SPEAKER_03]: He gave me a big old hug.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like we'd known each other forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd been talking on social media for so
long.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just like old friends that hadn't
seen each other in a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey Mike, what do you think these three
states that I've been to Michigan,
[SPEAKER_05]: California and DC, what do you think
they're in store for with legalization?
[SPEAKER_01]: A long fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they're all at different stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of them have quite obtained what
Colorado has yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are still having, I call it the wild
west.
[SPEAKER_05]: Michigan, I went to a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_05]: I walked in, the owner came out strapped,
smoking a blunt and said, come on around.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember those old school Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 2009 like a motherfucker right
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: 150 strains on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_05]: None of them grown in his dispensary.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not one, huh?
[SPEAKER_05]: Not one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just buy it and flip it as fast as I can.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado nowadays.
[SPEAKER_05]: 100 plus or minus.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100 milligrams plus or minus.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it says, plus or minus.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you might be getting 50.
[SPEAKER_05]: You might be getting 175.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every state's got to build their own lab
testing infrastructure and that takes a
[SPEAKER_01]: while.
[SPEAKER_01]: DC doesn't have an industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything I found in DC was products from
out of state.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't surprise me that there's a lot
of out of state products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of that shit that goes out of state
goes straight to the East coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't allow growing in DC,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can grow it, but you can't buy
it, but you can possess it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like Wyoming where you have
to go out of state to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you can't grow it, but you're
allowed to possess it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know the rules in each state,
but I think the places where you're not
[SPEAKER_03]: allowed to buy it at a store and you're
not allowed to cultivate, but you can have
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's completely silly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, because you can't sell it in DC.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's all trade and donate.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was, again, it was like a flea
market at the National Cannabis Festival
[SPEAKER_05]: on the mall.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to want their taxes really
soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because with legalization comes taxation
and regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the DC, I want to say it's city
council is legally prevented from spending
[SPEAKER_01]: money to draft the rules for the
legalization law that the voters pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it because of the federal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel free to slaughter me on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: State employees working on marijuana
stuff, kind of like how Wyoming was doing
[SPEAKER_00]: it with the CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: The political rules in DC are very odd.
[SPEAKER_01]: They live in a tiny portion of the country
that's not like the rest of the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so some of the rules and some of their
rights are a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're so close to like people from
Maryland came, people from all these
[SPEAKER_05]: places outlying.
[SPEAKER_05]: They all came to buy their medicine there.
It's.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's weird being from like I'm from
Colorado and so to me to travel to another
[SPEAKER_01]: state like that's something you need to
plan and pack a lunch for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've got to stop for gas a couple of
times before you get it done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are fully parts of the country
on the East Coast that Gail's looking to
[SPEAKER_01]: be like, I just said I could fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where these borders are tiny, it's like
driving 10 blocks away.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in another state.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but you should still have it
available in your state.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why it should be legal because
those invisible lines should make you.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you just change how you want it
legal in each state like alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there can be a Utah of pot where you
have to join the bar as a member to come
[SPEAKER_01]: in and pay your monthly dues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably be Utah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the church.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's how we run the church is
kind of how they run the bars and stuff in
[SPEAKER_00]: Utah.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: It works.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no riff raff here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a much higher code of standard as
far as patrons than any other church.
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard something today on the news that
just amazes me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is more government.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just released the first synthetic
CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do we need?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can make half of it is half of it is
like it's way easier to synthesize and
[SPEAKER_01]: grow to grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really need a Jeff and they don't want
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why the federal grow is so sad.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm worried that is what we have to
keep fighting or it will come to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's that's what legalization is coming
to.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, damn, we fought for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We fought for this.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's what we wanted.
[SPEAKER_05]: But look at the cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was one of my biggest frustrations in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the last season of weeds when
they take the big garden and it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: chopped up through a lab and put out in
peels.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are what's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my biggest disappointments in the
community in Colorado is we all took four
[SPEAKER_01]: years off after legalization passed to
celebrate and enjoy and build an industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I remember feeling like we won.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember laying off and saying then I
started seeing that they were going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: us through zoning and they were going to
turn it just back or back into exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: what we had before legalization and start
blocking us and fighting us out and
[SPEAKER_01]: rooting us out that way and getting a vote
for legalization, having that vote passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's just that's like maybe the
middle of the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you haven't reached the middle yet or
even come close to the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll fight as long and we all have to
gear up for it and keep it going.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been seeing where Californians want
to repeal 64.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that an option?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wouldn't get the support.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be crazy hard to do, but a lot of
the people in the black market or the gray
[SPEAKER_01]: market have a vested interest against
legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as legalization shows up,
the people that have been doing it for 25
[SPEAKER_01]: years in the mountains are out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless they can convert.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, how many people couldn't
convert here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody that so I feel like everybody
that could grow that had heart for a grow,
[SPEAKER_03]: they got pushed out and all the people
that had a bunch of money they took over.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now they're hiring people that have
heart to grow and not paying them worth a
[SPEAKER_03]: shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're kind of ruining the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is a product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Products are subpar because owners are
from corporations and they just want
[SPEAKER_03]: returns at margin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they don't care about quality
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they hire a guy like me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just being hypothetical.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can grow fucking his ass off and then
they don't give you the resources and they
[SPEAKER_03]: restrain you and restrict you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what this industry does.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've consulted for a couple of businesses
now for years that their problem is they
[SPEAKER_01]: will not invest in talent.
[SPEAKER_01]: They keep hiring their brother-in-law or
their cousin or a guy that came in and
[SPEAKER_01]: said he was a master grower and was down
for 13 an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talent is what produces high quality
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talent, skill, and support.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't have all three of those
going in your business, you can't produce
[SPEAKER_01]: a quality product.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I first came into this scene,
I really did believe it was patience over
[SPEAKER_05]: profit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really did believe that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought, oh yeah, we're doing a great
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is not that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is not that anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is profit over anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patience is not going to be a thing here
in Colorado in a few years.
[SPEAKER_03]: The patient model is disappearing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The soul got sucked out of this industry
when it became recreational legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Recreationally legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like that's when the soul got
ripped out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the first things kind of the state
and local governments did was raise the
[SPEAKER_01]: bar of entry into the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: First they said no felonies and then,
okay, no felonies for five years,
[SPEAKER_01]: no drug felonies for 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just with every whack they could
take, they made it harder and harder and
[SPEAKER_01]: harder for people in the industry before
legalization to participate in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry after.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the hurdle that really fixed it was
saying, all right, like in Aurora,
[SPEAKER_01]: you need $400,000 just in a duffel bag in
a safe in the back of your store to apply
[SPEAKER_01]: for a license.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to have 400 cash liquid on hand
in case you get sued or in case taxes come
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted you to have that on hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to, you know, that's just pocket
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pueblo tried to bring it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they added it to their list of
rules, their reasoning for doing so was,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, Aurora does it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I pointed out to city council
that we're not allowed to use banks,
[SPEAKER_01]: when we invest money in this industry,
it has to come from bank account in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado for money generated in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to withdraw that as cash and then
we can invest it in the business requiring
[SPEAKER_01]: us to have 400 grand or, and then they
lowered, well, maybe we'll only do 200
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, even 200 grand, you're
requiring me to put 200 grand in a duffel
[SPEAKER_01]: bag and just keep that in the bottom of
the gun safe in the back of my store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like think about what you're doing just a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super target.
[SPEAKER_01]: They immediately pulled that rag once they
realized what it meant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before I really like grab them by the
throat and drag them to reality,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of them thought it was a great idea
because, you know, if we want responsible
[SPEAKER_01]: business owners to be the only people
running these businesses, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: responsible business owners should have a
lot of money on hand, just cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just makes you sound like a drug
dealer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like a wildly irresponsible
business owner.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they did it because somebody else did
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because somebody else did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same reason we have five
nanograms is the limit for your,
[SPEAKER_01]: your blood draw in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five nanograms was what they had in some
other state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were like, well, Georgia does it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, well, they just picked a
fucking number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's no science behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think they'll ever come up?
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got to be able to come up with
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not even allowed to do the
research right now, Gail.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, that's how bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had this conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: They could pull me over and I'm always
going, I might not even have smoked your
[SPEAKER_05]: consume did all that day, but my blood is
going to say I'm high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went, I've been tested too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was way over five the next morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was 1130, 1400 or 14,000, whatever the
test was.
[SPEAKER_03]: They could test for 1400 or 14,000
nanograms per particle or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: This doctor called me back and he's like,
are you on a prescription for Marinol?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he goes, how did you do this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Your blood, your urine is as high as we
can test.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, I've been practicing for
that test.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, you passed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, didn't you know you were
getting a test?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, nope.
[SPEAKER_03]: That shit was a surprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: People like us, when they say it takes 30
days to clean your system out for a drug
[SPEAKER_01]: test for us, it takes months.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went 63 full days before I took a P test
and still failed that fucker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Josh said 72 days over there in the
corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: A flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: All passed one tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't taken one in 12 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I couldn't even guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to do my best not to get into a
situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what if they pulled you over?
[SPEAKER_01]: If they pulled me over right now,
I mean, I was, it's been a while since
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been pulled over, but I mean,
you hit them with the evening officer.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can I help you this evening?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they start looking for a business card
telling you have a good evening,
[SPEAKER_01]: usually before they even get to the
window.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like as long as my car doesn't reek,
I'm good to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I've been pulled over.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I've definitely been pulled over since
I had my badge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been at least four years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got pulled over and the cop could smell
the herb.
[SPEAKER_03]: I rolled down the window, got my license,
registration, proof of insurance in my
[SPEAKER_03]: hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the cop could smell the herb from 25
feet away from my car.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he just asked straight up,
sir, do you have marijuana in there?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like giggled like, yeah,
sir, I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a lot?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I go, no, I just got my personal and I
reached for my backpack and tap it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just got my personal bag in here and I
go, oh, it like dawns on me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I showed him, I got my badge on my
shoulder or on my chest here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, sorry, I work in a grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I run a really big commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just rubbing up against it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he goes, oh, my daughter's a trimmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he totally changed his whole tone.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, it smells pretty ripe in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, I'm going to give you a
warning because you were honest with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were going 92 in a 75.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's slow it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I see you got a new car.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're probably just seeing how fast it
goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's not go so fast today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he let it go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't you say that staying calm and
being articulate goes a long way?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take off your sunglasses, look them in the
eye, call them, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need to say a lot more.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're in a place where cannabis is
legal and they ask you if you have
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, don't fucking lie.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no reason to lie.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I said, yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's surreal the first time you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the first time I admitted,
yes, sir, I got weed in the car.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was, he kind of like smiled at me like,
I don't, he knew like, it was the first
[SPEAKER_03]: time you ever said yes to that question
because his shoulders went down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so did mine at the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, this is tense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have weed?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he goes, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, he's just, he's like patting me
on the head, basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you can have your weed, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And since I told him I had it,
he didn't go through my car.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't give me a fucking sobriety test.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't fuck my day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You weren't worried about your weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a quarter bag of a fucking rude boy
OG is what I think I had because I
[SPEAKER_03]: remember where I was going.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just stunk up the whole fucking
neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If he thought you were intoxicated,
he would have had you out on the car doing
[SPEAKER_01]: roadsides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clearly you didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was 11 in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_03]: No dad's at 11 on I-25.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget the smell we take home from the
grow until I'm changing my laundry from
[SPEAKER_01]: washer to dryer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I flipped that washer open and I go,
fuck, start it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Until you go to, go to the king supers or
something to get some ingredients for
[SPEAKER_03]: dinner on the way home and everyone in
there gives you a dirty look.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't be giving you dirty look.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was asked, we ordered dinner at a
restaurant in Springs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after we, it was a walk up and order
and then you go sit and wait and then you
[SPEAKER_03]: eat your food at the table there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You seat yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, after we ordered the guy said,
so we'll bring that outside to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're like, no, bro, it's like
snowing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to eat inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, no, not you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Reek of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: You must go outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: He wouldn't let you eat in the restaurant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at that point I turned around and asked
him for my money back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, if I can't eat in here,
I don't want the food, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm out.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a restaurant here in this town.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to say their name.
[SPEAKER_01]: The deal was a chair, a chair and a
sandwich.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you how I played Diva moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you just said that you made me get
all smiley.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to hear about your Diva moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: At that last festival, I wanted so badly
to go up on stage with the group that was
[SPEAKER_05]: playing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we want to say the name?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I know who they were.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Cypress Hill and Be Real.
[SPEAKER_05]: I so wanted to go up there and meet him.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've wanted to tell this story.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's required.
[SPEAKER_05]: So phone homie said, Gail, I asked,
they said no.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, oh, come on, we got all
access.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's try it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we go over and the security guy was so
sweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: He goes, granny, I can't, I can't let you
up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Chris crazy goes, where's tour
manager?
[SPEAKER_05]: Bring him over.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Chris, he goes, no, nobody can go up
on stage.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Chris crazy goes, just dab him granny.
[SPEAKER_05]: She damn near got a million fans.
[SPEAKER_05]: He let her go up on stage and he was like,
no, nobody's going up on stage.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I looked at them two and I was
like, well, we tried and we start walking
[SPEAKER_05]: away.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Chris goes, look, he's up there
talking to him now and we keep walking
[SPEAKER_05]: away.
[SPEAKER_05]: The tour manager come running back and
said, um, they said you can come and meet
[SPEAKER_05]: them after the set when they come off
stage.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, no, you wouldn't let me go up
on stage and have fun with the people.
[SPEAKER_05]: They sure as hell ain't getting a photo op
with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like your style, granny.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad you know to call that a diva
moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a big diva moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think anybody else in this room would
have a little stuck around for the photo
[SPEAKER_03]: op.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was stuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you see where I was coming from?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't want you the first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do they want you the second time?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to take this down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody find something good to ramble
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, what are you dabbing there?
[SPEAKER_03]: It is Charlie Sheen OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's supposed to be the HCFSE,
but it's real mushy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is monkey blood.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got turps in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's taking a hot dab as usual.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not red.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not ready.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I hope someday be real.
[SPEAKER_05]: I meet you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been enjoying one of his new
projects, but was never much a fan of the
[SPEAKER_01]: old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just said that on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's no hatred.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not your type of music.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just outside of my range.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just not your thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are allowed to like and dislike music.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's why there's so much of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: America.
[SPEAKER_03]: If anybody would like a dab at that
Charlie Sheen, I might recommend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was I'm roasted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to wait till a couple of other
people dab before I go again.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's sitting there on the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: Granny's got the huge flame going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Granny, can you teach us about insert
dabs?
[SPEAKER_03]: Granny's going to do an insert dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will describe this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This freaks me out earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to ask questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I talk about dabs a lot on the show and
I try to keep people updated on what's
[SPEAKER_03]: going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: The new way that we're dabbing to use a
banger.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks a lot like the old banger,
but it's bigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's much wider.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is use a small.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like a small rig, a small bubbler.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then this piece fits where your bowl would
go.
[SPEAKER_03]: It comes up at a 90 degree angle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it looks like it's got a giant glass
thimble on it, to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Granny's about to burn her arm with
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was damn near a dab brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's got a giant thimble.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there is a smaller thimble.
[SPEAKER_03]: You take the smaller glass thimble and you
load it with your dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Granny's putting a nice dab of this
Charlie Sheen OG in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a nice little insert.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you drop that one piece of glass
into the other piece of glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Drop it like it's hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you got one piece of glass that you
heat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you put your dab inside of another.
[SPEAKER_03]: You drop it in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you put a carb cap on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want that bubble cap, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you need a bubble cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a nice bubble rotation motion to
really spin those turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Move that air.
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as it starts bubbling,
Granny starts dabbing it and smoking it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you're going to say that sounds like a
lot of fucking work.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: At first, it's really turpy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is a little extra work,
but I like the ritual.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gives me one more step to participate
in my dab smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it'll slow me down one little step.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the things we have in
common.
[SPEAKER_01]: We both enjoy the ritual a lot more than
some of the other people I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's just part of us sitting there
and taking a dab and doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just feels nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that one more thing is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I don't like a knee nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no ritual.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can agree with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now the reason for the insert dab,
it's so much easier to pull that little
[SPEAKER_03]: insert out of there and drop that into the
cup of alcohol that she brought to clean
[SPEAKER_03]: it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then now it's fresh and clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: The scorched part of the dab didn't just
burn the inside of her nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: My nail is black and funky and tastes like
poop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Her dab tastes like turps and freshness
every time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they go on for a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did one the other night that was two
minutes and 27 seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a long dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a little jar of alcohol to go
with it though.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not required because she's got
multiple inserts and you could clean them
[SPEAKER_03]: off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Granny rolls in style.
[SPEAKER_03]: Granny is a spoiled hashbrat and I'm all
about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very spoiled.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thank the powers that be every day
that I live in this life.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not take it for granted.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're smoking the best hash on the planet
in a cannabis church in Colorado Springs
[SPEAKER_03]: with our best friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody's bugging us.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I could get a burger and a milkshake,
I'd never leave.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do that when we leave,
so don't worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would never leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: The chairs are comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people are good.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a good call, Granny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for putting this together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Insert dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, if you're trying to up your dab
level, I was wondering how you're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: get that out of there.
[SPEAKER_03]: She brings little tweezers with you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's got the whole kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not little tweezers.
[SPEAKER_01]: These look like they're the size of like a
a heavy duty letter opener.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's got a jar of ISO.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ISO, but it's starting to look like
cannabis moonshine at this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet it was clean when we started.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got an apple juice kind of color to
it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does kind of look like a pea sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was crystal clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked like water for a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was shine when I first saw
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I realized quickly that's a jar of
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_03]: Granny is going to keep her shit clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been an excellent podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a good fun time.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to grab that mic, brother,
you could definitely jump on that one
[SPEAKER_03]: since the ref got busy.
[SPEAKER_05]: How come you're so smiley, Josh?
[SPEAKER_05]: He's enjoyed the conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's watching the sausage get made.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are honored because we've got a winner.
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy is known as Irock Watts.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a winner of the Adam Dunn Show
Invitational one year.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's over there shaking his head no,
but this kid grows fire as cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: He knows what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you need some work done, this guy is
not afraid to put in fucking work.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's one of those guys that puts in hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: He gets up before the sun and he goes to
bed late at night.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's also an Instagram troll, so he's
always putting in hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got a donkey.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you had an alpaca.
[SPEAKER_01]: This show almost took a weird fucking
turn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Should we just title this one Donkey Show?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that the name of this episode?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to give the wrong impression.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't have an insane sexual reference
every time Granny is on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last episode was about boof and hash,
if I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did put a lot of suppositories.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you okay?
[SPEAKER_05]: I probably hurt myself somehow,
someway, and forgot how I did it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not kidding.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to get you a security guard and a
medic.
[SPEAKER_05]: After I did this fall that same night,
we were in that Airbnb and it was on the
[SPEAKER_05]: third floor.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have ever been to DC, those brown
stones are very high.
[SPEAKER_05]: The railing only came to my knee.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Kevin said order Grubhub,
so I ordered us dinner, but he had to go
[SPEAKER_05]: to the gate to meet him.
[SPEAKER_05]: He texted me, I'm here, and I said,
I'll go get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kevin said, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: If anybody could fall off this thing and
hurt themselves, it's you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nighttime.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go get the food.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kevin, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Noses lady.
[SPEAKER_01]: Noses lady.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a couple that should stay together.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's some shit my wife would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: We take care of one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want the Chinese food to make it into
the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay the fuck on the couch.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want the French fries to survive the
drive.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fries never make it home.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been together 45 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, he should be on the show next time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to hear some of those stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to hear about some of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, he told one.
[SPEAKER_05]: He told about me dancing on tables.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kevin doesn't tell a lot of stories,
but he told one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I didn't write down the word twerk
because I was trying to dodge it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But would you like to tell us about your
twerk adventure, Miss Granny?
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't ever give me Hennessy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like stories that start with a stern
look.
[SPEAKER_01]: The key to the lock is Hennessy.
[SPEAKER_03]: A stern look.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's never given me a look that serious
before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't ever give me Hennessy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Phone homie said, will you do your party
trick on my, it's called the Slab Hour on
[SPEAKER_05]: WLSV radio.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know he was giving me Hennessy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got drunk on the Slab Hour and they
had a rapper up there and I jumped up on
[SPEAKER_05]: stage and I didn't know it, but I seen the
video.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm twerking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see that video.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to find that video.
[SPEAKER_03]: Project for tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Were you doing the Granny's party trick?
[SPEAKER_03]: I did the party trick.
[SPEAKER_03]: The traditional.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to describe the party trick,
but I don't know if I get the steps in the
[SPEAKER_03]: correct order.
[SPEAKER_03]: Will you teach us about?
[SPEAKER_03]: I will.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they didn't have a bong, so I had to
take a hit out of a spoon bowl.
[SPEAKER_05]: But normally it would be a bong.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be a bong.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd do a bong rip.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I threw back that shot of
Hennessy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what would your normal shot be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wall holding, she's still holding the pipe
rip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a, take a rip, hold it in,
then do the shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I take the shot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually it'll be like one of them fruity,
like they're kind of like wine cooler
[SPEAKER_05]: shots is what I equivitate them to.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't even talk, but they're fruity
shots.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not shooting 151.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're called porn stars.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's, it's like a raspberry vodka.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not very strong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you just get in a strain?
[SPEAKER_05]: So then I take the shot, then I do a dab
and then I chug a beer, a pint of beer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I exhale.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I did that on Rico's show, but then I
went back and did another dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I just drank out of the Hennessy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's worth thinking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: That part is what did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is what did it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So can you tell me part of the story that
you told earlier about what happened in
[SPEAKER_03]: that damn studio?
[SPEAKER_03]: About my friend losing control.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, please.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a very, you know, it's a cannabis
radio show and Chris Crazy and I,
[SPEAKER_05]: we just lost control.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were, we were, we were just out of
control doing crazy stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: You didn't have a white mic with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, my husband was out in the audience
watching me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank God he loves me.
[SPEAKER_05]: The poor guy that's phone homey is the
host of the radio show stands up and says,
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my God, I just lost control.
[SPEAKER_05]: I lost control.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he poured a beer over his head.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Chris Crazy says, Oh my God,
that's a first.
[SPEAKER_05]: He has never lost it like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just made him lose control of his own
joke.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they asked me, was that going to happen
tonight?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's not that kind of show.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no hand in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not one for losing control.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did eat edibles and try to fly away on
one episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was different.
[SPEAKER_03]: I needed a damn seatbelt.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure that wasn't, they said 350
milligrams in that peanut butter bar.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was more than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was more than 350 minus or plus 125
knows that mountain medicine peanut butter
[SPEAKER_03]: bar.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was labeled at 350.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as soon as I bit into it, I was like,
that tastes just like pure weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like biting into a brick of Mexican
brick weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I ate it about 20 minutes later.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, yeah, that was way more than
350 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I was fine or melting to
hit me like 20 or 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can hear it in the podcast because I'm
talking, I'm talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they're so overmedicated,
like that half the time when you bite into
[SPEAKER_01]: it, you get distillate like on your gums
and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was before distillate.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was before those days.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was when everything was can of butter
and it just tasted like it squirted can of
[SPEAKER_03]: butter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You speed up that absorption rate with all
that oil in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just so scrawny anyway that I
just, the edibles hit me right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like 20 minutes later, I was just wrecked.
[SPEAKER_03]: That thing had to be 500 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_03]: It may be six.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It fucked me up so quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking at you cause it takes about a
thousand milligrams for me to even feel
[SPEAKER_05]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to say what I take
regularly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when I feel it about a half hour
later, I'm passed out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Josh said, how much is too much for you?
[SPEAKER_03]: 500 is too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your normal dose if you're going to
eat edibles?
[SPEAKER_03]: He said a hundred and he gave me the,
that thing you do with your hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like no fucking more.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm out.
[SPEAKER_03]: He gave me that hand motion.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to give Josh a mic and let him
talk for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're pushing it, how often do you eat
edibles though?
[SPEAKER_02]: Every other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you still haven't built up a
tolerance.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I just know what's too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ride that line.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reason to build it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay a cheap date.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay a cheap date.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe one weekend.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to try like three or 500 for
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: One weekend.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to throw down a three or 500
and just see what you can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ate a 500 the other night and then I
remember having a dream about I bought a
[SPEAKER_02]: Ferrari.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you a Ferrari guy?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even think I've ever seen one up
close.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you totally bought one in the dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you just bobbing it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just going brrrr, just tearing it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was red.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe deep inside, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to grow a mullet and get a
Ferrari.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that you've just been dreaming
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want more like a Camaro limo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've seen your collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Camaro limo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to jump it if you put it up
on some ramps?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jump over the alpaca?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, or maybe we could just jump the
alpaca over the limo, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: This got weird pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get TJ on the donkey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's TJ?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I know TJ?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to want to explain that
sentence a little more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Extension cord guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because we let TJ ride the donkey.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you guys sipping over there?
[SPEAKER_02]: I see you double cupping it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took one sip off that and I already knew
that was too much for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Granny's cannelline.
[SPEAKER_03]: 500 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_03]: Funk juice.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an N in there, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Funk.
[SPEAKER_03]: F-U-N-K.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gonna funk you up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where did that come from?
[SPEAKER_05]: DC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's imported.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's a little bit of local stuff
here in front of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you find that the drinks hit you more
quickly?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm high all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're kind of saturated.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wake up for about an hour and then I
start dabbing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I won't dab until the first
break.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'll wait till the first break.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good to go in and get shit figured
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: See what's going on for the day and then
get it all set.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm past that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm retired.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to make a list of what to do and get
my rhythm on and then take a couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: dabs so that I know I'm not fucking up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to make it through that morning
traffic still.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want your wits about you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I run a large commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's always this game of the first
thing you do in the morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck broke last night.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first thing you do is go find out what
fucked up last night.
[SPEAKER_05]: How big is a large commercial grow?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one room has 55 lights and we have
seven rooms total.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seven flower rooms, two bedrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a big grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of stuff going on and it's
not understaffed, but it's barely staffed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Precision staffing is how we like to think
of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we could use you, but we don't want
to pay you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're just going to keep going like we
are.
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as I've known you, you've never
lost your passion for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always something new to spark it
in me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It started to kind of I got overwhelmed
with these grows and then they gave me a
[SPEAKER_03]: brand new one.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, look at all these new lights
you get and all these new tapes.
[SPEAKER_03]: All these tables and this new irrigation
and they brought me new strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: Work is work, but you still have a
passion.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know who the hell would I be
without cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: What would I, I would be a musician and it
wouldn't be a happy life because I'd be on
[SPEAKER_03]: the road.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be on the road addicted to drugs and
that's not a future for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the way to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you be a politician without
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably would be a psychologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I graduated college, I was going to
go put broken teenagers back together.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good mission.
[SPEAKER_03]: Teenagers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Teenagers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So right is there truly broken and then
you get to try to mess with them?
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned the hard way that that's way too
late to intervene.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a 15 year old girl and I was
going to say that they're not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: change anything about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that, when I went and worked with
the much younger kids, the five,
[SPEAKER_01]: six, seven year olds in social service
care, they like broke my psyche.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's why I was fucked up when we
met was because I was still coming off
[SPEAKER_01]: that job and hadn't recovered yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't think I could deal with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's every day they'd be like,
here, there's a new kid coming in and then
[SPEAKER_01]: they would hand you a notebook with the
world's most horrible story in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that happened like twice a week for
three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like emotionally, that's more than
one person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even think about it in serious
terms and I don't like to dwell on that
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your eyes look like you're distant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not even.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a whole different book that came
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling a trauma story right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of job could cause PTSD,
couldn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure it can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no nightmares for months and months
after.
[SPEAKER_01]: I left that industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: My aunt was a social worker in Cedar
Rapids, Iowa, and she loved it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was her passion.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was like, that's too emotional for
me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't deal with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only positive part was working with
the older kids was I had a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: an ability to yank the occasional kid out
of the meat grinder before the system
[SPEAKER_01]: fully chewed him to death.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once I went to work with the younger
kids, just like that level of fucked up in
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just it takes a certain type of
person to psychologically cope with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can that even exist?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you have to roll with it and then
you've got to do like therapy sessions
[SPEAKER_01]: with the family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just seriously, I didn't have the
time to become invested.
Nope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were way too young for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got your own family.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they needed people because it's so
underfunded.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't afford people who actually know
what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or care.
[SPEAKER_01]: So me right out of college, they were
like, here's a bunch of gang kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: White Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care of all these gang kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you guys feel that and I'm just asking
because I am definitely doing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you guys feel like you go through
phases where sometimes you can smoke all
[SPEAKER_03]: the hash and you don't get properly
medicated or high enough or where you want
[SPEAKER_03]: to be?
[SPEAKER_03]: But then like four or five days later,
you'll open up your jar and you'll try to
[SPEAKER_03]: take a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as soon as you hit it, you're like,
I am so high.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it'll last for maybe an hour.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going through one of those phases
where just little tiny dabs have just been
[SPEAKER_03]: wrecking me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not complaining.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wondered if other people experience
it and it sounds like you do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you taken a tolerance break or
anything?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't do that, Gail.
[SPEAKER_05]: Me either.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I had a natural path doctor.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were talking about things like I have
stomach problems and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're just talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're a friend of mine and they actually
ran the holistic clinic in the town I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: from.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's passed now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're talking and she's like,
so what are you doing for that stomach
[SPEAKER_03]: pain and stuff?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, I just smoke like this
much hash and I do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's like, you better not ever stop
smoking because if you do whatever is
[SPEAKER_03]: really wrong with you, it's going to show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that to be true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, so yeah, I'm just going to keep
consuming the way I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is what's keeping him alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been true for like 25 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wouldn't go that far with myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: The doctors that he's working with
convinced him to get off cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: completely, just like give it 30 days,
old man, see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on day 15, they were like,
please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please, for the love of God, go smoke a
joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're going to die.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff, do you take CBD on the reg too?
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not take CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like the way CBD makes me feel.
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD got me through my head injury at
certain times.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I feel like once I got past a
certain point with the head injury,
[SPEAKER_03]: the CBD wasn't doing what I wanted it to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Were you only smoking it or were you using
it in a tincture?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was taking pills and I was smoking dabs
of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I had when I first hit my head,
it felt like I had so you guys just a
[SPEAKER_03]: reminder or update or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a traumatic brain injury in April of
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smash is headed to the top of a set of
stairs in a doorway, a low doorway.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got the low doorway, knocked myself
clean at the top of some stairs,
[SPEAKER_03]: knocked myself out, fell down the stairs,
woke up at the bottom of the stairs.
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple of friends were pulling me up the
stairs, had a traumatic brain injury,
[SPEAKER_03]: a subdural hematoma and untreated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike had a few problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, my head hurt fucking bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was at Maddie and Spence's house and
Spence was making CBD concentrates for a
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, dog, you need that CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I took a couple of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the stuff that ended up winning the
cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I took a couple of big dabs of that and
each dab felt it felt like I had a belt
[SPEAKER_03]: too tight around my head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you put a belt around my head and
stomped on it and tried to get a ratchet
[SPEAKER_03]: clamp.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I took that CBD dab, it felt like
you just took it off half a notch.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody in the room could see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a huge difference in me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maddie was like, are you feeling better?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, dude, I'm coming back
because when I hit my head, I knocked the
[SPEAKER_03]: shit out of myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't do math.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I'm not even kidding.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't do math.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably couldn't remember simple words
like the and.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could.
[SPEAKER_03]: But instead I would say pickle or like,
yeah, yeah, I had really weird symptoms.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had other physical symptoms.
[SPEAKER_03]: I talk about my nervous boner.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would get a raging erection for no
reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I got nervous or anxious, just get a
huge boner, which would just make me more.
[SPEAKER_03]: How uncomfortable is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm an adult.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't have a boner in public.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking horrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so I smoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then Spence was like, Doug, you need more
of the CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can see a difference in you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was smoking the CBD with Spence and
he gave me a little bit of it and it got
[SPEAKER_03]: me through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I got past the dark times,
I call it, of my head injury.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were terrible things going through
my mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know that I was going to make it
through that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I didn't have friends like Mike and a
few other people that were around my mom,
[SPEAKER_03]: probably granny, a few other people that
took good care of me and they knew I had a
[SPEAKER_03]: brain injury that would if I started
saying weird shit, they'd just come hang
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd be like, it's like three in the
morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are you still here?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, it's cool, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to hang out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd be like, oh, I'm talking strange
or something's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could tell that that's why they're here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I wasn't cognizant to figure out
exactly why.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I knew, I was like subconsciously,
I was like, you're just keeping an eye on
[SPEAKER_03]: me.
[SPEAKER_03]: You think I might hurt myself or might try
to microwave the batteries or something?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I was doing weird and saying weird
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So eventually the CBD got me through the
dark times and I realized that the high
[SPEAKER_03]: THC was what I needed now because the pain
was gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: The thoughts scrambling and the word
disassociation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys, I clearly was asking my mom
to pass me a banana to put in a smoothie.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I kept calling it a fucking burrito
and was getting angry at my mom for not
[SPEAKER_03]: giving me the burrito.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because she didn't understand what you
were.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me the goddamn burrito.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's like, there's not a burrito over
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, I'm fucking pointing at a
burrito, mom.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want that burrito.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are you fucking with me?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was making me really mad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, why would my mom do this to me?
[SPEAKER_03]: I want that burrito.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to touch it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to eat it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I meant banana.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was really having my back.
[SPEAKER_03]: So things were weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was coming back.
[SPEAKER_03]: All my signals were going to the right
path.
[SPEAKER_03]: But my thoughts would, I don't know,
they would scatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would feel like I got a filing cabinet
in my brain and somebody just dumped out
[SPEAKER_03]: the files and they were still there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just couldn't get to them as quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be like, oh, you want to know my name?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd have to shuffle through all the
papers and then we'd find it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, here's my birthday.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could tell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I started smoking the high THC stuff
and I started putting it back together.
[SPEAKER_03]: The puzzle pieces.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I start getting that like,
I can't remember shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: The high THC, the limonene and THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you still get that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know because I stay so well
medicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know, I had brain farts before
I hit my head.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to think too many things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm responsible for 15 employees,
two grows, a daughter, friends,
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, podcast,
driving, putting on my shoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got so many things.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be a fucking brain fart
in there somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I can tell the difference between
the brain injury brain farts and the
[SPEAKER_03]: natural, you're just thinking too many
things or you had too many dabs brain
[SPEAKER_03]: farts.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now what does the CBD do?
[SPEAKER_05]: What does it make you feel like?
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes me gumby like.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes me not feel like I've got
complete control of my fingers and my
[SPEAKER_03]: hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if I go to try to, you ever been in
the cold and your thumbs are too cold and
[SPEAKER_03]: you can't text?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what CBD does to my thumbs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I feel like I'm missing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of hitting the O, I'm hitting the
P. That's strange.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just makes my, my dexterity goes funky.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, and so I don't smoke it.
[SPEAKER_03]: When people like, this is mad CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, Oh, give that to granny who it
works for or Mike who it works for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's a waste on me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just doesn't do what I want it to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're on tinctures and it ruins my THC
high.
[SPEAKER_03]: It, if I get, it takes me because it takes
me a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm medicating.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first three dabs are medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fourth and fifth one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably recreational, but it takes
me a minute to get where I need to be
[SPEAKER_03]: medicinally.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to smoke to get my, to build it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, if you take a whatever,
250 milligram pill, I got to get my 250
[SPEAKER_03]: milligrams or whatever in my body by
consuming it before I start noticing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just go in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the beautiful part of inhalation is
it's almost instant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't want to fuck that up with CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to just, I, I run into that
all the time because I eat a lot of,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, not a lot for the people at this
table, but a lot for civilians,
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I've been hurting all day and we've
been running around really hard and like
[SPEAKER_01]: my knees, my head, my back are all killing
on harvest day.
[SPEAKER_03]: We harvest 165 plants in one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: On days like that, I'll end up consuming
four or five times the normal amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of CBD THC pills that I normally take.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on those days when I go home and I'm
like, all right, end of the day,
[SPEAKER_01]: kids asleep, want to relax, want to get a
nice buzz going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take four or five bong hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, sober as a judge.
Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it a couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it a couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll cough for a couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike likes to cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll start to get to where I want
to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on days where I haven't been hurting
and it's been office work all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I didn't even take a pill that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get home for that first bong rep puts me
halfway to where I want to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so much quicker.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think we really need CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: I take tincture every morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't smoke it anymore, but I feel like
it's, uh, what's the drug they give you
[SPEAKER_03]: when you're, it's like Norcan to your
heroin.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the, it's the same thing for my
THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD rescue pills for people who weigh over
consumed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and I don't want that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I spend so much time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Time and money trying to consume all this
THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But don't you believe like, if you take a
tincture in the morning, that's not like
[SPEAKER_05]: smoking it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Smoking it is going to do something
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should try.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't feel like I go the other way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'll give you a success story.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to hear it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kevin's been taken off the transplant list
and fixed himself with CBD with CBD and
[SPEAKER_05]: THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you mind telling more, a little backup
story about what he was going to have
[SPEAKER_03]: transplanted and what do you have cured
with it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't, don't go too far that you're not
comfortable.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't ask for too much details.
[SPEAKER_05]: In 93 he was diagnosed with hepatitis C,
went through several different treatments
[SPEAKER_05]: to try to rid him of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every treatment gave him worse symptoms.
[SPEAKER_05]: He never got rid of the hepatitis C,
um, put him into cirrhosis of the liver.
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally in 2011, they put him on a new
experimental drug.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's what you see on TV now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Harvoni.
[SPEAKER_05]: It rid him of the hepatitis C,
but there was so much damage done to his
[SPEAKER_05]: liver that he had been listed for a
transplant for a liver.
[SPEAKER_05]: But he was also on so many other drugs
because of all the other symptoms that
[SPEAKER_05]: come along with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how he became that opioid zombie.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once we got him off all the opioids and he
started coming around like a normal human
[SPEAKER_05]: being again, started taking the CBD
tincture with me every day, um,
[SPEAKER_05]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_05]: He doesn't dab, but he will smoke flour.
[SPEAKER_05]: His checkup in January, his liver
functions are all coming back to the point
[SPEAKER_05]: that the head doctor came in and went,
wait a minute, wait a minute, left the
[SPEAKER_05]: room, came back with Kevin's whole team
and said, look at Kevin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at how good he is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Said, I know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You look so good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your functions are so well.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you feel about us removing you from
the transplant list?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of it was like, are you kidding?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was taking a dab, but that is amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations to you and Kevin,
cause that's the greatest news.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's easier for both of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at us.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're out there having fun.

[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, yeah, he's still got issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's, he's got diabetes, so he gets shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: He gets tired in his feet.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got neuropathy and he gets tired
cause he still got liver issues,

[SPEAKER_03]: I thought he was dying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you get to keep him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He gets to keep you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you guys have a lot of more years
together.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you guys feel like cannabis is messing
with your dreams?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you dream when you smoke?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have, so people talk about, they smoke
indica to go to sleep and sativas during
[SPEAKER_03]: the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do the opposite kind of, I like to smoke
a heavy sativa right before bed and get
[SPEAKER_03]: lit like, like fucking tour.
[SPEAKER_03]: How can you sleep?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I just lay down and giggle and giggle
until I fall asleep and I have the best
[SPEAKER_03]: dreams.
[SPEAKER_03]: I fly away.
[SPEAKER_03]: I go to all the greatest places.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do all the great shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll take a big dab of that pre 98 and it
will knock me out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I need like, well, like on Friday
night, like tonight it's Friday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I don't, I can sleep in a little bit
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have to get up when the alarm goes
off.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll just get, and I'm tired cause I
work, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: I, that's how I sleep.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm tired.
[SPEAKER_03]: My body, I put in the hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we carry a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: We grow a bunch of weed harvesting now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but so I'll smoke that a super heavy
sativa right before I go to bed and I'll
[SPEAKER_03]: have the best dreams.
[SPEAKER_03]: I dream like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have all the dreams that you think you
can dream about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like flying dreams, fucking Ferrari
dreams, weird sex dreams, swimming in the
[SPEAKER_03]: sky dreams, living in a tree dreams.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't dream that much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I have the craziest dreams.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried your big sativa dab at bed trick
and I just stayed up all night.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fucking laundry did not work at all
for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how I would be.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just got to get, so do you dream Mike?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not when I consume.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the things I really like about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what a lot of people say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had fucked up dreams before I started
consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd lose the dream either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the weirdest dreams when I was
forced like two years sober in Wyoming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I lose the dreams turned to like not
cool, fun dreams, but to like all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: weird like getting busted.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys haven't eaten meat and I can say
realistically, I know 2001 I went on fish
[SPEAKER_03]: tour with my friend Rob and I was a pain
in the ass because I wasn't eating meat.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was a lot of subway and a lot of
Taco Bell on that tour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Rob for putting up with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's been since at least 2001 since
I've consumed meat and I had dreams the
[SPEAKER_03]: other night that I was eating.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was at a restaurant where I grew up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Angelo's burgers.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Belfour, California, they used to have
the most delicious fucking steak
[SPEAKER_03]: sandwiches ever, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was sitting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was getting hungry right now talking
about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was eating a steak sandwich and
everybody at the table gave me that look
[SPEAKER_03]: like if I were to just pull out crack
right now and smoke it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone gave me that same look like,
hey, you're you're eating a steak
[SPEAKER_03]: sandwich, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my answer was fucking delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just kept chewing it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everyone at the table was like,
dude, you're a strict vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, oh, it doesn't look like
it now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just eat that motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I woke up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: And did you do this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you didn't have no grease
around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look around.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did wake up one night.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took some medicine and I woke up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took some mucinex and I woke up with a
fucking peanut butter and jelly sandwich
[SPEAKER_03]: in my bed that I do not remember making.
[SPEAKER_03]: Full on made that shit in my sleep on the
mucinex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good old Farmees.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to OD on the Farmees and see what
happens in your life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Too many liquids and take a fat dab and
wake up with a peanut butter and jelly
[SPEAKER_03]: sandwich next to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing weird happened, I hope.
[SPEAKER_03]: But where the fuck was I?
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody put me back on track.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we got to wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost closing time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trying to get out of here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Church is almost over, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a perfect close.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a perfect way to end a rusted Jeff

it on episode two.

[SPEAKER_03]: We took some green thumb rosin dabs,
which you guys changed my opinion of
[SPEAKER_03]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tasted amazing, but I coughed for more
than normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you even said that it lingered.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's heavy on the lungs.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is kind of heavy.
