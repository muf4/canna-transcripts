[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, what a podcast world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your boy Rasta Jeff coming to you
with episode number 106 of the grow from
[SPEAKER_01]: your heart podcast, your source for
cannabis news, education and conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I'm coming to you with another
show from the car.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have been traveling back and
forth between Colorado Springs and Pueblo
[SPEAKER_01]: quite a bit lately, and it's an hour drive
each direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have had a lot of time to think and I
have definitely had some time to do some
[SPEAKER_01]: recording.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here I am on the microphone traveling
on the interstate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is Wednesday, November 18th.
[SPEAKER_01]: I plan on putting this episode out on
Thursday, the 19th.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just going to be a bonus
episode and I hope you guys enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make a very special announcement
while I'm here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, as of yesterday around noon,
I am no longer involved with the spot
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have severed all ties with the spot
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not employed by them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not affiliated with them and I am not
advertising for the spot in any way any
[SPEAKER_01]: longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to say goodbye to the spot
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't work there anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fun, but I've got to do other
things with myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no hard feelings or ill will or any
hatred or anything toward the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just need to move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes there are other options in life
that you need to follow or need to pursue,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's what I'm going to do with
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that being said, let me make one more
huge announcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: As of today around noon, I am officially
the lead cultivator at Green and Healthy
[SPEAKER_01]: Wellness in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I quit a job yesterday and I've got a new
job today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out to Hunt and the Grammy
Gatsby and the Green and Healthy Wellness
[SPEAKER_01]: crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few weeks ago, it was about two weeks
ago when the owner of Green and Healthy
[SPEAKER_01]: Wellness gave me a call and he said,
hey bro, do you know anybody that would be
[SPEAKER_01]: qualified to run a large grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, yeah, what do you need?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he gave me a nice description of the
job and he told me what would be required.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, you know, I think I want that
job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, no way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, no, for real, I want the
job because I'm not happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not happy with what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we talked about it for a couple of
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I drove up and checked out the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent a lot of time in the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent a lot of time with the crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is a go, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where I need to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to be working at Green and Healthy
Wellness with Hunt, with Damsel,
[SPEAKER_01]: with Randall's.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's part of the team.
[SPEAKER_01]: So team Dreadlocks is getting a little bit
stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Green and Healthy Wellness
for having faith in me and giving me the
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity to be the lead grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I'm going to be the one
producing all of the medicine for their
[SPEAKER_01]: medical marijuana shop in Colorado
Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're a medical patient,
look forward to... We should have a
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest coming down mid-February-ish,
is what I have planned in my vision.
[SPEAKER_01]: So around March, around March 1st to St.
Patrick's Day-ish, we should have some
[SPEAKER_01]: Rasta Jeff grown flowers available for the
medical patients at Green and Healthy
[SPEAKER_01]: Wellness in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I want to kind of elaborate here,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to let you know why I quit the spot
and let you know what's going on,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I don't want you to think that I
hate the spot or that anything shitty
[SPEAKER_01]: happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been at the spot since the middle of
July, and we have been building and
[SPEAKER_01]: getting things finalized, and there is no
sign of having plants in that building for
[SPEAKER_01]: at least another month or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am not... I'm not a plumber.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a construction worker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do basic things, but I've been
trying to find stuff to keep me busy for
[SPEAKER_01]: 40 hours a week in the spot for the past
month, and there's nothing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And without plants in there, I've been
going crazy, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: The building is not ready for plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not ready to cultivate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was expected to be there and perform,
so it was hard to be there every day with
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was making me super anxious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was making me bored.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was spending way too much time on social
media because I was bored at the shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when my buddy Hunt called and said,
hey, we need help here at Green and
[SPEAKER_01]: Healthy, it felt like the right thing to
do, to jump on and be part of the team.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the spot, they run hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big, huge hydro setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not a hydro grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a soil farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the Green and Healthy Grow,
we're running three gallon pots of
[SPEAKER_01]: soilless mix with plants already in the
building.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are plants there waiting for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Friday, I'm going to move plants to the
flowering room, and I'm going to give them
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit of time to veg in the flower
room in their new home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And about 10 to 14 days after that,
I plan to flower the first crop for Green
[SPEAKER_01]: and Healthy Welling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm leaving a facility that will not
have plants until my first harvest at my
[SPEAKER_01]: new facility is finished, is what it feels
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm in it to grow, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to grow and produce quality
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to make a move.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to make a huge move.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an hour drive to and from work
every single day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a soil garden with my homies,
The Grimy Gatsby and Dude It's Damsel and
[SPEAKER_01]: John Randall's Jr. So in my mind,
this is the right decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you got to just, you got to make
a move that scares you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to make a move that puts you on
the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to make a move that breaks you out
of your routine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like my life has really been
routine for the past couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And shaking myself up like this really
puts, it lights a new fire under my ass,
[SPEAKER_01]: so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: It puts fresh ideas in my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find a new inspiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: I meet new people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go new places.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really improves my life overall when I
put myself in a uncomfortable position.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I break out of my comfort bubble and
put myself in a position where I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly sure how this is going to play
out, it always works very well for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you guys are scared to do something,
if there's something you're thinking about
[SPEAKER_01]: doing, if there's a big change in your
life that you're thinking about making,
[SPEAKER_01]: all I can say is grab your balls and do
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Success is scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you succeed and you see what it's
like to succeed and not fall down from
[SPEAKER_01]: that, all you're going to do is want to
succeed more and more and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your goals are going to get bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your dreams are going to get bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your abilities to reach those dreams will
get bigger right alongside all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're afraid of something,
don't be scared, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can fucking do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's going to happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to try and you're either
going to succeed or you're going to fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you fail, you're going to be right
where you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to go backwards by
failing because trying something is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to give you skills.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to at least be trying
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to feel better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you succeed, holy shit,
you just succeeded at something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just opened a new door to your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have a new thing you can do or
somewhere else you can go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what is that going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be a building block for
the next places you can go and the next
[SPEAKER_01]: things you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're scared, if you're stuck in
your comfort zone, if you're stuck in your
[SPEAKER_01]: little bubble, you guys, all I can say is
step out of that and try to do some new
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have some faith in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have some faith in yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have some faith in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you're not a spiritual or a
religious person, you can have some
[SPEAKER_01]: confidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have some, I guess, faith is what
you need to have and don't have fear of
[SPEAKER_01]: failing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your life is good right now and you try
something and you fail, you're still going
[SPEAKER_01]: to have the life you've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's going to take it away from you
because you messed up trying something
[SPEAKER_01]: new.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anybody that does talk shit to you and
disrespects you because you tried
[SPEAKER_01]: something new and you failed, they are not
your friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your friends are going to support you
through your failures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your friends are going to say,
man, that looked like a challenging task
[SPEAKER_01]: to try to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm proud of you just for getting off
your ass and trying it because 75% of the
[SPEAKER_01]: people that are out there wouldn't even
have gotten off their asses to attempt
[SPEAKER_01]: what you just failed at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't be afraid to fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to try some shit, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that's my inspirational talk for
the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my announcement for the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am driving down I-25 on a beautiful damn
Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is so gorgeous out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a cloud in the sky.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see for a hundred miles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see Pike's Peak.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see the wet mountains.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is such a gorgeous day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So guys, get outside, suck up some
sunshine.
[SPEAKER_01]: The winter is coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should talk about how to prepare your
grow for the winter, I guess, pretty soon
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's some good shit to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I'm getting out of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm rambling into this
microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope everybody has a wonderful day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke some great cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke some good hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid to reach your goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And until next time, you guys,
take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: you next time.
