[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's jump into today's main
topic of this podcast today's question
[SPEAKER_00]: came from the grow help tab on the I read
genetics website if you go to my website I
[SPEAKER_00]: read genetics calm there is a row of tabs
on the top one of them does say grow help
[SPEAKER_00]: or grow questions Click on that tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me your grow question If I read your
grow question here on the podcast you will
[SPEAKER_00]: win a free pack of I read genetics premium
seeds So if you've got a great question,
[SPEAKER_00]: please send it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a good chance I will read a good
question here on the show if I have not
[SPEAKER_00]: read your question Please do not feel
discouraged.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a mountain of emails here in
front of me We are slowly working our way
[SPEAKER_00]: through them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may get to your question In the next
episode it may be a couple of shows don't
[SPEAKER_00]: feel discouraged Also, please do keep
sending those questions even though I've
[SPEAKER_00]: got a bunch There are a lot of great
questions that keep coming in Alright,
[SPEAKER_00]: let me stay focused the person that sent
me this question did not send me a name
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do send me a real name and a
shipping address and I will happily send
[SPEAKER_00]: you a free pack of I read genetics premium
seeds You never know what you may get it
[SPEAKER_00]: may be something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be something old.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be regular It could be feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be unreleased.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be something that's been sold out
on the website That I discovered I had a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of hidden somewhere You never know
what you may get as a prize for sending a
[SPEAKER_00]: question to the grow help tab Anyway,
send me your address because I do owe you
[SPEAKER_00]: a pack of seeds if you sent this message
This one goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says hey Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a pack of fist bump Good choice,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fist bump is a great cross It says it came
with a free five pack of tangy ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is also a great cross The tangy
ripper is of course platinum tangy the
[SPEAKER_00]: platinum tangy female cross to a Jack the
Ripper male it makes a super orange candy
[SPEAKER_00]: flavored buds a big pine cone big donkey
dick buds That have some orange flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: with like a lemon lime background sort of
that turpentine dryer sheet hint to it
[SPEAKER_00]: really Really zesty flavored bud really
nice head buzz real social weed real easy
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow flowers in my opinion Let me stay
focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says these plants are in week six and
it seems as if they may finish Super late.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so you're in week six and it's
looking like they may Finish super late.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of those plants do go about nine,
maybe ten weeks, maybe 72 days So you got
[SPEAKER_00]: a ways to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what you consider super late
Some of my stuff some of the plants I grow
[SPEAKER_00]: for myself go 14 weeks So I'm not sure
what some people consider super late,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may take you 72 days Now here's where
it gets interesting and fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's where our question arises It says
since you were the creator of this
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar, when do you think I should start
flushing these plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to flush Too early,
please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me some tips so I can be successful
now This is the part of the podcast where
[SPEAKER_00]: things are going to get very interesting a
long time ago I did a full episode about
[SPEAKER_00]: flushing our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I preach that we should let me talk about
what I mean by flushing Let's start there
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm referring to at this point in
this episode throughout this episode when
[SPEAKER_00]: I say flushing right now I am talking
about usually 10 to 14 days before harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: I would preach to water our plants with
just Water with no nutrients in an attempt
[SPEAKER_00]: to clean out whatever the plants are in if
it's cocoa if it's soil Soilless mix let's
[SPEAKER_00]: get rid of the excessive nutrients if
we've been feeding bottled nutrients Let's
[SPEAKER_00]: wash all that out of there so that the
plant will then begin to Cannibalize and
[SPEAKER_00]: starve itself so that there are no
nutrients left in that plant so that when
[SPEAKER_00]: we cut it down We don't taste nutrients in
that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I used to preach It's what a
lot of growers used to preach that has
[SPEAKER_00]: been the idea the philosophy the school of
thought for many many Years now at this
[SPEAKER_00]: point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure that if I agree or believe in
the idea of flushing our plants I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: some notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to try to stick to them Of course,
I'm going to weigh freestyle off of that
[SPEAKER_00]: But let me start by the notes say I'm
still studying to determine if flushing is
[SPEAKER_00]: real I'm not even sure if I believe that
that's real my notes say you can flush the
[SPEAKER_00]: medium you can starve the plant and it
will cannibalize itself, but Here's the
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you flushing out?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the scientific or organic
chemistry background to really explain
[SPEAKER_00]: this in a scientific way But hear me out
go on this journey with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say that you are going to eat
me Okay, nobody wants to eat me,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just come along with me for the ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna taste terrible We already know
that but let's just say you were gonna eat
[SPEAKER_00]: me if you ate me right now Do you think I
would taste any differently?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you poured if you made me drink a
hundred gallons of water and piss a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: for a couple of days and then eat me Am I
going to taste any differently?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so Because all of the stuff
that I've eaten over the past however many
[SPEAKER_00]: years I've been alive however many days
however many meals I've had that has
[SPEAKER_00]: created me that has become skin blood
teeth hair eyeballs Fat that I've burned
[SPEAKER_00]: off which the plant is creating using
energy as well I've used that to it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that I ate are the building blocks
that made me who I am and not who I am but
[SPEAKER_00]: what I physically Am it created my
physical being the minimal amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: muscle that is here that came from the
things that I ate My skeletal structure my
[SPEAKER_00]: blood everything that's all in here this
bag of meat that I am as a human That's
[SPEAKER_00]: all from the food and the nutrients that I
have consumed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on me I got a little extra right now
because it was a good winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ate a whole lot for the winter I'm
burning that off in the summer,
[SPEAKER_00]: but my comparison is what are we flushing
out of these plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: The stuff that we the nitrogen phosphorus
potassium molybdenum Sulfur everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that we've put into these plants the 16
elements which they have absorbed have
[SPEAKER_00]: turned into plant It is now a stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is now a vascular system within the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is now branches It is leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is trichomes It has become all of these
other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has become it has been metabolized into
plant So I'm not sure what we really what
[SPEAKER_00]: I even thought we were flushing out of
that plant So I know that this could
[SPEAKER_00]: become a controversial episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be a topic That stirs up a lot
of controversy by the way get the comments
[SPEAKER_00]: going down there in the comment section
Please do type a long paragraph and let me
[SPEAKER_00]: know what you think about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I crazy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any real science?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have some bro science?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any thoughts inputs
information?
[SPEAKER_00]: Corrections comments concerns throw those
right down there down there in the YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what you guys think But I'm
really I don't know what we could possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: be flushing out the plant takes up food It
turns it into buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns it into leaves chlorophyll It
turns it into all of the things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: required to be a happy living plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It creates exudates Those exudates come
out in the soil the microbes interact with
[SPEAKER_00]: those repeat process basically in a much
much more fancier form That was the crude
[SPEAKER_00]: version, but I don't know what we could
possibly be flushing out It's not like the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients the the cal mag the nitrogen
bottle the phosphorus bottle the bloom
[SPEAKER_00]: booster bottle that we fed the plant it's
not like we poured those into a can and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're still just existing there to lose
as bottled nutrients or even Maybe into a
[SPEAKER_00]: little baggie and we got nitrogen and
phosphorus molecules just hanging out in
[SPEAKER_00]: the bag I don't think that's the way that
it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think all of that stuff has been
However, you want to put it science terms
[SPEAKER_00]: bro science terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been turned into Digested processed
metabolized and it is now plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can flush out I don't really think we
can flush out the Nutrients and the things
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant you'd have to it's not like a
sponge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't just rinse it out You can't just
clean it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it works that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Maybe that's a conference controversial
ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's a controversial idea,
but I don't know that flushing really does
[SPEAKER_00]: anything So if you don't believe me if you
want to argue with me if you want to back
[SPEAKER_00]: me up support me I appreciate either one
of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love free-thinking human beings.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a beautiful thing But I challenge
you in your garden grow two plants the
[SPEAKER_00]: same the same everything the same clone
Don't do it from seed get a clone have two
[SPEAKER_00]: clones put them in the same type of soil
put them Not in the middle of the light
[SPEAKER_00]: but off-center of the light both of them
one to the left one to the right to where
[SPEAKER_00]: they're getting Basically equal amount of
light feed them the exact same thing
[SPEAKER_00]: Lollipop them pop and twist them any way
that you normally would do the exact same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing to both of these plants treat them
like they are twin brother twin sisters
[SPEAKER_00]: Love them both exactly the same then
here's where we're going to get scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this extreme so that we really
see a difference in case there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make sure we don't miss it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's Flush one plant for 14 solid days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's excessively flush it maybe in most
cases I consider a flush a lot of you have
[SPEAKER_00]: the wrong idea on how to flush also let me
touch on that a lot of people think that a
[SPEAKER_00]: flush is by Completely over watering that
plant till all kinds of water is falling
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the bottom and you got a big mess
of just Runny drippy plant with mud coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not a flush That's an over water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that if that's what you want to
do But that's an over water in my opinion
[SPEAKER_00]: an end of harvest or an end of flower ring
flush a pre harvest flush is just water it
[SPEAKER_00]: until you get Somewhere between 10 and 30%
runoff if you can pour in a gallon of
[SPEAKER_00]: water and get a quarter gallon or runoff
out of your pot That would be perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an easy amount of water to dispose
of to manage It's not going to be a big
[SPEAKER_00]: deal You don't need to go run in 10
gallons of water through a 3 gallon pot at
[SPEAKER_00]: one time What you want to do is water it
till you get runoff So you know you've
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaned out that soil then let it dry like
you normally would however long it
[SPEAKER_00]: normally takes then Repeat that process as
many times as possible over a 14-day
[SPEAKER_00]: process if you do flush That's the way to
do it if you do choose to flush that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: way that I recommend to do it So take one
plant give it that 14-day flush process
[SPEAKER_00]: with just water You can pH that water if
you want don't pH it if you don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: that part doesn't matter to me I've got a
whole nother school of thought on that We
[SPEAKER_00]: pH so that the plants will take up
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want them to take up nutrients,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't pH it, it's not gonna take up
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why bother adjusting?
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my theory there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna get the water that they need
they won't get more food if you are a
[SPEAKER_00]: flush person so Do the flush phase to one
plant and don't flush the other one mark
[SPEAKER_00]: them if you're going to flush one and not
flush the other one put a little sticker
[SPEAKER_00]: or a little tag or something on the one
you are flushing and the one you're not so
[SPEAKER_00]: that you don't mix that up so once we've
completed the flowering phase and we have
[SPEAKER_00]: done this flushing process on one and we
have not flushed the other what really
[SPEAKER_00]: matters to me the most in my opinion This
is my personal opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown a lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've smoked a lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been around a little bit I've been in
big rooms little rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I participated in a lot of cultivating and
a lot of cultivation allegedly I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that drying and curing is more important
than flushing the drying and curing phase
[SPEAKER_00]: is where we get rid of that chlorophyll
That's where the chlorophyll gets removed
[SPEAKER_00]: from the flowers and the drying cure
process We seal it up the anaerobes begin
[SPEAKER_00]: to eat the chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: We open it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chlorophyll gas is released Once
again, that's the crude version but that
[SPEAKER_00]: drying and curing process in my opinion is
More important than the flushing process
[SPEAKER_00]: you can fix or completely ruin flowers in
the drying cure process You can take a
[SPEAKER_00]: crop that was grown Okay, and you can make
it pretty good by drying it properly You
[SPEAKER_00]: can also take a crop that was grown
superbly perfectly beautifully every
[SPEAKER_00]: attention paid to every detail all the way
up until harvest and you can ruin that
[SPEAKER_00]: shit and the first four to six hours Of
the drying cure process or within the
[SPEAKER_00]: first week of the drying cure process
Drying and curing is super important in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion more important more so than the
flushing phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm still curious I'm still skeptical
if flushing is even necessary is flushing
[SPEAKER_00]: real is flushing a myth is flushing bro
science at this point I kind of want to
[SPEAKER_00]: think that it's a bro science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see anything that supports it So
with all of that being said if you do
[SPEAKER_00]: choose to flush your plants that does
happen in the final 10 to 14 days of your
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering phase If you have a package of
your seeds says to go 77 days start that
[SPEAKER_00]: 14 days before the 77th day Let that 77th
day finish then tomorrow go in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: chop those plants down Now I do know that
I said a lot of controversial things here
[SPEAKER_00]: in just a couple of quick minutes I look
forward to your questions corrections
[SPEAKER_00]: comments and concerns Please do all of
that down there in the comment section in

constructive criticism Whatever you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: to say.
