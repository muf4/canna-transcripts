[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching and listening and
learning with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the show notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of cool links in there you
may have been looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I did say I was going to talk
about my favorite strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a seed breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do own a seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have had the honor, the privilege,
the pleasure, the headache also of working
[SPEAKER_00]: with a lot of strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do need to remind myself that sometimes
not all strains were champions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of bullshit that went
through our hands over the learning period
[SPEAKER_00]: of growing cannabis here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the honor and pleasure to work with
a lot of great strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked in commercial grow facilities
where we had sometimes up to 75,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe 100 different cultivars,
mother plants on premises at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had 100 different plants to learn,
to learn how they grow, learn how they
[SPEAKER_00]: smell, learn how they respond to
nutrients, learn how they react to cold,
[SPEAKER_00]: heat, lollipopping, topping, bottoming,
twisting, popping, random stresses that
[SPEAKER_00]: would be put on them through the
commercial cultivation facility and
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the pleasure to grow a lot of
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said a moment ago that I realized some
of those also were a headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those were not a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weird thing is that some of the plants
that were the worst headache put out some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the best fucking products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was always a good gamble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am, I digress is what my grandma used to
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the honor to grow a lot of different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: People often ask me, what is your favorite
strain that you've ever had?
[SPEAKER_00]: People always ask me, what's your favorite
strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really hard choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like asking me my favorite child.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Maya.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will always be Maya.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Maya.
[SPEAKER_00]: She knows she's my favorite, but asking my
favorite strain is really hard because
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes I like to smoke something
different during the day than I would in
[SPEAKER_00]: the evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that midday smoke has got to be
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and the nighttime in the evening,
when I'm done, when it's time to chill
[SPEAKER_00]: out, uh, scroll the internet, do whatever
you do sitting in the chair, playing with
[SPEAKER_00]: your phone, just relaxing, sitting at the
table, smoking dads, recording a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's when I want to hit some dabs
that are going to obliterate me some
[SPEAKER_00]: garlic scented, uh, some pungent cushy
kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just going to put me on my ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, early in the day, I need something
that is going to give me high,
[SPEAKER_00]: but make my brain work and function and
make me want to be around people and not
[SPEAKER_00]: make me want to go sit down and be lazy
and lethargic and let my brain drift off
[SPEAKER_00]: into Neverland.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to stay focused and going,
but I like to be buzzed and high and have
[SPEAKER_00]: just a little bit of a edge to where I
just put a smile on my face for no stupid
[SPEAKER_00]: reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I would smoke something like
the orangegasm or something that gets me
[SPEAKER_00]: the proper kind of high for the day or
lemon Jeffrey, uh, lemon Jeffrey and
[SPEAKER_00]: orangegasm are beautiful early day,
midday kind of smokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But later in the day, I want double dose
dark hollow, the machine, something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that to kind of just wreck me a little bit
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So picking my favorite strain is quite a
challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, also as the, the breeder, the grower,
the creator, I don't only consider the
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking aspect of a favorite strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think about the experience in the
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, how does it clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if a plant doesn't clone,
well, that can be a headache from the very
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get those healthy clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it veg?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, does it transplant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, does it deal with light?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, does it deal with changes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, does it go from the clone area to
the bedroom, to the bigger bedroom,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the flower room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it take all those transitions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, does the plant handle, like I said a
moment ago, all of the stresses and
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments and random bullshit that we
are going to throw at it in either a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial facility, my personal growth,
or perhaps even my breeding environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get put through a whole nother rigorous
round of testing that casting couch is
[SPEAKER_00]: even worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like a fucking ninja warrior
getting through that one to be in the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding room is that's, that's a whole
nother level of testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I'm just building you up to talk
about some of my favorite strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, on the list would be a rise
arises on the top of the list because the
[SPEAKER_00]: super potency hyper vigor, the way it
grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you need an Indica, if you need a
sativa, it's right in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever, whenever you smoke that
you're going to get the buzz you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find a phenotype that will do
exactly what you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read some reports on it that people
can't smoke it during the day because it
[SPEAKER_00]: puts them down too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some people can't smoke it at
night because it keeps them up too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's, that's, uh, people are getting
wrecked off of that weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really tremendous to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'm a huge fan of the lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course it's got my name in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, lemon Jeffrey is named after me at
that lemon turp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't know if you've been around for
a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is your first time watching,
or if you've watched a lot of episodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: here's a reminder in April of 2015,
I hit my head and got a traumatic brain
[SPEAKER_00]: injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I was going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of wanted to die because of that
brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have that desire or feeling
anymore, but I had some weird lingering
[SPEAKER_00]: effects from the brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, my body wouldn't regulate its
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get nervous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have glitches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like I was just skipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brain was just skipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd find myself in the kitchen and not
know why I was in the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be standing in the middle of the
office and not remember why I came in the
[SPEAKER_00]: office and a weird shit would happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would smoke lemon Jeffrey and all those
weird glitches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the weird skips would just go
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would all come together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The puzzle pieces of my brain would just
lock back together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a rise lemon Jeffrey, uh, those are
some of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the orange gasm, the orange
gasm is a great daytime smoke,
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm super proud of that because before
I made that, I was sitting at a table with
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody and I said, I'm going to cross
the golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to pollinate the or the platinum
tangy with the golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to call it orange gasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to smell like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the buzz we will get.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenotypes we will find, and I'm going to
call it this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's going to be a fucking
hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that before I put that strain out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The person that I talked that conversation
to is watching big up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're well shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but when I made those seeds,
we grew those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found exactly what I had anticipated,
exactly what I predicted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was super proud of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it was a market hit being a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put out a lot of products and I don't
know what the, uh, the public,
[SPEAKER_00]: the market, the community, the clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what they're going to love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what's going to pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what's going to get
overlooked and what's going to be a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The orange gasm fucking hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm super proud of that one for a lot
of different reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Jeffrey in the same aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not know that lemon Jeff was going
to be a banger and it is popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: The orange gasm, the lemon Jeffrey are two
of my most sought after in demand strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for you people to keep asking,
that sounds rude when you say you people
[SPEAKER_00]: for you kind, amazing folks who keep
asking and have enthusiasm and excitement
[SPEAKER_00]: about the lemon Jeff, the orange gasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the feminized golden goat S one seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if I said feminized, I shouldn't need
to say S one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was redundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Call me out on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you're the people that are excited
for those have no fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are not very big at this time,
but they are in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, since I'm limited by plant counts and
plant numbers, I'm going to veg them a
[SPEAKER_00]: little larger than normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I can't put more plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we used to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just shove more in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to make them bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to take a little bit longer
veg time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we will pollinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we will have good seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there's another secret feminized
project in the works that I haven't even
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are fem seeds coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I cut myself off from rambling,
the lemon Jeffrey, the orange gasm,
[SPEAKER_00]: the arise are some of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the one that this episode
is going to focus on because I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: rambling for long enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like one of my favorites,
one of the first strains that I made that
[SPEAKER_00]: really made me go, Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made me proud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made other people say, Hey, I really need
some of that was a strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I call the grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things we could talk
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do I love the grateful dog?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the first time I took the grateful dog
to a party, I was at a party.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just party and doing our normal
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, and someone's like,
Hey, anybody got any weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody looks at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm the guy around here that back
then this was like, uh, before medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana and recreational cannabis were
super popular and everybody had weed all
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was abundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, people wanted to smoke and everybody
just kind of did the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all stared my direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey white guy with dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was okay with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew I was known around here as being
the weed guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some new weed that I would love to
try with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I bust out my jar and I take off the
lid and everybody within like a three to
[SPEAKER_00]: six foot circumference goes, wow,
man, what do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people nine and 10 feet away
started going, what is that shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody gathered around and I'm
probably telling a fantastical story.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably a Burt Kreischer style
hyperbole, but this is what it felt like
[SPEAKER_00]: when I cracked open one of those nuggets
to roll a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody in the party came outside,
sat on the back porch and watched me roll
[SPEAKER_00]: that joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were drooling like Pavlov's dogs,
just waiting to smoke some of that weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if everybody was doing that
really, but that's how it felt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how that weed made me feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was drooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, this weed smells so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm used to smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in my environment, when you smoke at
your house and your car and your office at
[SPEAKER_00]: your studio, wherever you normally smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't notice all the details,
all the, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said earlier, I like to test it in my
office.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I notice everything, but maybe I
got too comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause when I took it somewhere else,
cracked it open and roll the joint and
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke that I noticed new Terps,
new flavors and a new buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when I was like, well,
this weed is special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And luckily I had made seeds of that weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a bunch of seeds of it and I
packaged up those seeds and I took those
[SPEAKER_00]: to the upcoming cannabis cup, the Denver
high time, the high times cannabis cup in
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one that was, uh, this was at
the, uh, the one after the ex toe,
[SPEAKER_00]: the one when they moved it to the,
uh, the Denver high time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bigger place there took it there,
uh, and passed out a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next year people were asking
for seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That strain that I was giving out was what
I was calling grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did the grateful dog come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do we want to talk more about why I was
in love with the grateful dog?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about why I fell in love with
the grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was something about the Terps,
the aroma, the flavor, the buzz that just
[SPEAKER_00]: made me go, Ooh, they just, it smelled
nasty and good at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: People hate it when I say it smells like
dirty feet, but it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smelled like dirty, funky feet and
skunk and chemicals, but then it also had
[SPEAKER_00]: a sweet berry bottom to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was dirty, dirty funk with this,
like, Ooh, what is that at the end of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a question mark of,
huh, did you put, did you put some skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: weed on a grape blunt wrap?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a weird after fruity taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also loved it because I've spoke about
this earlier as the grower, it grew with
[SPEAKER_00]: nice vigor, nice structure, nice shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the buds were great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it was very, uh, resistant to
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes back then I was known to get a,
that room that that plant was grown in was
[SPEAKER_00]: prone to get powdery mildew at one part of
the year, about this part of the year,
[SPEAKER_00]: every year when the seasons would change,
you have days that are like, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the high seventies and then the nights
are like the low fifties.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit was giving us powdery mildew
before I learned how to correct that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grateful dog wasn't getting the
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was loving that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it would turn purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would turn crazy colors and then it
would give us nice, big fat harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was paying the weight and then it was
a good breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a breeder, everything I've bred it to
has made pretty impressive plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The morning dew comes from the grateful
dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there are some other fem things that
come from the grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't say too many things because a
lot of those are sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The morning dew is available.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest, uh, not so much available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there may be some Jack the ripper,
grateful dog crosses coming in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should not have even said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get myself back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about why I loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is this damn grateful dog plant that
I keep alluding to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me try to put that out there one
more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause my brain was stumbling and my mouth
was stuttering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is chem 91 cross two, the San Fernando
Valley Kush F four, the SFV OG F four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that also is known as deadhead OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the seed as a deadhead OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew out a pack of deadhead OG seeds and
I numbered them.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite one in the bunch was number
nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why that matters,
but that is the one I selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took number nine and I reversed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took two clones of number nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I treated one with the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a full episode on the reversal
treated one with the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pollinated the other clone of number
nine seeds came out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds got labeled the grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is where the grateful dog came
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a reversed deadhead OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where it originated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So out of that batch of deadhead OG S ones
came a keeper that got labeled the
[SPEAKER_00]: grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one of my favorite plants ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds that were released from that
were that plant self.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would self the grateful dog plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would self that to itself and put out
the seeds from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later on, I decided to take the pollen
from the original grateful dog mom,
[SPEAKER_00]: the number nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put that pollen on my favorite
grateful dog keeper that I had made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one got labeled GD 77.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about these names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grateful dog is a Grateful Dead offshoot
band.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is David Grisman and Jerry Garcia.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do some acoustic Grateful Dead stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do some bluegrass style stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do some creative, eclectic type of
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was where Grateful Dog came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grateful Dog was a Grateful Dead offshoot,
a Jerry Garcia side project with David
[SPEAKER_00]: Grisman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since it came from deadhead OG,
it got called the Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a deadhead OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: S one, I selected the plant out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now from the Grateful Dog, I took the
pollen from the original deadhead OG that
[SPEAKER_00]: I reversed, put that pollen on my Grateful
Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have now created GD 77.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why GD 77?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because 1977 is my favorite year of the
Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Grateful Dead was around for several,
several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: 77 is one of my favorite years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got real psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got trippy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put out some great albums, great songs
around that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shows from the spring run of 77 that
may run the Betty boards.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody, any dead heads out there know
what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit is awesome to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five eight 77 is one of my favorite shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five 22 77 all of that run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I'm rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're not a deadhead,
that doesn't mean any shit to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Pembroke Pines Florida show was so
hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 77 GD number 77 is why that got called
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now just to recap, because I did get
rambling and I want to make sure that I
[SPEAKER_00]: said this correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took the deadhead OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I selfed it from those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That winner got labeled the Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that is the Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds that went out for retail that
were given away at the cannabis cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Grateful Dog selfed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I selfed that one and put those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then eventually I took the pollen from the
original deadhead OG and put it on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Grateful Dog that I had selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: The winner that I had been reversing again
and putting out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put the original pollen on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't sure what I was doing at the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is sort of a feminized back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I put the pollen on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That created GD 77.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was deadhead OG selfed that made the
Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I put the pollen from the deadhead
back on the Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds that came from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite keeper is DH 70 or GD 77.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about number
77.
[SPEAKER_00]: 77 has a hard time being reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have hit it with the whole bottle of
silver thiosulfate and that plant does not
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not want to give me pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have not been able to breed much with
77 as a pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been given pollen but it has never
given me pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one is super stingy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be stingy Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: 77 is not going to give me any pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will not be bred with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can only use it as a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is number 77.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I think I made it clear where the
deadhead OG, the Grateful Dog and 77 have
[SPEAKER_00]: come from through the magic of editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be super clear by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the way that this conversation came up
is we were talking about genetics in a
[SPEAKER_00]: forum and somebody asked me how the
Grateful Dog ended up in some of Colin's
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses from ethos genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colin and I are both here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a very great story that a lot
of people have been waiting for around the
[SPEAKER_00]: story of how the Grateful Dog came from my
hands and got to Colin's hands to make the
[SPEAKER_00]: Colin OG and a few other crosses that I
think ethos has made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a really fun story for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The official story of how Colin ended up
with my Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Colin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to the ethos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the whole gang.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holding it down over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inspiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright here is how they got my Grateful
Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the official story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gather around the campfire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at a reggae concert at Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure it was reggae on the
rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big surprise right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Another surprise I cannot remember which
year it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could probably do some research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do some scrolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: The exact year is not important for my
story right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe Revolution was playing at
reggae on the rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a lot of years but at that
concert I was smoking a bunch of joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I go to concerts I roll up a bunch of
joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a lot of joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day you had to sneak your weed
into Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not let you take weed in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you got it in there you could do
whatever you wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they would search you down quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my theory, my strategy was to roll a
bunch of joints and put them in every
[SPEAKER_00]: pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every spot on my body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they find these I still got these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they find these I still got these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would get a bunch of joints into
Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This lucky day all of my joints made it
into Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm at my spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The band is playing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm smoking joints after joints after
joints because that's how you do it at a
[SPEAKER_00]: reggae concert at Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would light up one joint and as soon as
it got done I'd flick the roach and just
[SPEAKER_00]: light up another joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I smoked I don't know probably 10 or
12 joints before my favorite band that I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Revolution was probably my favorite band
at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm smoking a lot of joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this guy next to me is lighting joints
and smoking them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time I light a joint he lights
another joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time I light a joint he lights
another joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I notice he's trying to, it's a
friendly smoke competition sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually he leans over and he goes,
man your weed smells really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, thank you bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, what do you got there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go, it's called the Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, I never heard of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I bred that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he seemed skeptical at first,
you know, which is at the time everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: was a grower, a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody was getting into the illegal
weed scene right then.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when it was just cracking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course he was like, yeah,
White Guy, Dreadlocks, reggae concert,
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking of course you breed some weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand the skepticism because he
replied with, well, I own this dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, yeah, probably,
maybe not, sure, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're both like feeling each other
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we bullshitting each other?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we actually?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he said a few things about the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, that's an actual
fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of know that about that place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I can divulge where he worked and
said that he was the owner.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said he was the owner of Mile High
Green Cross in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had just won the Cannabis Cup for
the Banana Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won first place for a Banana Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the year, if you're looking for
research to see which year this story
[SPEAKER_00]: happened, it was the year that Mile High
Green Cross won the Banana Kush and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right around that time period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right after that was a Red Rocks,
reggae on the rocks concert with
[SPEAKER_00]: Revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where it happened in the middle of
Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also side note, I like to sit behind the
sound booth or right in front of the sound
[SPEAKER_00]: booth at Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get right in front of or behind
the sound board, there are a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: great reasons, advantages for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, the sound guy's ears are
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to sound the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be where the sound guy's ears are and you
get the best sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: He dialed it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's hearing it right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to sound good right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also at the sound booth, you have a good
likelihood of seeing some of the artists.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a tunnel that runs from under the
stage at Red Rocks down to the sound
[SPEAKER_00]: booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when some of the artists get done
playing, they go cruise through the tunnel
[SPEAKER_00]: and end up in the sound booth to watch
their friends in the next band play.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've met a lot of reggae artists just
hanging out by the booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just got done playing and they
ended up back there to watch the next
[SPEAKER_00]: band.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've hung out with Morgan Heritage,
Steel Pulse, lots of fucking bands just
[SPEAKER_00]: because I knew how to do that right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get myself back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're smoking a lot of joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy claims to own Mile High Green
Cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I claim to have bred this weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy is like, I'd really like to get a
clone of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, Oh man, I don't really
give out clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wasn't giving out clones at the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't selling clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he goes, I'd give you a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time that was kind of unheard
of in my, uh, in my realm, in my world,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my business, in my, my status,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like $$$$ for a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, here's my name, my number,
my address, my Facebook, my Instagram,
[SPEAKER_00]: my social security number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's how you find me, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to give me $$$ for a clone,
we are going to be friends forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he introduced himself and we became
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't like to bring too many
people's business, too many other people
[SPEAKER_00]: into my story right now, because it's not,
uh, it's not, they're not here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't be friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not, I don't know if it's their
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're my, if I'm sharing someone else's
business, but that was my friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: Noah, big up to Noah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may watch this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may hear this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't say your last name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to, uh, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think of them all as one word.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is one word, but big up to my
buddy, Noah, Noah, uh, was involved with
[SPEAKER_00]: mile high green cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he bought a clone of the grateful dog
from me for $$$ cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, um, he came to get the clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: He met me at my house and he bought the
clone from me and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, at the time, I will admit my clone
tech was garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not very good at cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my buddy, Noah was like, bro,
you need to learn how to use an easy
[SPEAKER_00]: cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, an easy cloner teach me
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he showed me his easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: He showed me pictures and I was like,
that's fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he's like, I want a bunch more
cuts from you because you have good
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, I've got an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bring me an easy cloner and I will let
you cut clones out of my garden and fill
[SPEAKER_00]: up the easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when they're ready, you can come get
the cuts and leave the cloner here at his
[SPEAKER_00]: mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in exchange for cuts, he taught me how
to set up and run the easy clone clone
[SPEAKER_00]: machine and brought me the big,
like a 90 cider or a 60 site clone
[SPEAKER_00]: machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, that was a really good deal
for both of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a teaching lesson on how to cut
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I can cut clones like a Savage and
one of those easy cloners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he got some really good genetics and
we built a solid relationship because he
[SPEAKER_00]: would bring me a lot of good cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the action Bronson cut that I used,
uh, that came from, that came from my
[SPEAKER_00]: buddy, Noah, some of the.
[SPEAKER_00]: The prodigy on that I used in the,
the profit that came from Noah also was an
[SPEAKER_00]: ethos cut shot out to ethos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the stuff I got came from our
friend Noah at mile high green cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: He ended up with the grateful dog cut was
the moral of part of that story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there is more of the saga does
continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did want to make sure to give him a
shout out for teaching me how to cut
[SPEAKER_00]: clones in the easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude stepped up my game.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then he actually came to my house with
the machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We set it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he literally went.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through my mother room and cut clones at
his will.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let him have run of basically whatever
he wanted in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He cut the clones, put them in the cloner,
showed me how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: We filled up the cloner kept them alive
for long enough to get roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he came and picked it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He took the cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We potted the cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then he left the cloner and we've
been friends ever since and doing stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, ever since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, um, I'm not sure where the clone
went from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clone was put into a commercial
cultivation facility in Denver,
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that it went to mile high green
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know it had to have gone to another
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: The commercial cultivations are not in the
same building as the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you work for mile high green cross,
it goes to your cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, you can spread it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, you could just spread it
out wherever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that grateful dog clone landed in the
hands of my new friend, Noah, that I met
[SPEAKER_00]: at a reggae on the rocks concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: He bought the clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has now got the clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once he's got the clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably asked him, don't do much with
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my pride and joy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as someone that gives out a clone who
gave, he gave me money for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He could do basically whatever he wants,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's his, that's his plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can make clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can breed to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He could play with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was in a commercial cultivation
facility, which got sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just how the industry works.
[SPEAKER_00]: People will sell their cultivation if they
want to buy another one or sell too small
[SPEAKER_00]: and buy a big one, or sometimes licenses
just sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes people get bored of being in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cultivation in which that plant was
got sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you sell the facility,
the plants come with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't go clear out the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just give them, here's everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You keep it moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new ownership takes over a running
machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way there's no downtime,
no stalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's just a cordial way to do
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the facility was sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if it was sold to another
person who I didn't know at the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: but later on became a good friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would almost call him a mentor and a
teacher is definitely a teacher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, kind of a mentor to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know him at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he may have purchased the facility
from my friend, Noah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it was directly sold to Colin or one of
Colin's partners from ethos there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know those details.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's none of my, it's not really my
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't do a lot of research there,
but the clone went from Noah to a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial facility, his facility that got
sold to a guy by another guy with the
[SPEAKER_00]: initials of possibly RJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're watching, if you're old school,
if you worked at three rivers,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know who I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name does not need to be out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to possibly RJ then to Colin from
ethos or Colin's team.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how Colin from ethos acquired my
grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: From there, uh, he made, uh, the Colin OG
from it, which has been a hugely
[SPEAKER_00]: successful strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that my friends is the story of how
Colin Gordon of ethos ended up with the
[SPEAKER_00]: grateful dog clone to the best of my
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to start any beef,
stir up any shit with any misinformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I said something wrong, misspoke,
that's cause I'm a stone or in detail,
[SPEAKER_00]: slipped through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got nothing but love and respect for
everybody involved in that story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, big up to Noah, big up to Noah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the other guy labeled RJ big up to our
buddy, uh, Colin and the entire team at
[SPEAKER_00]: ethos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, that is basically what I've got
for that story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I made it from a dead head OG seed,
uh, found a selection from their self that
[SPEAKER_00]: put those seeds out, got inspired to put
the pollen from the original onto my
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring, because that's just weird shit
that breeders do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that made number 77, 77 hasn't gone
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that stays in my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got seeds in a clone of that,
uh, met my buddy Noah at a reggae concert
[SPEAKER_00]: sold in the clone big up to Noah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That clone either went directly to,
uh, Colin or it went to a middle man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it is all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been bred to, um, that's the story
and I'm sticking to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions, corrections,
comments, concerns, updates, positive
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback, uh, you want to know more
details, you have specific questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to entertain those things.
