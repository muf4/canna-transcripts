[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the podcast, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 807 of the grow from your
heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a fun show lined up for you in this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to give away free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give away free iry genetic
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more about that in this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick reminder, if you are owed free
seeds, please send me a reminder and put
[SPEAKER_00]: the word prizes in the subject line that
will help me find your free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get those out to you right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I want to give a big shout out to
everybody who gave me some love some
[SPEAKER_00]: compliments and some feedback on the new
intro to the podcast through Natalie rise
[SPEAKER_00]: in there on the last episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all the feedback on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a lot of effort, a lot of time and
energy and work into those intros to so to
[SPEAKER_00]: get all that feedback feels good makes it
worth all my time and energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, let's talk about the groovy gravy
secret stash coming up this weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I wait to see everybody there?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you come to my booth and buy a pack of
seeds, the first 120 ish people to buy a
[SPEAKER_00]: pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get a free tester pack of P 91 cross
to jack the ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you got to do is buy a pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop by the booth to see what's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannot wait to see you guys at the secret
stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, where do we go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it's time to jump into
everybody's favorite part of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do the email portion of today's
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message came from the iry direct iry
genetics website, the grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to my website, there are a bunch
of tabs up there at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them says grow help click on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can send me a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's first question came from our
friend Michael McCoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes Hey Rasta Jeff, I have lemon
Jeffrey maize and morning dew that I have
[SPEAKER_00]: purchased from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have an early stage of thrips and I've
started treatment with neem oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been spraying every other day for a
few days now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I still feed my plants, even though I
am treating them with neem oil,
[SPEAKER_00]: I use Remo nutrients, and the plants are
right around a month old.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a case of thrips,
you've been spraying neem oil every other
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, that neem oil is going to
start causing more problems than those
[SPEAKER_00]: thrips, I would settle down on the neem
oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I don't recommend or use neem oil
at all in my grow neem oil is banned in
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial production in Colorado,
I would recommend a more strategic
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also do a research on why neem oil
is not recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of side effects to neem
oil you may not want to be involved in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would recommend switching
pesticides, I would recommend something
[SPEAKER_00]: like evergreen or azimax, or even Monterey
garden spray with spinosad, that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: that'd be much more beneficial and useful
than the neem oil, the name is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: start suffocating the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make your plants taste like
shit when you smoke them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would switch that up and stop
spraying every other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little bit excessive,
you're going to start clogging up those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, they can't breathe, that will
cause more problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, other than sprays, I would consider
a soil dredge drench that soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: those, those thrips are living a little
bit in the leaves, but at nighttime,
[SPEAKER_00]: they go down and they sleep and they make
shelter in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe treat that soil, consider that as
well, also do a little bit of defoliation
[SPEAKER_00]: down there at the bottom of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main question was, should I be feeding
these plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they need all the food, all the
energy they can get, even though they're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting attacked by bugs and you're
spraying them, they still do need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: fed, they need energy, they need
nutrition, just like you do, you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: battle bugs, you can't grow, you can't
live your life if you don't eat,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants are the same way, so you've got
to feed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would definitely focus on getting
rid of those thrips, defoliate,
[SPEAKER_00]: rotate your pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been spraying neem every other
day for a few days now, they're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: used to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just imagine if you woke up every day and
I sprayed some funky chemical in your
[SPEAKER_00]: face, the first day you'd go, oh,
that fucking sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: By day three, you'd go, that's kind of
terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: By about the eighth day, you'd go,
yeah, there's that fucking spray again,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you just get up and go about your day,
your thrips are doing that with your neem
[SPEAKER_00]: oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first day they went, oh God,
that's a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: By now they're going, yeah, there's that
neem oil again, and they're making babies
[SPEAKER_00]: that are prepared for neem oil,
they've just evolved, you've got super
[SPEAKER_00]: thrips now, you've got to switch up your,
your strategy, multiple modes of attack,
[SPEAKER_00]: attack the soil, attack the leaves,
do some defoliating, and then hit it with
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple pesticides in a rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my dude, Mr. McCoy,
you have won a free pack of seeds since I
[SPEAKER_00]: did read your message here on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please send me your shipping address with
a real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to send stuff to people with
weird stoner names, so put a real name on
[SPEAKER_00]: there, I'll ship that package to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were in the States, if you're in
Canada, you are going to win a t-shirt or
[SPEAKER_00]: a hoodie or something like that,
because the Canadian government does not
[SPEAKER_00]: want any more iry genetic seeds going past
the border.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do send me your address.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the subject line, please do put prizes
so that I know why you're sending me a
[SPEAKER_00]: message, and then I can find that much
more easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's keep rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We finally got a good rhythm going.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next message also came from the Grow
Help tab on the iry genetics website.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from somebody that wants to
be called Andrew, and the question goes
[SPEAKER_00]: just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Rasta Jeff, how are you my guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, I'm high as giraffe pussy,
I'm having a good day, got a lot of stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: done, I was hanging out on Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join us on Discord, it's a good time,
but all is well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I'm a fairly new listener and a
first-time writer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the gang, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, my wife is having some new
problems with severe panic attacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had panic attacks before,
kind of crippling, makes you feel totally
[SPEAKER_00]: weird and out of place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I know how much you care and how
much knowledge you have on everything
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, so my question starts here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which strain or strains do you recommend
from your lineup to start as a baseline if
[SPEAKER_00]: this issue continues?
[SPEAKER_00]: With my wife, I'm going to have to shoot
my shot at breeding her something special,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I need to do a lot more research
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend Andrew, luckily I've done a lot
of breeding and a lot of work to get you a
[SPEAKER_00]: head start.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not have to breed your own plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be something in my lineup that
will definitely help with your wife's
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is, with cannabis and with most
medicines, it's all going to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: first of all, it's going to be plant
specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll say it's plant phenotype specific,
but it's also body chemistry specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that I smoke make my heart race,
and they make me calm down and normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things that make Mike normal make me
lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about our different body
chemistry and how our brains and bodies
[SPEAKER_00]: react to different terpenes, cannabinoids,
esters, all the compounds in the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: which we are smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can make some recommendations,
but I've got to recommend on totally
[SPEAKER_00]: opposite ends of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: You try one thing, and it's either going
to fix her anxiety or she's going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: the worst panic attack of her life while
she's high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if that's the case, you've got to go
to the other end of the spectrum,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that one's either going to fix her or,
like I said, she's going to have a panic
[SPEAKER_00]: attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, the way to figure this
out, I think, is to just smoke a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: different things and see which one works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me make some recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a traumatic brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk just a little bit about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit my head right here, right about
where the headphones sit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dinged my head pretty good in 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going down some stairs to get a
chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the doorway had to be about 6'2",
because I'm 6'5", and that shit hit me
[SPEAKER_00]: right here, clipped me super good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was out immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bounced down the stairs on the back of
my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I woke up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of knew where I was and who I was,
but that was about all the details I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know why I was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at a Friends Going Away party.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not say goodbye to them,
to the best of my knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember, but I've got some weird
effects from that traumatic brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been about 15 years, I guess,
to eight years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: See?
[SPEAKER_00]: Brain injury effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, when I smoke lemon Jeffrey and
plants with high limonene turps,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of the skips and clogs and brain
issues, they kind of subside and go away
[SPEAKER_00]: with the lemon Jeffrey and high limonene
turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack the Ripper helps me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, Jack the Ripper gives some of my
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy, Petro, can't smoke Jack the
Ripper because he gets fucking extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: high and wants to have a major panic
attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, those turps do a really good
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: For other people, it puts them on the
edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I would recommend is the
lemon Jeffrey, though, because that makes
[SPEAKER_00]: my little problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely helps them go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then another product from my lineup that
works to put everybody in a good mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my daily smokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's daytime, if I want to get some
shit done, but also kind of just have a
[SPEAKER_00]: little buzz, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not get super wrecked and go sit on the
couch, but a little little dishes energy,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little vacuum energy, because vacuuming
and doing the dishes sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I smoke some orangegasm,
bro, we'll do all the dishes and not even
[SPEAKER_00]: give a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be looking for other dishes to clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take out the trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll mop the floor just because I'm so
blazed on orangegasm that it's a good day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing could go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lemon Jeffrey and orangegasm are
two that I would definitely recommend to
[SPEAKER_00]: start testing out anxiety for my strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you got to hang out with her because
these could also, it could backfire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I talked about my brain chemistry,
her brain chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be way different or it could be
completely the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me read some of my notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the JTR crosses, I should
mention this, maybe way too much for some
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the Jack the Ripper crosses may be
beautiful for some people with anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I smoke it, it makes my brain right.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Petro smokes it, he just gets fucking
racy and freaked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go light with the Jack the Ripper
stuff, but some of it may really work for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the limonene and the lemon Jeffrey,
the orangegasm and the Jack the Ripper
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff doesn't work for you at all,
I would try Big Mountain Fudge Cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the totally opposite end of the
spectrum for my breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Completely different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that one would work well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got just a heavy feeling to it when
you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can find a pack of Moon Tower,
that would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to make those again,
but maybe something with some bubba
[SPEAKER_00]: cushion there may be good for the anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one calms me down, makes me super
chill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I melt in the couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one, that's movie weed for me if I
got to chill and watch a movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll work into some of the Arise
crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get weird feedback on the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some people, the Arise makes them
shoot up and get a bunch of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some people, the Arise makes them melt
into the couch and chill out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise crosses may be good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the specific crosses I wrote down
were Firefly, Sun Kiss, Moon Tower,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Dark Hollow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those may be great crosses for you to try
for the anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it sucks that I'm just giving you
this big plate of options.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to buy stuff and grow
it and try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with cannabis, like I keep saying,
it's all about your body, your terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what's going to work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is still something we're learning and
something I'm definitely learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to learn it with us
and take a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you smoke something right down,
I smoked Lemon Jeffrey and I felt good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a remarkable experience most
of the time, people will remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know somebody that got way too high on
Lemon Wreath and every time they see a jar
[SPEAKER_00]: of Lemon Wreath, they leave the room just
because they know that that was a bad
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I smell tequila, I remember that
fucking experience vividly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe try the Big Mountain Fudge Cakes
and Bubba Kush sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the last thing I wrote down is Purple
Heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a strain called Purple Heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: That strain was made for veterans with
PTSD, night terrors, and anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one should be great for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is you're not going to get any
of the psychedelic fun head buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to be mostly calming,
which may be what your wife is looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing about Purple Heart is it is not
available on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not available commercially anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to contact me for the Purple
Heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately, you wrote a message that got
read on my show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe you a free pack of seeds anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please send me your address.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a little note that this is for
your wife with anxiety issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it as a prize on the show and I
will pack you up a special pack of Purple
[SPEAKER_00]: Heart seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any ready to go right now,
but this message does deserve a pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple Heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to get you one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll send you a more Sativa dominant
strain to get you started.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could try both ends of the spectrum,
see if that works, then reach out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know how it goes and I will do my
best to adjust my recommendations based on
[SPEAKER_00]: your feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get your wife dialed in,
get her anxiety free so that she can enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: her life and you can enjoy your wife and
your life together.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dude, he wraps it up though.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says with much love from Andrew PS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being such a positive
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Andrew, thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for getting me the opportunity
to help you and the wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to getting your address and
I look forward to getting some feedback on
[SPEAKER_00]: the strains that I send your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, ladies and gentlemen,
I've got another message here on the
[SPEAKER_00]: table.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from a friend who wants to
be called.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't put a name so you don't get to
be called anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about we just call you Jamie?
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friend Jamie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a frequent flyer on your emails and I
really appreciate when a busy man like
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself finds time to respond to me,
but I'm just a normal person living the
[SPEAKER_00]: dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for making that dream possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says quick off topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your lemon Jeffries are in day 42 and wow,
what an explosive plant, but I try to warn
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants veg like monsters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go super fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the branches are definitely being
supported with bamboo sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, everything would be horizontal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta give him some support.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get beefy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get heavy and they will fall over.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good sign, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means you got some big fat chunky
buds, which is what we all want.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said I heard this on your nutrient
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've heard this from experience
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are careful, you can raise your PK
booster dose slightly higher than normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are careful and know what you're
doing, that's absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know what to look for, you can push
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got a good eye, if you can identify
a nutrient burn, if it's nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus, potassium, whatever you're
overdoing, because then things are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see deficiencies and
overfeeds at the same time if you go too
[SPEAKER_00]: hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you know what you're doing and know
what to look for, you can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says, what are the precursor
signs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of nutrient burn to look out for when
doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now I am raising shine to two and a
half grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good move right there,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go slow, but do keep raising it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Says I don't want to get any further than
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even watering up to one to two grams seems
to be working like a charm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of sounds like common sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slowly acclimate your plants to a higher
dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because is it because more taller?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sentence is hard to read because more
tolerant if you do it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that makes sense now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a thought of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a fact I looked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that makes total sense, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like just like I talked about the
bugs earlier that are building resistance,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're getting stronger every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants are going, oh, he gave me two
grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can handle two grams the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You give him two point one and they go,
yeah, it's a little push.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what to do with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you jump up immediately, they may freak
out and go, oh, that was way too much,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they may fry up on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally does make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main question here was, how can I tell
if my plants are getting overfed?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to push them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing I usually talk about when
our plants are getting overfed is what I
[SPEAKER_00]: call their fingernails getting done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just imagine the leaves on your plants or
the fingers of a lady and they got their
[SPEAKER_00]: fingernails done.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're starting to just look a little bit
crispy at the tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the first sign to look for of an
overfed plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those tips will start getting,
they may turn brown, they may turn yellow,
[SPEAKER_00]: they may get crispy, but right at the tip
of all the big leaves, that's where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to notice it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most likely where you're going to notice
it first with most nutrient issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to see the nails getting
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they may get pale up the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see that pale up the middle,
you may think you need to feed something
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because everything is out of whack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop feeding so much, kind of pull back a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see crispy tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see leaves starting to curl.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may get kind of crispy, papery,
leathery, and then just start throwing up
[SPEAKER_00]: gang signs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're throwing up gang signs saying,
fuck you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fix me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may just see leaves that are weirdly
dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is wet, but there are just a few
leaves on there that are dry and crispy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a sign of either overfeed or a
nutrient or a pH problem, which when you
[SPEAKER_00]: start overfeeding, you do create pH
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you start fighting the pH problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start overfeeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you throw everything all out of
whack.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to start fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as those leaf tips start looking
like they're burnt, maybe dial back just a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit, or, or maybe just keep going
just like you are, unless it gets worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like just a little touch of burnt tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell you, you know, you're fucking
pushing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like they're sweating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're starting to get ripped in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we want from these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to put them in turbo mode,
but we don't want to burn them up like a
[SPEAKER_00]: rocket ship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also other things to look out for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some more notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much nitrogen in flower, especially in
early flower, will start to make your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants a little bit stretchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of building buds, they'll get
taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll just start making a lot of fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the bud sites are, there will be a
lot of space and they'll never fill in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because you're feeding too much
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the, this happens in dog walker,
especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: This happens in white walker.
[SPEAKER_00]: This happens in a lot of the, a lot of
the, the cushier, what am I saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: The chem dog strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice this in, if you overfeed
them, instead of making that one big
[SPEAKER_00]: donkey dick color right at the top,
you'll get a bunch of golf balls that make
[SPEAKER_00]: what I call the stairway.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get one bud here, one bud here,
one bud here, and they just kind of rotate
[SPEAKER_00]: around the plant and make a spiral
staircase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It never really fills in the way that it
could have if you didn't overfeed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the chem dogs and cushy stuff,
they will react that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you overfeed them also on some of the
more sativa stuff, you might start seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: excessive Fox tailing that can be from
overfeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could be a sign to look out for,
but that's going to be like on a longer
[SPEAKER_00]: finishing plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice they're starting to just
create more growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because the plant's getting so
much nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going, Hey, maybe, maybe I'm going to
just keep on going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it starts spitting out new growth,
turning light green, looking a little Fox
[SPEAKER_00]: tailing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my dude, I think I answered
your question quite thoroughly here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the continued correspondence
and the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, please do send me an email with
your shipping address and your real name
[SPEAKER_00]: so I can get you out a free pack of irie
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, do put prizes in the subject
line so I can find those prizes,
[SPEAKER_00]: send those out and get everybody caught
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do all you prizes and you haven't got
them, please send me a gentle reminder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent out about 20 packs yesterday and
the day before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it was the day before that,
but I sent out a bunch of packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, they should be getting to you
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think I owe you seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more message to read here on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is the one we're going to do
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it was called the man with no name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's easy enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friend, the man with
no name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey bro, I owe you a free pack of seeds,
but please do send me a name because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's how I can label the box and get it
to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the drill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said it enough times.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question goes if if I put a male plant
that was about to release pollen under 18,
[SPEAKER_00]: six light cycle for two weeks,
would it continue to throw pollen or would
[SPEAKER_00]: it stop immediately?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a quick answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take a little while for that
plant to say, oh, you've changed the
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've changed shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will change too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once it decides to change,
it's got to adjust all the hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will take a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, male plants are a little more
difficult to stop flowering and revege
[SPEAKER_00]: than a female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just just seems to be the case in my
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've reveged a lot of plants, males and
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've sex tested a lot of plants by putting
them under 1212 and tried to flip them
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: The males are always the most stubborn to
go back in my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he will take a little while to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe at least a week, maybe 10,
maybe 14, maybe 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: Days depending on a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: How far into flower did he get?
[SPEAKER_00]: It says he's about to release pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's already there, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to get him to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that feeling, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's about to let it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to get him to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to stop when you're that
close, either does he.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to take quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how far into flower you
went.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on what you're feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also depends on the spectrum and
intensity of your light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's getting sunlight, it may revege
much more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's getting like a weak T5 light,
it's going to take a lot longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe impossible without enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a second part to the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says thank you in advance for answering
my question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are clearly the man.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dude, thank you for sending a great
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the continued support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I got time for one more question.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was going to be the last one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked over.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't gone nearly long enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's bang out one more bonus question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should put up some graphics bonus
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's obnoxious.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one also came from the Grow Help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend Hemptoed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my buddy Hemptoed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey bro, you know the drill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do send me your email or your
shipping address so that I can get you a
[SPEAKER_00]: free pack of irie genetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's groovy Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is groovy, baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're having a good day,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says you can call me Hemptoed and
then he gives me another name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also says your preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going with Hemptoed, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the coolest name I've seen all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says how are you holding up,
man, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hanging out with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm almost done with the work for the
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a bunch of good friends watching on
Discord right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the Discord gang that's
watching me record this live, then hanging
[SPEAKER_00]: out with them a lot, taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite you to come join us on Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the cool kids are over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message says I want to start off by
saying thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it wasn't for you on the podcast,
I don't think I ever would have started
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are fueling a revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is great news.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you're growing because of my
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an honor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, especially if you are in a
state where it is prohibited.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are breaking the law with my
inspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Power to the people, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we need here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says your words of encouragement were
just what I needed to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a blessing, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to make me cry on camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm exaggerating and being silly,
but I truly do appreciate those words.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I appreciate you taking the time
to provide all of us with this information
[SPEAKER_00]: for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations on breaking 800 episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking forward to many more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, there's no reason to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a good flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a nice setup here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for noticing that the content
is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free freedom, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want everybody, just like you,
I want everybody to grow the best weed
[SPEAKER_00]: that they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them to get inspired that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overgrow the government, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't take down all the grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't stop us all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we all, all the good growers
teach everybody else how to grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's growing good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't go to a party and there's weed
that comes around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go, I'm going to pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want everybody to go, here's my weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to go, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to smoke that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the goal here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has high quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Top shelf weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: No gatekeeping here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's lift everybody up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more to this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I never considered myself a
grower until as of lately this year,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say it took a year to finally get a
true grasp on everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, that's healthy ego, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too many people come in and pop some seeds
and grow a crop of mids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, I'm the best grower on
the block.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you're humble about it,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that you're able to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be a bad ass grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, there's more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says this year I produced some of my
first flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was some sour bubba bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in Georgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, be careful, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know this person.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all a hypothetical.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all made up if anybody's watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in Georgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having my own homegrown just beat
everything I could possibly get my hands
[SPEAKER_00]: on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I'm sure of that, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just that feeling of nurturing your own
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grew it from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to see it from its little,
you got to smoke the weed it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you got to see the little baby all
the way from a little speck all the way up
[SPEAKER_00]: to a bong rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's definitely a very fulfilling
feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it goes on though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I went back and listened to all of
the episodes I could.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've listened to a few of them several
times, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the clicks on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've been listening to you for almost
two years and I'm finally putting in the
[SPEAKER_00]: time to write you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about time, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for showing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says most of the time someone asks what
I need to know before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I've got a few questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't it weird how that works?
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people, when they meet me in
person, they go, bro, it's so weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to send you an email two weeks
ago but then the week I was missed,
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot to send it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You answered my question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I sent it and you didn't even know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's only so much time in the
cannabis grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nine weeks of flower, 10 weeks of
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we got some veg, only so many weeks
to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, I do feel like there's a lot of
synchronicity when it comes to people's
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens and the subjects I choose to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you've got a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the size of a cut matter when you
were trying to make a clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to, I would like a baby cutting
around the size of a pinky pinky finger to
[SPEAKER_00]: do as well as a cutting that is longer
like an index finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever thought of or considered
uploading your videos to your website?
[SPEAKER_00]: More so asking you if you've thought of
uploading your clone video to your
[SPEAKER_00]: website.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple questions in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Size does matter when it comes to cutting
clones because it's all about hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need some hormones in that plant to
keep the plant going.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes it give the urge to make some
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little tiny plant's not going to have
enough life in it, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just more of a struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of a longer stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to leave one node and then the top
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That extra node down there is where a
little bit of the hormones are stored.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will keep that plant vigorous,
healthy, happy, and it will give it more
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to thrive, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pinky finger is kind of short.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going into, if you go into a rapid
rooter, that pinky finger, half of your
[SPEAKER_00]: clone is already buried.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd want more up to get more air,
to get more airflow, to breathe a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go into an easy cloner,
you got to put that bad dog almost all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way submerged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing's showing up up top.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be a little bit wonky.
[SPEAKER_00]: More like an index finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you got more to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably you've got your main leaves up
top here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have a node about here and
about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even right down here, there's a lot
of hormones in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are really going to help the overall
health of your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that is probably something most
people don't think about, but if you leave
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of those little nubbins,
you don't have to leave the whole leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the little shoot on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's hormones in there that will
encourage the production of that clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me find where I was uploading the
videos to my website, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of bandwidth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most importantly, that's fucking
expensive, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually I will find an alternative
upload site other than YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the other places charge money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They limit you on how much you can post.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get it figured out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, I need a producer and
an assistant to get some of that shit done
[SPEAKER_00]: with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me find out where I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you're doing good so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you're over the hump,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, there's more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me keep going because so far it got
weird, but it makes sense now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you flower the clones out all the way
to harvest or do you only put them in
[SPEAKER_00]: flower to determine the sex and then call
the clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to figure out my approach
since it's my first time doing it this
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were going to throw the clones into
flower, their only purpose was to show me
[SPEAKER_00]: the sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they show me flower, I will remove
the corresponding males.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the male plants get away and most of
the time all of those clones will get
[SPEAKER_00]: tossed if their sole purpose was to show
me sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll just toss those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those don't get up potted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those don't get used.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've done their job for what I wanted
them to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do plan on keeping that plant,
it would definitely get up potted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't grow it all the way in just a
little shell or just a little cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would at least put it in a cup,
maybe a one or a three gallon pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: give it some opportunity, depending on how
big you want the plant to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just want to have fun, you can grow
that plant in a beer cup and veg it tilts
[SPEAKER_00]: about three and a half inches tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll flower out about seven to 10 inches
tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be a really cute representation of
what your plant will look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll just be a couple of grams,
but if you do a lot of those, that adds up
[SPEAKER_00]: quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I would transplant those into
bigger pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do plan on keeping them,
if you're just going to use those as sex
[SPEAKER_00]: testing plants, then those clones get
tossed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any any more use for them,
then I would save them, put them into a
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I said that does go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, do you have any kind of extra
notes on the big mountain fudge cake
[SPEAKER_00]: strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been thinking I'm ready to run some
of your beans now that I've got a decent
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of fuckups under my belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, run the big mountain fudge cake
because it is fairly easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're struggling and you've already
got fuckups and now you're confident that
[SPEAKER_00]: big mountain fudge cake is going to bang
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me build a cliffhanger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have tips and tricks and advice for
big mountain fudge cake, but not in this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to watch the episode
coming up in the future all about big
[SPEAKER_00]: mountain fudge cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dude Zach, thank you for the great
question.
