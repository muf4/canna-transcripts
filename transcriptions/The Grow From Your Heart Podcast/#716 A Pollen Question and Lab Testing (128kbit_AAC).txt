[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I don't want to ramble too much
on this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last show I got going pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't answer very many questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get right to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a grow question for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a cannabis culture or cannabis
cultivation question, I would love to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is grow from your heart
at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first message in today's episode came
from our friend Jamie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says in the subject line,
I heard you say THC percentage doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: mean anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to learn why can you point me
to an episode?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is not an episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet, but now there will be an episode to
teach you why I feel odd.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mean the THC percentage doesn't
mean anything, but there's more to this
[SPEAKER_00]: message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I do believe you and I'm not
challenging you in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to understand why you said
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he does talk about some more stuff,
which we don't need to discuss here on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast, just talking about branding and
other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but our friend Jamie asked the
question, um, apparently obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere either on Instagram live on
social media, or perhaps right here on
[SPEAKER_00]: this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did say that THC percentage does not
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it does matter a little bit,
but it is not the deciding factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should not be the deciding factor when
it comes to buying your medical or
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational cannabis products,
whether it's your, uh, your flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: your dabs, uh, whatever you're buying the
THC percentage should not be the number
[SPEAKER_00]: one factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a few notes here and we'll talk
about why, um, the main reason why,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, being immersed in the industry,
being, uh, deeply involved in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, having experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that the tests themselves are very
easily manipulatable, manipulatable,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you can manipulate those tests very
easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can translate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it should have been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I know how to make a lab test come out
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has nothing to do with the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people say they just pay the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: That everybody would just be paying the
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody would have 45% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what everybody would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot pay the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you can do, you can manipulate a lab
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to teach you how to do it
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's very easy to increase the potency
of the samples, which you were sending to
[SPEAKER_00]: the labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're supposed to do it in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's supposed to be a very strict
guideline, um, a standard operating
[SPEAKER_00]: procedure of how the sample should be
taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's nothing forcing you to do
it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, if you're smart, if you're
smooth, uh, if you don't follow all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: rules, you can make the lab tests appear
much better than what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first reason why I don't trust a
lab test is, uh, they're very easily
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulated, easily manipulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that doesn't, that doesn't work well
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I know that I can easily manipulate it
and teach employees how to get better lab
[SPEAKER_00]: tests, then anybody out there can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can all figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's all about prepping the sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take the sample, certain ways,
certain spaces do certain things to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can definitely manipulate that test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also THC is not the only thing that
matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you are smoking, um, I've smoked what
matters is the combination of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, terpenes, and other
compounds that all work together to give
[SPEAKER_00]: you the desired effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go right now to many dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's a dispensary 10 miles that
way, four miles that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're everywhere where I am right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go just a few miles and I can buy
99%, 98% THC, a diamonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just straight up THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're available right next to them for
half the price is green dot batter,
[SPEAKER_00]: a green dot, full spectrum, diamonds,
and sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, plenty of other company stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer the green dot batter because,
uh, I prefer the other stuff in the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't just want the THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: The THC is a small part of it,
but those other things in there really,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I've described it as this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I take, I've, I've hit the THC,
I've hit a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought a big old, they used to sell it
in carrots.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the stuff got popular, there was a
dispensary to sell in big diamonds of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They thought it, we thought it,
we all thought it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm bored with it now because I've
realized that when I take a dab of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter how big it is, I get super high.
[SPEAKER_00]: My, my high goes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how I'm going to describe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it as a firework.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you smoke THC or THCA, that's your
liftoff from your fireworks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course you're going to go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what your THC is going to make you
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more THCA, the more THC, probably the
higher up you're going to go, but you're
[SPEAKER_00]: just going to go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the terpenes, the esters, the
palliates, the flavonoids, all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: other things that are in there are the
things that contribute to the color of
[SPEAKER_00]: your fireworks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way I'm going to put that is
that's what gives you the munchies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what gives you the giggles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what gives you paranoia.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what gives you pain relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what gives you, uh, sometimes when
I dab, I got to poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it makes me hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, lots of different things happen from
different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the same strain will have a lot
of different effects on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think a lot of that is from the
other compounds, not just the THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: The THC is great in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's going to make me go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know I can mess with the lab test to
make it look like there's a lot of THC in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that I need all those other
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've called it the entourage effect,
uh, the synergistic effect, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: the full spectrum effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need all those other components to
actually make the buzz, uh, more
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoyable, more medicated, more medical,
more, uh, for me, it's just more,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a recreational enjoyment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy, uh, so I could, you could give me
all the diamonds and set them right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pure THC crystals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could give me a bunch of green dot
labs batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me some of that GMO batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some of that Picasso or the Dolly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dolly is the one I really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me the Dolly batter, um, or maybe
some of their live rosin even.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to smoke that over the
diamonds 90% of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may take some of the diamonds over here,
the THC crystals and maybe crunch them up
[SPEAKER_00]: and sprinkle, take a dab of the batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just coat it like put sprinkles on the
outside of it with the THC a diamonds,
[SPEAKER_00]: the little crystals, the shiny parts
that's going to make it taste better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to give it a better buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just going to increase the THC a
or the THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying a or a THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't, I didn't write it down,
but I feel like when I smoked that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only get so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start getting the sweats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start to get a headache, but if you put
the other stuff with it, you give it some,
[SPEAKER_00]: some Terps, mainly you give it that
flavor, that other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you get a really nice buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can really achieve something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's almost harsh and too much,
too much THC by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the dabs are, they burn my throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They burn my lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a desirable dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you have to get a hotter than a normal
dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's also a little bit uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on top of that, I kind of burns your
throat on the way in burns the lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it gives me a headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I, uh, I feel like when I come down
from it, it gives me, it's not desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the best way I can describe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be not be like the worst headache,
but I can feel a lingering thing that it
[SPEAKER_00]: was like my body's going, yeah,
where's the other part?
[SPEAKER_00]: You need the other part to make this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so, uh, that's my opinion on the THC a
diamonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that is what I meant when I
said that THC is not the only thing it
[SPEAKER_00]: matters, but it shouldn't be what happens
is, so I said the tests, I can manipulate
[SPEAKER_00]: the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to happen is I run a
commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take the samples or I manipulate the
samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: We send them to the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come back with impressive results.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put that on the jar or on the
advertising at the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: That draws a clientele, the clientele that
just shops for THC percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we know that's going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just marked that one up five more
dollars and eighth or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't work in that department,
but I know that that's how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to the dispensaries and I see the
flowers and I see the shit that's marked
[SPEAKER_00]: like 18% THC and below is one price point.
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 to 22 is another, and then 22 and up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the top shelf stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They charge you more for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of just a, who knows if that
number is even accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're supposed to test a couple of
buds out of the batch, but you might be
[SPEAKER_00]: running a two pound batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be running a 50 pound batch of
the same product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the tests are going to be very
inconsistent among that whole spectrum of
[SPEAKER_00]: all that flower and that big ass bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do love lab testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love a lot of it, but also the labs are
allowed to have a plus or minus 10%
[SPEAKER_00]: threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I say that this flower is 30% THC,
it could be 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be 40.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 10% when, especially when most of our
samples are coming around the 25 to 30%,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do I know they're not 15 to 35 to 40%?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that we should keep in
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to check my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are all machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: The machines love THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high liquid, high pressure liquid
chromatography machine loves to show you
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's got a lot of THC in the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our bodies aren't machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need all of the other components to
make that more desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, this is a joke I love to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Machines never buy another eighth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had a machine come back and
say, bro, that hit really high numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I get another quarter?
[SPEAKER_00]: A machine has never done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a lot of people come back and
say, dude, I smoked that bag so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I get another quarter?
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff that has happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the machines, I like the machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're great.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they called?
[SPEAKER_00]: Markers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was like a marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a like just a marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: A data point is maybe what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not that I'm a body.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a person.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The machines don't care if you like more
THC, more CBD, more limonene, more mercy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The machines don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go lots of THC and that we are not a
machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need all the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me check my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC percentage is a good selling point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good guideline.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something to keep in mind when
shopping, but it should not be the
[SPEAKER_00]: definitive end all be all decision maker
when you are buying your medical or
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get on a side tangent here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's called follow your nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a updated episode on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure follow your nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're buying smell the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that's a good comment right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smell the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also smell the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: When, when you smell things 90% of the
time, when you smell something in your
[SPEAKER_00]: body goes, Oh, that's bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shouldn't consume it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you smell something in your body
goes, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be consuming that oranges smell
good because they're good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poop smells bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you probably shouldn't eat that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody already ate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all their waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nature did that on purpose for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's, that's a blessing and a trait
and a skill that we were given.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, when you drive past the restaurant and
they're cooking, whatever, whatever your
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite restaurant is and you smell it
out there and you go, Oh, I need some of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your body craves it because it's good for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to nourish you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be some fast food or whatever,
whatever, but it's going to satisfy you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been programmed to think that's
good for you, but still your body smells
[SPEAKER_00]: good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good for you that you're supposed
to eat that you smell that pie,
[SPEAKER_00]: bacon, or that cake, bacon, those cookies
being baked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you go, I need to eat a hot cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to burn my mouth with that
cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so fresh out of the oven,
but it's so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to burn myself with a chocolate
chip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the kind of stuff your body does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then somebody farts and you want to
walk away because you go, that's gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stinks, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your body is trained to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you go to buy cannabis,
when you go to buy concentrates,
[SPEAKER_00]: try to give it a smell, smell a few
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take your time at the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to give them your money and
that's what they're there for.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're there to help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not bothering anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing your job at the dispensary,
which is finding the product that is
[SPEAKER_00]: proper for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ever let a bud tender.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on a way big tangent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now don't ever let a bud tender or a
patient behind you, a customer behind you
[SPEAKER_00]: make you feel like you need to be rushed
at the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat it like you're at the bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write all your notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to write, write down the numbers,
cross your eyes, Dr. T's sign your name in
[SPEAKER_00]: the right spot and make sure all the zeros
and decimals are in the right place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get what you need at the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave satisfied.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're spending your hard earned money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Money is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That bud tender is there to do their job,
which is to help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're there on the clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how long you take, they're
getting paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also tip your bud tender.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can afford it, if they help you
out, if they take good care, you tip them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a bud tender friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to say his name because he
knows who he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take good care of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they get drops at my favorite
dispensary, he messages me and he says,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey bro, I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just got this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get a picture of all the new cool
shit that came.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, you know, I'm going to need
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he sends me a picture and he's like,
bro, I already knew what you were going to
[SPEAKER_00]: need.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already stashed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't even worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big up to my friends who take good care
of me like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you tip your bud tenders, they will
take good care of you and stash the good
[SPEAKER_00]: shit for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take good care of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, don't rely on those numbers when you
go to the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think I was getting at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to smell the jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at all the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smells are the shapes, the colors,
the textures of the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something's going to get your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like when you're looking at the menu
at your favorite restaurant or at a new
[SPEAKER_00]: restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at it and you're going,
Oh, they got this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, for me, it's just a bunch of random
vegetarian shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have never heard of, but
vegetarian item one with this vegetarian
[SPEAKER_00]: to spicy vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Savory vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, that's my style right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them will jump out and then you'll,
you'll decide the cannabis will do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go and smell the jars, follow your
nose because your nose knows what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't smell good, you're not going
to want to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't want to smoke it,
how are you going to enjoy it?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it smells, smells delightful,
you're going to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to blow it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to squint your eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to smile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to get a nice buzz from
it because your nose knows just like her
[SPEAKER_00]: old friend, two cans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam used to teach us follow your nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always knows your nose is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Terps are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what your nose is for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow your senses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow your gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long have we been going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not long enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go for another question.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend, Jamie, I hope I've answered
your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, THC numbers are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but also what about the Terps bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to go on a really quick side
tangent Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody sent me a lab report and they
said, bro, there was this much percent
[SPEAKER_00]: Terps in your, uh, in your flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to say there's like 25%
mercine in my flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me translate those terpene reports for
you quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times when you get a terpene
report, they're showing you, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, uh, when it says 25% mercine,
10% limonene, 5% other Terp, I don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to get ahead of myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not saying that the overall sample
you gave them contained 25%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Limonene or mercine.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they are saying in that report is
that there were, was a sample out of all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Terps derived from that sample,
25% of the overall Terps were this
[SPEAKER_00]: component.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember the Terps I named because
I'm ahead of myself again, but so don't
[SPEAKER_00]: get confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they do the sample, they'll say this
much of the overall product was terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be low.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be like one to 4%,
probably like that's, that's good terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: is about like that's run do where that's
impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but of those 4%, now you've got a
hundred percent of your terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: 4% of your overall flower was Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got that now, 25% of that is
where your limonene is going to be your
[SPEAKER_00]: 10% mercine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't get confused and say,
my sample was 25% limonene and 35% THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause then what else do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got like 40%, 35% sludge to carry
that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be chlorophyll and green leafy
amazement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be that amount of water at
that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, read those lab tests correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let me move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a big pile of questions in front of
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this the one that I wanted to read for
this episode?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one will work very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for all the throat clearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not even going to edit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend Adam and it
says, Hey Rosted Jeff, what's up Adam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to meet you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey man, I love the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very entertaining and informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is absolutely the goal here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, also a little bit of education says
nothing better than hearing you ramble,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the episode for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I was going to try to not ramble
fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it says it's the best part of the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe I failed successfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, just a heads up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big fan of growing cannabis comedy
and also fish bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did we just become best friends?
[SPEAKER_00]: We should hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says just wondering if you ever thought
about naming your strains after a fish
[SPEAKER_00]: song or fish lyrics as a fan purchasing a
fish strain would be a must.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have thought about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a, uh, concentrate by green dot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call it Reba jam, which is definitely
named after, of course, Reba.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a fish fan, it's a good Reba
jam, which, uh, bag it, tag it,
[SPEAKER_00]: sell it to the butcher at the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't go wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it also says also, was it possible to
buy or create and store male pollen?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole totally different question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me ramble on about the fish part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a couple of fish strain names in
my head, but nothing has been,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, man, if I'm going to name something
after the band that changed my life that I
[SPEAKER_00]: know if you're just listening and you
don't know, uh, what, what it's like to
[SPEAKER_00]: follow fish around the country and go on
tour and see a bunch of shows,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, that band changed my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a lot being a fish follower,
a fish fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm going to name something after that
band or in honor of that band,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to be something amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I haven't found the right one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, maybe soon because I've got a lot of
great testers out there and some new stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, um, if you've got any ideas,
uh, like Tilo, it would be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, uh, you could say guy UD might be
cool, but if you've got ideas of fish
[SPEAKER_00]: strain names, I would love to hear them
send them to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the email address is grow from
your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know your fish strain name
suggestions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't send me fish and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me the band fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need the, uh, the fucking,
I don't even know fish ref fishing
[SPEAKER_00]: references, uh, but no fly fish or OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No big trout Kush, which, Hey,
somebody out there use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you've got like a, a farmy wildlife
type of vibe, a brand use that bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big trout Kush or fucking big mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG fucking there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wild river Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh wait, there's already a something coal
Creek Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said I wasn't going to ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you I'm fucking fail on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, now to the next part of this one,
is it possible to buy or create and store
[SPEAKER_00]: male pollen?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a medical cannabis grower in
Massachusetts who loves growing the dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm interested in experimenting with seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making, I love how that evolution happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: People get super passionate growing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next thing you know,
they're making seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm not discrediting you or doubting
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love when people do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, then it says a little bit nervous
about keeping a male in the house,
[SPEAKER_00]: just wondering if it's possible to buy or
make and store male pollen for later use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to use my name, say my name,
say my name, big up to our friend Adam and
[SPEAKER_00]: my Instagram, which is you enjoy my dank
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen your Instagram around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for following.
[SPEAKER_00]: And supporting, I read genetics and the
grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk briefly about male pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you can buy male pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, uh, man, I'm not a fan of buying or
selling male pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if you're going to breed
plants, if you're going to breed cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're going to make your own seeds,
you've got to do some of the work buying
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to, it's, it's just,
that's just the cheap, lazy way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't do any selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know that that male is going to
be fired?
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that Solomon is fired because I've
tested him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you bought that pollen, which I
won't sell, um, if you bought that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd know you've got winning pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're just buying pollen from
somebody on the internet or some dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trusting their selection process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's like letting them, that's like
letting them pick your fucking wife or
[SPEAKER_00]: your husband or your mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not down to let somebody else pick
that for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not, uh, I'm not in an arranged
breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in a selective breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I like to choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I choose my male plants, my female plants
based on criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know what that other grower or
breeder or selector, that's all they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't even know about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a selector at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what their goal was.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have their education,
their knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we have no idea what they chose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did they choose that male plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: There may have just been the one that
could have been the one male plant they
[SPEAKER_00]: had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's using pollen, which that's
cool if that's what you're doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but do you really want to make seeds out
of just some male plant or do you want a
[SPEAKER_00]: selected, uh, sought after plant with
traits and alials and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that you're after, or do you just
want, do you want the one I picked or the
[SPEAKER_00]: one that you picked?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we go to the restaurant, you want me
to order dinner for you, or do you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck with the menu and order your dinner?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't like buying pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather hunt out my own males.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really that much work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just do it just like you would
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just find a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you, and then you've got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've got the male, you've got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, storing pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you can run a male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you should have, uh, you're going to
finish a seedless crop, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have a male plant in the veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then right when you finish or right
before you finish that crop, put them in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and let him start flowering out,
uh, collect his pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's only going to take him 14,
21, 25 ish days to start making plenty of
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen for you to start catching it and
playing with it by day 26, 27,
[SPEAKER_00]: 28.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's really busting a lot of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cut him down, gather the pollen
and clean up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can just clean up the room and
get continue back on your normal cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can put yourself behind a couple of
weeks to get a male, or you can have a
[SPEAKER_00]: male in another location in the same grow
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are careful and know what you're
doing, I've got a grow space where I keep
[SPEAKER_00]: my main breeding area inside that breeding
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a three by three grow tent that
ducks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ducting goes out of the tent and
directly out of the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no possibility of that pollen
being reintroduced to the main grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes directly outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of it is ducted inside that room,
but that one tent ducks all the ducting
[SPEAKER_00]: directly outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will never make the pollen back into
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I start pollinating the boy,
he goes in there early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get them ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody else, when it's time for him to
bust a nut, I just open up that tent,
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly drag him out, sprinkle them all
over the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're careful about it,
you can keep a boy in there depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: how much pollen you need, how long you
keep them around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only need him in flower for 10 or no
more than 10, excuse me, for about 14 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 25, maybe 26, 27 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get pollen from him depending on
how many seeds you wanna make,
[SPEAKER_00]: how hard you wanna go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can store it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk briefly about storing pollen
before you store it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So collect it somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how you're gonna collect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say get a Pyrex dish, cut down the
top part of the male plant, set it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Pyrex dish, let it dry, give it a tap.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the pollen will start falling out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull out anything that is not pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got male flowers in there,
leaves in there, buds in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: get all of that shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a desiccant pack in there so it will
dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want a Boveda.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want the pack that sucks up all the
moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry that shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it as dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna say dry about 12 or 30 more
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it as dry as dry can dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any moisture in your pollen will destroy
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will not be active.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the word?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that pollen dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seal it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it in either a glass container,
some of those little glass vials,
[SPEAKER_00]: a glass jar, or you can put it in a
baggie, label it with the male plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: the date which you collected it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then keep it in a cool, dry, dark place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put mine in a brown paper bag in the
crisper drawer in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's simply how I store my pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't open it too often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take it out of the fridge too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about condensation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about temperature changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just leave it in there until you need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then take it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scoop out what you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're safe that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful with pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn off all the fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just want to pollinate one or two
plants in the room, take them out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave the rest in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollinate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple hours later, then put them back
in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray the rest of the bitches in there too
so no pollen gets contaminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water deactivates pollen, so that will
help you out a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water will destroy the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've answered most of these
questions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping a male, yeah, that's a challenge
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure you don't pollinate the
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll fuck it up once or twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all it really takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not just do the work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not get a pack of seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're growing seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're growing plants, anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a dude that really impresses you,
and then you've got a male that nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: else has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you want the male plant everybody
else has got?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's boring to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can store pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can collect it, and you can use it
later in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've answered your question here,
my friend Adam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up and big thank you for the great
question.
