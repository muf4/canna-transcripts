[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, thanks again for the Patreon
support.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have some feedback from the last
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the last episode, I got a question
about labeling a new cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a lot of responses to the terms
and labels I decided to use in that
[SPEAKER_01]: episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will address those here in a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not use the terms P1 for parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turns out I did maybe technically use
the wrong label for the indication that I
[SPEAKER_01]: chose on the new strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we're going to talk about that
very much in depth in a future episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to put that together a little bit
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to focus on this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just wanted to say I do know there was
some controversy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was some great feedback,
which I asked for, and we're going to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about that in depth in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I do need to make an update.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the last episode, I mentioned that we
should check out our friend reclining with
[SPEAKER_01]: Riven and check out his podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people messaged me and said,
Hey bro, Riven has changed the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a new name to Riven's podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is now called Made While Medicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sent me a message and said,
Yo Rasta Jeff, thank you for the shout
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually changed the name of my
channel from reclining with Riven to Made
[SPEAKER_01]: While Medicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sent me a link to the new channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys please do subscribe to my buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's it called?
[SPEAKER_01]: Made While Medicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out that channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Educate yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: More stuff to check out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all hanging out during quarantine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need something to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check out some of my friend's YouTube
channels.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is all of the updates and chatter at
the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's jump into the email portion of this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first question came from the Grow Help
tab on the iRegenetics website.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you check out my website, iregenetics
.com, there is a Grow Help tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you click on there, you are asked a few
preliminary questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ask what strain you're growing,
where you're growing at, what kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: lights, just a few basic questions to give
me an idea of what's going on in your
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm going to answer your questions,
it's very helpful to have some details.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first question comes from the Grow
Help tab and it goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's from our friend they want us to call
them E-dub or Squirrel Master.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go with Squirrel Master.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not have any friends named Squirrel
Master.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to my new friend Squirrel
Master.
[SPEAKER_01]: Squirrel Master is growing Purple Panty
Dropper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not know that was a strain name.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a great name of a strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Panty Dropper is a good name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is being grown indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's under LED lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in week three.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're growing with deep water culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use the Remo Full Line plus Cincyzyme
Hydra Guard and Armor Psy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a very in-depth mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pH of the last feeding was 6.0.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may bring that up just a couple of dots,
but not too extreme.
[SPEAKER_01]: The PPM or EC of the last feeding was
1,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants like that, that's acceptable.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see how that goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Daytime temp says usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nighttime temp says usually hovers around
80, give or take a degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Relative humidity in the day is 55.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have a nighttime humidity
indicated here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: First off, I love the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wish there was more info on
recirculating deep water culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me too, but unfortunately I am not
experienced in recirculating deep water
[SPEAKER_01]: culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know enough about that to deliver
a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be lying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be making shit up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to deliver content that I actually
know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I contradicted that in the past
episode because I said some stuff that was
[SPEAKER_01]: slightly off.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I try to come prepared and talk
about things that I know I'm talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recirculating deep water culture is not my
specialty, my area of expertise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would need to find a friend who is into
recirculating deep water culture that
[SPEAKER_01]: wants to be on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either across the table or via zoom and
get them on the show and have them teach
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Teach me teach you at the same time about
the RDWC recirculating deep water culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I need a friend who knows about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are an expert or consider yourself
an expert and you're comfortable being on
[SPEAKER_01]: a zoom meeting and you want to teach us
about recirculating deep water culture,
[SPEAKER_01]: love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know my email address.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, there is more to this question
that we can address.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I do like to run a 15 hour cycle
for a week before I switch to 1212.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in most cases we run our lights on
either 18 six or something near that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people run a 24 on and zero off cycle
for the vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want a lot of light for the veg stage
keeps them in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we will switch to a 1212 cycle to
induce the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our friend squirrel master here likes to
run a 15 hour on cycle for one week before
[SPEAKER_01]: they switch to 1212.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure why.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people do like to make a gradual
switch from the veg to the flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure why people do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk more about that in a moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it says my question is, do I continue
using my veg feed chart during the 15 hour
[SPEAKER_01]: days?
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do I switch my flower feed chart or do
a combination of both?
[SPEAKER_01]: I use Remos feed charts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks in advance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait until this run is done so I
can grow these orange gasm seeds which
[SPEAKER_01]: have been calling my name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it that you've got some orange gasm
on deck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that you've got a nice practice run
going on before you get to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have you growing like a pro before
you run those orange gasms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always a good idea to stick with that
nutrient calculator.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said that you were growing with Remos
nutrients and you are using Remos nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: feed chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: They made the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know what's in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know what's in each bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know what your goal is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may not need to use 100 percent of
what they recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they say 100 maybe you can use 75.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they say 10 maybe use 7 because of
course they do want you to buy more so
[SPEAKER_01]: they're gonna push you to the very limit
but they're not gonna burn you on purpose
[SPEAKER_01]: so you may be able to reduce just a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's get to the main part of this
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to know if they should use the
veg or the bloom nutrients during these
[SPEAKER_01]: weird 15 hour days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know why there's no 15 hour day chart
in Remos nutrient schedule is because most
[SPEAKER_01]: growers probably would not recommend this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna shit all over your idea of 15
hour days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize but then we're gonna talk
about the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: By going up for a 15 hour day you are
either you're not flowering so you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: inducing the flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not getting enough dark time to go
into flower and you're also losing two
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe three maybe four hours of daytime
photons that your plants could be getting
[SPEAKER_01]: to photosynthesize grow stronger grow
bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're kind of ripping yourself
off by going for that 15 hour day either
[SPEAKER_01]: go veg or go flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go right in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it would be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't get as much benefit from
excessive dark as we do excessive light
[SPEAKER_01]: when we're in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would just go for a longer veg time
during the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate to crap all over your idea if it's
working for you man do your thing but as a
[SPEAKER_01]: very experienced grower with a lot of
knowledge and experience about this plant
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like you're kind of ripping
yourself off and that's why there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: written nutrient schedule for this idea
because we just don't want it most of us
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want to do this most of us wouldn't
do this we would stick with an 18 six veg
[SPEAKER_01]: a 20 on and four off veg a 24 hour veg
something like that then go straight to
[SPEAKER_01]: the 1212.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're kind of ripping yourself
off by doing the 15 hour days but you're
[SPEAKER_01]: technically still in veg and I would feed
them veg because you don't want them to
[SPEAKER_01]: run out of vegetative nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So give them that extra week of veg news.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably two feeds anyway that full
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably maybe two maybe three
feedings anyway so I would stick with the
[SPEAKER_01]: veg newts in that time but unless you've
got a really good convincing testimony as
[SPEAKER_01]: to why you think these hour days because
you're wasting opportunity for photons you
[SPEAKER_01]: could be putting more light hours into
these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The light hours are what make them grow
photosynthesize metabolize.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do feel like you are possibly ripping
yourself off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could get bigger plants faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd be healthier.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that is accurate but
unless you got a really good explanation
[SPEAKER_01]: good testimony I would skip that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like you're ripping yourself off.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right school master.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I have addressed your
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would stick with the vegetative newts.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do insist on doing this method
however I would reassess your reasoning
[SPEAKER_01]: behind this method.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not trying to bash you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not trying to doubt you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying in my opinion that is not
what I would do.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right we're gonna keep moving forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have more messages here in front of
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I go in the right order?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one comes from our Australian
friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they want their names set on the show?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just gonna call this person Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came from our friend Ben in
Australia and this one goes a lot alike of
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says what's up frosted Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Greetings from down under.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to my Australian friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you guys are doing well down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to all the Aussies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to turn upside down here on the
screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't go far enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wouldn't it be cool if I could just make
my dreads hang the other way for a moment
[SPEAKER_01]: and be upside down?
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm rambling and hi today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you are too.
[SPEAKER_01]: The message goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I am loving the Grow From Your
Heart podcast here in beautiful Gold Coast
[SPEAKER_01]: Queensland Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says thank you for all of your grow
advice and for trying to keep things
[SPEAKER_01]: simple for all levels of growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to explain things to where the
brand new growers can learn it but also I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to keep it interesting so the
experienced growers can still follow along
[SPEAKER_01]: and not get bored.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for noticing complimenting
and appreciating my teaching skills.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a small fungus net or something
buzzing around me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry if you see me swatting at that on
camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've said it before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna keep going here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does say I am an outdoor grower of two
years and I am blessed with beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: growing conditions for much of the year
round.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is up for debate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've read this message.
[SPEAKER_01]: That environment is up for debate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I have a question about flowering
which I hope you can help with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got an answer for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says in Australia for growing outside
there's always been a general rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Father's Day to Mother's Day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear that translates from early
September to early April.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got basically the opposite
growing cycle of us here in the States.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says this has always been a reliable
timeframe when growing our Australian
[SPEAKER_01]: regular bag seed which we commonly call
bush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright so you're growing your commonly
found bag seed that you call bush weed
[SPEAKER_01]: there in Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got yourself a pretty figured out
schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like September, October,
November, December, January, February,
[SPEAKER_01]: March, April.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's enough time to grow a good crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like you got that figured out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is where we run into the problems or
the questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says with the advent of commercially
sold seeds and feminized seeds it seemed
[SPEAKER_01]: that we cannot depend on this timeline
anymore as these types of seeds seem more
[SPEAKER_01]: sensitive to our environmental cues and
they do have a tendency to bolt into
[SPEAKER_01]: flower any time for any number of reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: The indica's are especially quick to
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact it seems the only way I can get my
plants through a whole season is to
[SPEAKER_01]: manually pop up the light period in early
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that gives me some hints of what could
be going on right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that they go into flower quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The indica's do it and you can help it by
putting up some light.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gives me ideas already on how to
diagnose your problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says this has a lot of local growers
scratching their osse heads for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my question here is have you heard of
or experienced something like this before?
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I right in thinking these seeds are
more sensitive due to their breeding and
[SPEAKER_01]: feminizing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Quick disclaimer it has nothing to do with
the feminizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has zero to do with feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does have to do with the breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does have to do with the genetics and
the critical photo period of these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has zero to do with feminizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to pin any of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fem seeds get a bad enough wrap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fem seeds have enough fingers pointed at
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We cannot point the finger at fem seeds
for this issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to pull them out and not throw
them under that bus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's pull them out from under that bus
and keep them up on a pedestal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it says is there anything you can
suggest that we could do or we could avoid
[SPEAKER_01]: doing to help our plants stay in veg and
reach their full potential?
[SPEAKER_01]: He signs off with I always appreciate your
time and effort and helping the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ever do come down under to
Australia don't hesitate to hit me up as
[SPEAKER_01]: there will be a nice fat big joint and a
cold drink at the ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care Rasta Jeff from your new osse
friend Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Ben thank you for the invite down
there to Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to come visit you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear that everything out there is trying
to kill you in Australia and now I sound
[SPEAKER_01]: like I got a friend Ben who's gonna keep
me safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go hang out down there and see what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's focus in here and talk about why
these plants are going into flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did reply to Ben so that he didn't have
to wait a long time for me to get this on
[SPEAKER_01]: the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me read what I replied to Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says yo Ben thank you for listening to
the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says all strains have a critical period
that will trigger flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the plants we are working with now
have been bred to flower with 12 hours of
[SPEAKER_01]: uninterrupted darkness because most of the
strains we have bred it works for our
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor grow environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well we have selected they do have a
critical period of 12 hours of under
[SPEAKER_01]: uninterrupted darkness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will make them flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said it sounds like your environment is
giving less than 12 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your osse bred seeds are likely bred from
plants that know the environment there so
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't bloom as eagerly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope this makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since those seeds are from that
environment they know what light cycle to
[SPEAKER_01]: expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: The parent plants for many many
generations have known that these that the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment is going to be short days and
short nights or long nights very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Into the flowering season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these plants have been acclimated
they've been bred to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is is this.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the word I'm looking for it will
come to me I'm just going to keep talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this what's the word when the genes
remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the word it's on the tip of my
tongue I almost said it a minute ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: That word will come to me but it is in the
gene memory.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is part of the evolution of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant has been in that environment for
so long that it just knows it's like hey I
[SPEAKER_01]: know that we're only going to get short
days and I can't start flowering too early
[SPEAKER_01]: or I'm not going to get big enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he did take the time to reply back and
he said thanks very much for taking the
[SPEAKER_01]: time to help out me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is great advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you may have hit the head on the
nail with the light at planting time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get just over 12 hours of daylight
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they're planting their plants at
the beginning of the season they are only
[SPEAKER_01]: getting 12 hours of daylight that will
trigger most newly bred seeds to go into
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got some plants that are from
their environment that know that that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what they're going to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't go into flower as their days
get a little bit shorter.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need that a little bit longer
flowering time and that will put their
[SPEAKER_01]: plants into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it says each day only extends by less
than a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by the time they're mature enough it's
still only twelve and a half hours of it
[SPEAKER_01]: says only twelve point five but it's only
twelve and a half hours of darkness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this is in future grows I will plant
later as well as add manual lighting at
[SPEAKER_01]: the end of the day for a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will solve the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing the seeds that come from
the states or Dutch seeds or maybe Spanish
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds anywhere else those seeds have not
been acclimated climatized.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another word I'm trying to think
of it's like my medics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's in my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys all have to just post the word
somebody's going to type it in the chat
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are yelling it at their phones.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is gene memory.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the word I'm trying to think
of right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway your seeds will if they're from the
Aussie environment they're already
[SPEAKER_01]: programmed I guess to not flower that
early but the seeds that are coming from
[SPEAKER_01]: American breeders Dutch breeders they're
going to keep doing that but putting up a
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: To keep them in veg to give them more
light longer daytime that will solve that
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says it's all learning the podcast
really helps to refine this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep up the excellent work it has been
invaluable knowledge and I for one really
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers from your friend Ben Hey Ben thank
you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the great question and thank
you for letting me solve your problem and
[SPEAKER_01]: thank you for the great feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to wonder what the word I was
thinking was all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to Google that at the
end of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are we.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're about 20 minutes into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got plenty of time for another
message here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one also came from the grow help tab
on the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course I read genetics dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Click on the grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came from our friend who also
supports us on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: This this one came from Black Hippie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Black Hippie is growing the strain GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're growing indoor under LED lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're growing in soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last feed was pH tap water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pH of the feeding was six five.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may go one or two points lower on that
but you can't be too critical sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The EC of the last feeding was two
hundred.
[SPEAKER_01]: The day and night temps were in Celsius
twenty five and twenty three.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to assume that's acceptable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not research Celsius conversions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway let's jump into the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says the Rasta Jeff the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: First off big fist bump bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the show and I never miss an
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am also a proud patriot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the patriot support.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I'm on discord and the IRI and I'm
also an IG IRI army member.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro thank you for all the support all
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: They follow us on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: They follow us on discord and on the
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they watch me on Instagram on Monday on
the live show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a lot of Rasta Jeff support there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I love learning from you and
working on bringing excellence to the
[SPEAKER_01]: green thumb craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it says there's a part here I'm
going to skip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway big respect and Rasta Farai to the
part that I skipped.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says anyway I'm planning on purchasing
some orangegasm seeds soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I decided decided to start practicing
taking clones from a beautifully
[SPEAKER_01]: structured GMO plant that I got the seeds
from a friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: That GMO plant grows beautifully doesn't
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on to say I took eight clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I clipped the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cut it at an angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I then dipped them into clone X and stuck
them into pre soaked root riot cubes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I placed them all inside a misted
propagation dome and sat them on the
[SPEAKER_01]: heating mat inside a closet under 24 hours
of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: After seeing plenty of root growth I
transplanted them into small plastic
[SPEAKER_01]: garden pots using happy frog soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do those pots have drainage holes on the
bottom is my first question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said that garden pots I'm going to
assume so.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I hope so.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I then water lightly and placed
back under the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's where shit starts to go wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says but my family started to look
crispy and they are dying but the stocks
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't actually withering.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought my light might have been the
issue because I've heard that clones don't
[SPEAKER_01]: need direct light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I put them under a small led for
vegging.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be your issue if the light was
too much it may have crisp them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think we've got bigger issues here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably better off under that led.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep that led up kind of high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get it too close.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just want to give them enough light to
adjust to their new environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't want to just throw these away
as an experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know what else to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I even fed them some microbes and Cal Mag
Cal Max probably not a good idea for these
[SPEAKER_01]: little tiny plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Microbes is probably a great idea but
don't give them Cal Mag next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably freaking them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if I get any improvements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much as of yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if they're still focusing
on even building a root system but I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing any new growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to get this down right before I
get some orangegasm so that I don't lose
[SPEAKER_01]: those genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says again thank you for all the love
and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm about to take a fat dab and since it's
2 a.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: here on the Red River I'll give my mom a
hug tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to mama.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope she got her hug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope mama's doing well here during COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it says PS I tried uploading a
picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah it's difficult uploading a picture
here on the new Grow Help tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will work on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the web guy if you're
watching this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe bill me for that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I will post on Cannibuzz though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget to follow us all on
Cannibuzz.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says you can check that out if you'd
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am at blackhippie420 on Cannibuzz.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have some feedback for you here.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first question is when you took these
clones it sounds like you took them
[SPEAKER_01]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cut them at an angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stuck them in the clone X juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got them in the rapid router or the
root riot cubes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You waited till you had some roots then
you transplanted them.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is did you slowly acclimate
these plants to the new environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were in a dome for a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you open up the domes and then take
off the dome for a little bit every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or did you just take these plants out of
the clone dome and pop them right into
[SPEAKER_01]: cups and throw them under grow lights and
hope they would survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been growing in that dome and kind
of a protected environment for however
[SPEAKER_01]: long it took them to get roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what needed to be done I don't know if
you did this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just giving this advice for anybody
who is trying to transfer their clones
[SPEAKER_01]: from their clone dome to the regular
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you take clones you can't just pull
them out of that clone dome.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's humid.
[SPEAKER_01]: They love that environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're used to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to slowly acclimate them to the
outer environment unless you're unless
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got a room with the same exact
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's inside that clone dome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to slowly adjust them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way I recommend to do it is about a
week after you've cut them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to want to before you get to
this point you're going to want to open
[SPEAKER_01]: them up and re-moisten those plugs then
close them back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then about day seven start opening the
vents.
[SPEAKER_01]: My clone domes have two vents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some only have one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start opening the vents just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe 10 maybe 20 percent of the vent will
be open on day one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let that kick it for a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let those plants get used to having a
little bit of airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then move it just a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it go for a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then move it just a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: After those plants are starting to develop
a few roots that's when I start taking the
[SPEAKER_01]: dome off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take it off for about 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it sit for 15 minutes and put it back
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then tomorrow take it off for 15 more
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do that for about three days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then step up to 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do that for about three days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then step up to 45 maybe an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do that for three maybe five days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then go two hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then go four hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once those plants can go four maybe six
maybe eight hours out of that dome without
[SPEAKER_01]: showing any signs of being angry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when I will transplant them into
their cups or their small pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you've got to give them a small
adjustment period.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just throw them from that dome
directly into that new environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when they will see issues very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is the first thing I would
recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slowly acclimate these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go straight from the clone dome
right on down into that environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to go from the shower to
outside in the snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be a shitty transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to go from the shower to the
hot bathroom to the warmer living room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you step outside once you're dressed
and you can face the cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to do the same thing to the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said they started shriveling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me my voice is getting dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said they started shriveling.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're starting to lose moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're starting to dry up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're starting to possibly die between
the outside environment and that light on
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're cooking a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have taken them out too quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe wait until you have got more roots
next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower I'd like to see you
wait until you've got ridiculous excessive
[SPEAKER_01]: roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of time we get very impatient.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to just pot right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wait until you've got a lot of roots
and then be very careful transplanting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You very well could have crushed the
roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have that your new soil could be
packed too loosely could be packed too
[SPEAKER_01]: densely.
[SPEAKER_01]: There could be a few things causing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it sounds to me honestly like you went
too quickly from being in that domed
[SPEAKER_01]: environment into the non domed
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is what it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would practice again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cloning materials are not the most
expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: This could be the not the most expensive
mistake you could have made and everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: needs practice learning how to clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just cut those clones the same way you
did before you did everything fine right
[SPEAKER_01]: up to the transplant point it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also don't give those clones the Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't need that yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can wait till they're a little bit
bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also maybe bring the pH of your feeding
down closer to six three six four at six
[SPEAKER_01]: five maybe just a bit high for the clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: But honestly I do think that what you
probably did was introduce them to that
[SPEAKER_01]: outer environment just a little bit too
quickly slow that down a little bit next
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I bet they will be a little bit
happier with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know how that works for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know if you've got any more
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to see if we can help you out
and guide you through getting your clone
[SPEAKER_01]: game on point.

girls pimps and hoes friends and foes
