[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need is right
there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I do include a link in the
show notes and in the video description to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it nice and easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all of my friends, I do want to start
the show by saying, wow, I apologize for
[SPEAKER_00]: going through that intro super fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked a strain of some flowers of a
strain called Jack Tripper, and it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: me going super fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully I can calm down and get this
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my brain is speeding through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Tripper is a cross of it is lemon
skunk and Jack the ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a flavor of lemon candy and
spiciness and some dryer sheets in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite part is that it has just got
my brain says to suspend and I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: super fast in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also something I noticed most of the time,
when I smoke flowers, my mouth gets super
[SPEAKER_00]: dry, my mouth, my throat, my nose,
my eyes, I get that dry cotton mouth
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling that just crusty I feel in from
smoking so much flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not have that feeling at all from
these flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is quite the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mouth feels not to it sounds kind of
gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got juicy mouth from smoking those
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tasted so good that my mouth is like
watering thinking about the lemon candy
[SPEAKER_00]: flowery spicy flavors that came from it's
like lemon candy bubblegum dryer sheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stuff lingering on my
tongue right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to keep myself together
and do a good podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But heads up, I was smoking some good shit
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to ramble too much because
that is definitely a possibility in this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did say at the beginning of the show
that we were going to talk about pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: drift in our outdoor gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are wrapping up the outdoor season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most folks in the United States have
wrapped up their outdoor grow season if
[SPEAKER_00]: you have not wrapped up, you are a savage
or a maniac.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: But many people have wrapped up their
outdoor grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have gotten their outdoor
grows tested by a lab facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're testing for potency and we're
posting testing for terpene content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we're testing for contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're testing for heavy metals and the
presence of pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're making some weird discoveries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was having this conversation with some
friends in a discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just after that, we had some
flowers, not any of my flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a friend, another person that I
associate with an outdoor grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was checking out a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They discovered that some of their flowers
are testing hot for pesticide exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how is this happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the people I'm talking about never
used any spray applications in their
[SPEAKER_00]: garden, especially the products that they
are being tested positive for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're saying, how did this happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only one solution that I could
come up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody, a neighboring garden must have
been applying illegal pesticides or
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides that were drifting into our
friend's garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: To think about, are you applying a
pesticide?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this only works for an outdoor garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're applying indoors, that shit's
stuck indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about where you're exhausting too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, you're just
spraying indoors, outdoors, no matter how
[SPEAKER_00]: big your garden, if you're using a three
by three plot of land that is yours and
[SPEAKER_00]: the neighbors are sharing that land on the
other side of that imaginary fence,
[SPEAKER_00]: that imaginary borderline, it is still
your responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got acres and acres,
it is still your responsibility to control
[SPEAKER_00]: the products that you apply to your
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they drift and travel outward,
it is our responsibility to be responsible
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide applicators.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been trained by the Department
of Ag, if you've taken any training
[SPEAKER_00]: classes, if you're certified, you probably
understand the importance of pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people may not understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were talking about it and there were
a lot of things that came to my mind and I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought we could do a good podcast about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So did your neighbor contaminate your
grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you contaminate your neighbors grow
were the first two questions that I wrote
[SPEAKER_00]: in my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pesticide can drift when you are spraying
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is windy, it can travel to the grow
next door.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can travel every direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could travel whichever direction the
wind is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's be careful when we're applying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this doesn't only count in cannabis
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have neighbors that are using,
you may have a fruit and vegetable crop
[SPEAKER_00]: next door.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have a hemp crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have, they may have a pumpkin
patch coming up right next door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about what they're spraying,
what they're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about what you're spraying and what
you were using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to have detrimental effects on
either side of the fence?
[SPEAKER_00]: Possibly four sides of the fence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you got people all around you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means you got at least four people to
think about other than yourself when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to pesticide applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be good neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be a good community.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're growing cannabis and a lot of people
already have a little bit of a stigma for
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people were programmed and
trained that reefer madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is the devil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to smoke, smoke a little bit
of weed and start raping ladies and
[SPEAKER_00]: committing crimes and doing all the worst
shit you could think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to become the devil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't happen that way, but they think
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's try to be good neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're growing cannabis right next door to
people that may be afraid of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be good neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not destroy their crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that is one more thing to make them
hate team cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try to be their friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more about that a little bit
here in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you spraying your neighbors?
[SPEAKER_00]: And another thing to think about are your
neighbors spraying or treating and sending
[SPEAKER_00]: their pests your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you spray for a pest or treat for a
pest or a problem, especially like if you
[SPEAKER_00]: got spider mites or something like that,
I'm just going to pick spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you spray for spider mites outdoors,
they're going that way and that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if your neighbors didn't spray for
spider mites, they're going to get spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't treat for spider mites in
some sort of way, maybe you sprayed,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you got predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you got some sort of electromagnetic
will mind control that you can use to
[SPEAKER_00]: control spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: When one of you treats for bugs,
the bugs are going to go to the other
[SPEAKER_00]: yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just going to say, Oh,
this guy sprayed for spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just climb the fence.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no fence or spider mites or
microscopic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just going to travel south.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to go to the next garden
right over there because that person
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't treat for bugs, didn't treat for
spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if one of you is treating and one of
you isn't, they're just going to move
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you're treatment wears off
or your spray wears off, they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: go to the other garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the other guy is going to spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to keep traveling around.
[SPEAKER_00]: A great way to prevent this would be
farmer unity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not go and meet your neighbors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not go and talk to each person around
you growing and see how you are handling
[SPEAKER_00]: pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that in a lot of agricultural
areas, there are meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have town meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: People get together in small towns.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like to gather and meet maybe at
church, maybe somewhere like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say, Hey, are you guys treating?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing stopping you from going
and knocking on the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know maybe there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, farmers are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a lot of farm life
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a city boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an indoor grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually contacted a farmer friend and I
said, Hey, is there a protocol for this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess the thing would to do would be
to go knock on their door or send them a
[SPEAKER_00]: letter or contact them some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people, they're facing the same
challenges as you possibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you went over there and said,
Hey, last year I got hit with spider mites
[SPEAKER_00]: real bad around this time of year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you notice that as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to go, well,
holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So did I.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to go, well, this year,
I'm going to do this to treat the spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can say, well, that was your
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe they'll say, you know,
my grandpappy taught me that for 20 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: we did this and it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might learn some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might teach some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be afraid to make contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go over there, establish some friendships,
build a relationship, see what you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: are doing and work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, like I said, you could just be
passing those problems from farm to farm
[SPEAKER_00]: to farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got, think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got four farms meeting at a
corner, you got the four corners.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to go from plot A to plot B
to plot C to plot D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in a circle, just going to rotate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys don't do something,
if you guys all team up, you'll kill all
[SPEAKER_00]: the pests, all the problems work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can all have successful outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if one guy's growing corn and one
guy's growing soybeans and one guy's
[SPEAKER_00]: growing something else and you're growing
weed, you're going to have free coin,
[SPEAKER_00]: free corn, free soybeans, free tomatoes
all year, because you guys teamed up and
[SPEAKER_00]: helped each other out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he got some new smoke and buddies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things should work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unity is the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know when it does come to
treating outdoors for our pests and
[SPEAKER_00]: preventing for pests, my favorite and most
recommended method would be the.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use of predator insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally am not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not experienced and well versed in
outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a little bit of greenhouse
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done some help in outdoor farms,
but I've never been in charge of an
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor grow to the best of my knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: From what I've seen, I think that predator
bugs would be the most useful avenue and
[SPEAKER_00]: mode of attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally, maybe I'm a big old hippie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to go spray a bunch of stuff
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only am I going to spray the plants
I'm intending to spray, but also possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: I may over spray and spray the crop next
door and that will result in my friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: my neighbors having a pesticide exposure
they were not looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're growing, if I'm growing one
product and they're growing another and I
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayed over here, maybe the product I'm
spraying is not allowed to be sprayed on
[SPEAKER_00]: their product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the product they're spraying isn't
allowed on my product and now we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to contaminate each other's product and it
has to be destroyed and we lose our
[SPEAKER_00]: product for the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my favorite option would be the
predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when you spray stuff, what else are
you destroying?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not just hitting your plants,
you're hitting the soil, you're hitting
[SPEAKER_00]: everything around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if any wildlife passes through,
you're getting that wildlife also,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we may want to keep the wildlife
away, but you should have built a fence or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to get animals, bunnies,
shit like that sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the bunnies and the
chickens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's learn to use those sort of things to
our advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chickens are around eating all the
small jumping critters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the bunnies do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I'm not a farm guy,
but let's learn to use our natural
[SPEAKER_00]: buddies, the chickens and things like that
to our advantage to help take care of that
[SPEAKER_00]: grill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe let some chickens out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one of your farmer friends already
has a bunch of chickens next door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe bring them chickens through your
crop to eat all those grasshoppers that
[SPEAKER_00]: are trying to take over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm saying, if we use our resources
and team up together, we could definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: make things better.
[SPEAKER_00]: This applies side rant hippie talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you I'm high.
[SPEAKER_00]: This applies to just about everything in
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we talk to the people around us and
say, what's your goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we trying to do instead of just
doing it all on our own and trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking do everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the person next to us has a goal
that lines up with ours and we can help
[SPEAKER_00]: each other out and we can all get there
together and not leave people behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not fucking fail because we didn't ask for
help.
[SPEAKER_00]: This works with everything in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Team up with the people around you.
[SPEAKER_00]: See who's got similar goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: See who has similar things in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's work together and get each other
where we want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way nobody struggles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all a community.
[SPEAKER_00]: The community can be a community again.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the isolation, all the quarantine
that's coming to an end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be community again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get together, try to love one
another and feel all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm telling you that Jack
Tripper is some good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let me segue into, I wrote down,
protect the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like hippie shit, but it is all
of our responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: That land is yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that portion of land is your land.
[SPEAKER_00]: This land is my land.
[SPEAKER_00]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: For now, in the future, you're going to
die.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to have to live on that
land after us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a child.
[SPEAKER_00]: She hopefully one day, not too far,
not too fucking soon, settle down kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully she has children one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully those children have children.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need safe, healthy, viable land for all
of our children.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's our responsibility now to make
sure that that land is healthy when our
[SPEAKER_00]: children's children are there to play in
that dirt, to grow their food,
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow their ganja in that dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also protect the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's just a side rant,
but protect the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing a cannabis,
it is your responsibility to protect the
[SPEAKER_00]: land and the water around your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said about the land, that's not
ours forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That water is moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: That water is yours and that section,
but it's traveling downstream and taking
[SPEAKER_00]: all the destruction, the contamination,
the pollution, the bad vibes that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's traveling downstream quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing that shit to the people downstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be a good person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love the water, love the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will love you back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe that it will take care of you
if you love it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this does work us into a little bit of
a recap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Previously, I've done an episode about bud
washing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody asked me, will bud washing help
with the pit of the pesticide situation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Possibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that depends on what pesticide was
applied to the flower and what stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: how strong there are a lot of contributing
factors here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, was it just a surface application is
what I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you applied some sort of oil,
some hippie oil that just landed on the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface of the leaf and made that plant
undesirable for attacking pests or maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you applied something systemic,
they got inside of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no washing that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: A product like fluoromite or avid that's
inside of your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't wash that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's moving around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the cellular part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no getting rid of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That bud is going to test positive for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever the main ingredient is that is it
will test positive for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what you do, even with a bud
wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bud washing will take off your powdery
mildew, your bug poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may take off some of your lighter,
uh, surface sprayed type products,
[SPEAKER_00]: but your systemic stuff is inside of that
plant and you cannot get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bud washing may help with some things,
but it's not going to get rid of every
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide that you used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one more thing to talk about when it
comes to protecting our outdoor grows and
[SPEAKER_00]: taking care of our neighbors is pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of people growing outdoors in
the city and in the country on farmland in
[SPEAKER_00]: urban areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very careful with your male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a male plant outside and it
starts to drop pollen, the wind will take
[SPEAKER_00]: that pollen for miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can go a long way depending on what's
in the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in the city, if you've got a big
city, I've got buildings and houses and
[SPEAKER_00]: trees and shit here that may block some of
that pollen from getting places.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're in a flat landed area with
not a lot of shit, that pollen is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: travel and it could go quite a ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could go very far.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there are stories of pollen
traveling miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how true or real that is,
but there are legends and stories of
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen moving for miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can go a ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can go quite a distance, at least a
quarter mile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing outdoors, pay very close
attention to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for males, get rid of those males
very early.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to do any breeding
outdoors, be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really consider how far that pollen will
travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have neighbors that are growing
hemp or cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: You may mess up their entire crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if they're out there growing hemp or
cannabis and they miss their meals,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to mess up your crop too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn how to identify males.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is best practice in my opinion,
to put tested plants outdoors so we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: put boys out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand a lot of people are just
plopping thousands of seeds and hoping to
[SPEAKER_00]: find the boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very careful with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very diligent with your male search.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, please don't ruin other people's
