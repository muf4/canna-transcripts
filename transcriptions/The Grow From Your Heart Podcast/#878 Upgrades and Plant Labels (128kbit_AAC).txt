[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode 878 of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've got another fun episode
lined up for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: In today's show, I'm going to give away
free seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang out, we'll talk more about those free
seeds a little bit later on in the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get too far, I do want to wish
everybody a happy 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, this episode will come out
on 419.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope everybody has a safe and stony 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would not be 420 without a 420 sale at
iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, make sure you check
iredirect.com for new testers,
[SPEAKER_01]: restocks, sale pricing, and free shipping

there is Double Dragon to Blueberry,
[SPEAKER_01]: and there may still be a few packs of
Cherry Skunk to Blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, because the sale has begun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, there is a sale at acinfinity.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, most of my Grove is equipped
with acinfinity.com equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the end of the year, everything will be
acinfinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am slowly upgrading.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend acinfinity gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check acinfinity.com because
they are doing a 420 sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sale is live now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does end Sunday.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sale goes April 18 through April 21.
[SPEAKER_01]: acinfinity is going to give you 10% off
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the store, I am also going to give you
a coupon code for an additional 10% off.
[SPEAKER_01]: That coupon code is iryarmy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use coupon code iryarmy to save an
additional 10% for a total of a 20%
[SPEAKER_01]: discount at acinfinity.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I think that covers all of the
news here at the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's work our way into the question and
answer portion of today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the start of the show, I said that I
was going to give away free seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how you win free seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a website.
[SPEAKER_01]: That website is irygenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the top of that website, there is a row
of tabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those tabs does say grow help or
grow questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you click on that tab, you are given
the opportunity to send me a grow
[SPEAKER_01]: question.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you send a good grow question and I
read that question here on the podcast,
[SPEAKER_01]: I will send you a coupon code for a free
pack of seeds at irydirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's first question came from the grow
help tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came from my new friend who wants to be
called H.D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to my buddy H.D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ben, make sure you check your inbox and
check your spam because you have got a
[SPEAKER_01]: coupon code for a free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ben's question goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, yo, this is Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a great question from a new
grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I like this question a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I have a tent, a light,
a clip-on fan, controller 69, and an
[SPEAKER_01]: exhaust fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need a humidifier and a tent heater and
a few other small details.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you buy and in what order would
you buy them for a new grower?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wraps it up with, I appreciate the help
and I appreciate what you are doing for
[SPEAKER_01]: the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yo, I'm thankful that you noticed what I'm
doing for the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm grateful for the great message and I'm
glad that you trust me to guide you
[SPEAKER_01]: through this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you've got a great setup here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, most of what I'm going to
recommend is going to be from AC Infinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot be at AC Infinity when it comes
to home grow equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, a lot of this stuff is going to be
blatantly, I'm going to recommend AC
[SPEAKER_01]: Infinity gear, acinfinity.com,
coupon code IRYARMY.
[SPEAKER_01]: That code is good on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: That code is good on Etsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That code is good on the AC Infinity
store.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll get you 10% off all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you shop during the sale, you will save
20%.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say that a lot of times in
this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the things that I recommend you should
buy, you've got a tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got the main enclosure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great thing to start with.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a good light?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would put a good light in there,
the best light that you can, the best
[SPEAKER_01]: light you can afford, the best light you
can power and the best light you can cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are three things to think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you afford the light?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the most biggest obstacle there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you afford to run the light?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have enough electricity in the
house?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a breaker available for that
light?
[SPEAKER_01]: And can you cool it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that light is going to create heat
in your environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to cool that light, that
environment some way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get the best light that you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said you have exhaust, so you're
probably exhausting that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you say that you have a filter?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see the word filter in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would recommend a carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since you've got the exhaust, you probably
have a carbon filter on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would recommend that just for a
little peace of mind, a little safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a controller 69.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like you've got a tent package.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're off to a really good start.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do indicate that you do need a
humidifier and a fan heater or a tent
[SPEAKER_01]: heater, which depending on where you live,
I never need some things I don't need.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need a dehumidifier because I live
in a dry space.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be the humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to keep the humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So depending on where you are,
you will need certain things and won't
[SPEAKER_01]: need some things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, I can make some recommendations
to kind of upgrade your grow experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the tent, the light,
the exhaust, the filter, the fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the AC controller.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe think about upgrading to that AI
controller might be something else you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to upgrade to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But something I would recommend,
and this is not anything that I am
[SPEAKER_01]: sponsored by, but I like cameras in my
grow environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the ACI controller 69.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can look on your phone and you can see
the temperature, the VPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can read a lot of things based on what
gear you've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a camera in there,
you can see the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like being able to look at the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm away and I'm like, man,
I kind of I'm having fun at this gathering
[SPEAKER_01]: or playing music with friends or at a drum
circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that the lights came on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of want to check on the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't want to stop what I'm doing,
drive all the way home to go check on
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can just open up the controller or open
up the app on my cameras and I can open up
[SPEAKER_01]: the controller 69 and see the VPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I can open up the app and I can
look at the plants and see that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: actually OK with my Wyze cameras.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use just basic Wyze cameras for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a very good deal on Wyze cameras on
Black Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought a three pack bundle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to buy a lot more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are great cameras.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cameras in the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They give me a lot of peace of mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go very well with the AC Infinity
controller 69.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see the temperature, the humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see a lot of things and I can
actually look at the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you open up my phone on the front page
on the bottom, those two apps are right
[SPEAKER_01]: there because I open them up a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cameras are something I would check
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then something just to make the day better
in the grow, a Bluetooth speaker or some
[SPEAKER_01]: AirPods.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always got some music, a podcast or
the Discord crew in my ear, keeping me
[SPEAKER_01]: entertained.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing I can recommend and these
next two things, three or four things are
[SPEAKER_01]: very small items that are available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through AC Infinity dot com that you might
not even have thought about, but they will
[SPEAKER_01]: make your grow experience a little bit
better, more enjoyable and easier and more
[SPEAKER_01]: successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: AC Infinity sells a sprayer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a pesticide sprayer or a foliar feed
sprayer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It plugs into a USB and you can charge it
up and then you press the button and it
[SPEAKER_01]: sprays for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not realize how obnoxious it was
pumping a sprayer all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: This bad dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: You plug it in and you plug it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You charge it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can unplug it and it's portable
and that bad dog fucking sprays for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It saves your wrist.
[SPEAKER_01]: It saves whatever muscle you were using.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to do that now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit nicer and you get the
consistent spray all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pumped it 40 times.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good for a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to pump it 40 more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stays even all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So AC Infinity sells a pesticide sprayer
or any powered sprayer that you can find.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do recommend that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are we now?
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a leaf surface VPD gun available
from a AC Infinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I highly recommend that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are running LED lights,
the temperature of the air in the room and
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaf surface temperature could be
drastically different.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my room, it varies as much as five to
nine degrees depending on the day,
[SPEAKER_01]: the heat, the time of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the only way to find that out is to
get a leaf surface temperature gun that
[SPEAKER_01]: measures VPD of the leaf surface
temperature as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put that data into your ACI
controller 69 and that will help you
[SPEAKER_01]: offset your leaf surface temperature and
give you more accurate readings on what's
[SPEAKER_01]: going on in your room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that little VPD gun is very useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only will it tell you the temperature
and the leaf and the VPD of your leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: surface temperature, but it helps you dial
in the room a little bit better by putting
[SPEAKER_01]: that data into the controller 69.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing you can add on would be a pH
meter and an EC meter or a PPM meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all in one meter if you get it
through ACInfinity.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got that one combo meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to adjust your EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to check your pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not use the ACI meter to go with
everything else we've got?
[SPEAKER_01]: A heater, an air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you need those devices?
[SPEAKER_01]: I use a little rolling Solius 14,000 BTU
air conditioner and it ducks out of a
[SPEAKER_01]: window.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, I can't use a window unit
where my grow is because it's in a
[SPEAKER_01]: basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a window that would work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I use the Solius rolling air
conditioner.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 14,000 BTUs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't cool just the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cool the entire room in which the tents
are in and then duck that cool air into
[SPEAKER_01]: the tent as needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm using a lung room essentially to
control the climate and the lung room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the way I'm doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humidifier and dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't necessarily need either one of
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is quite dry here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't get a lot of humidity problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way that my room is set up,
like I said, I've got the tents in another
[SPEAKER_01]: room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the humidity gets ducted out of the
tent into the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when the room reaches a certain
humidity, that actually has another
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction that blows the heat and
humidity out of that room to bring in
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't need the dehumidifier or
humidifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just use the lung room to kind of make
that work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use the moisture of the plants for my
humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those are things that you just might
need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, those devices, the air conditioner,
the humidifier and dehumidifier,
[SPEAKER_01]: those are going to be high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Electricity items.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure that you're running enough
electrical for those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you have enough breakers and
amperage available for those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I covered a lot of the gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cameras.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to see the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sprayers, because I want to spray my shit
once a week, maybe twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: VPD gun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get that VPD dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: ECPH and PPM meter so I can get the feed
dialed in properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heater, air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the environment dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be so fucking careful with the heater.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow room heaters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always any kind of heater.
[SPEAKER_01]: Space heater, portable heater.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a step away from fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: That always makes me fucking nervous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be careful with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humidifier, dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: You understand what to do with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I set a grow room speaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got a JBL speaker, some AirPods,
something like that, that will always make
[SPEAKER_01]: the grow more enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can get some sort of dedicated
music player for the grow, if you can just
[SPEAKER_01]: leave some music on all the time,
I really think that the plants enjoy
[SPEAKER_01]: music.
[SPEAKER_01]: They enjoy probably what you enjoy,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think plants feel the vibration of
the music.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like music.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me feel a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if I don't like the music,
it makes me feel a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that still counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think music in the grow is a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: A real simple thing you can pick up.
[SPEAKER_01]: A broom and a dustpan and a mop and a
bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean grow room will make you proud.
[SPEAKER_01]: A clean grow room will make you feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll want to be in there more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organize that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get some shelves in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean that and organize it real nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a trash can.
[SPEAKER_01]: A trash can with a lid on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The kind that you could step on it and the
lid pops up and you let go and it closes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the kind of can that I would
prefer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then some other things we could jump into
just to kind of bougie up the grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good measuring devices.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you measuring your nutrients?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you fucking struggling or do you have
it figured out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Research what works best for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you just want to pour it into a
measuring cup?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you the guy that uses the fucking
syringe type thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: What works the best for you is your
watering setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way that you want it to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you pouring into a five gallon bucket
then using a pitcher?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you auto watering?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now's the time to think about how to make
the watering environment, the watering
[SPEAKER_01]: situation, the best you can for your
needs, your environment, your time,
[SPEAKER_01]: your capabilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big dude and getting to the back
right corner of a grow tent can be a pain
[SPEAKER_01]: in the ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: That left corner I can unzip the side on
the ACI.
[SPEAKER_01]: The right one it's against the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't fucking get back there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's hard to get to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you need to build an auto watering
system?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there something you can improve?
[SPEAKER_01]: With that, that is something to think
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about proper nutrient and pesticide
storage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have these products in a safe
storage area where maybe kids can't get to
[SPEAKER_01]: it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your pets can't get to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to get spilled.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to get too hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not going to get too cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bottles are not exposed to sunlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something people overlook.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nutrient and pesticide storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have some more safe to store that
stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: How about good personal protective
equipment?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know this is just details at this point,
but get yourself a couple of Tyvek suits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a couple of good masks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get some good goggles.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're working with pesticides and
nutrients, you might want some good
[SPEAKER_01]: goggles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of hair situation do you have?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get some shit to tie up your dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Customize that situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you got all the personal protective
equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Buy boxes and boxes of rubber gloves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need the shit out of
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then what about nutrients and pesticides?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have all the quality nutrients and
pesticides that you need?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a good base nutrient?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a good bloom booster?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a good Cal Mag?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a good potassium silicate?
[SPEAKER_01]: What about maybe some amino acids?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you using for microbes?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you using for a terp enhancer?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your nutrient mix?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that dialed in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about that because that's your fuel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your light and your nutrients are a big
part of how your plants fuel themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's think about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a good pesticide rotation?
[SPEAKER_01]: What about maybe a dry erase board or a
notebook to write down your nutrient mix
[SPEAKER_01]: and your pesticide rotation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe just use an app in your phone,
but write this shit down somewhere also.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a decent pesticide rotation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have two or three, three or four
pesticides that are based on different
[SPEAKER_01]: base products, which I'm saying what I'm
trying to say is different modes of
[SPEAKER_01]: attack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have something that is a pyrethrin
base and has a diractin based and then
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly like a bacillus based product and
then whatever else you want to mix into
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got three or four different products
I mix through.
[SPEAKER_01]: I rotate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spray once a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means four products will last me most
of the time last one month long and then I
[SPEAKER_01]: can just start the rotation over.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is evergreen, azimax, botanigard,
and venerate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the that's the process right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Azimax, evergreen, venerate, and
botanigard max.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the four that are generally in
my rotation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll switch some shit in and out once in a
while, but step up your pesticide game if
[SPEAKER_01]: you have not done that already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, upgrade every room slowly as you
learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're in the room, what do you see?
[SPEAKER_01]: What could you make?
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, you know what equipment
you don't like.
[SPEAKER_01]: What sucks?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fix that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slowly improve that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then what do you want to make better?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like building a car.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like building a drum set.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like building a fucking AR-15.
[SPEAKER_01]: It never comes out of the box the way you
want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to put accessories and shit on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The grow room is that way as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you want to customize?
[SPEAKER_01]: What does your light suck?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does your blower suck?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's AC infinity, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's not AC, what needs to be
upgraded?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Upgrade each room slowly as you learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I put a big star here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says do not overlook the importance of
your veg and mother areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody focuses on the flower room.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want that fucking rock star flower
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best lights, the best blower.
[SPEAKER_01]: All your shit's in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your meters are in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know exactly what's going on at Auto
Waters at nine o'clock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is fucking perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But your veg room looks like a trailer
park exploded and you took all the
[SPEAKER_01]: leftover parts and made a grow room out of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's focus a little bit on that grow,
on the veg and the mom environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the mom is where the clones come
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have healthy mother plants or
clone donors, what are you starting with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you need a healthy mom plant or a clone
donor or somewhere to get those clones?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we need a healthy veg environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where we're starting everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the building blocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is step one.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you fuck up from day one, by the time
you get to day 120, you're gonna be really
[SPEAKER_01]: fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you set yourself up for success by
having a healthy mom environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: a perfect cloning environment,
a beautiful small veg environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: a really tight large veg environment,
and then transition smoothly into a really
[SPEAKER_01]: souped up flower room everything will be
real nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't forget to upgrade that veg area,
the mom area, the clone area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those plants are just as important,
if not more important, than the flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: area.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the fucking children.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's going to be your next adult
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So love that room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now once you've got everything all souped
up and all perfect, what else are we gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: buy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have good scissors?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a way to clean those scissors?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a trim bin?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm jumping ahead of myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about a clone machine?
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer the easy cloners.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those work the best for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: For what I'm trying to do, do you have an
easy cloner?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's something you want to try.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll make your clones much more robust
if that works for the way you're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do that research there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said a veg area.
[SPEAKER_01]: How is your veg area set up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a good blight?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have plenty of fans in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have your auto watering system in
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a tray on the floor in the veg
area like you do in the flower area or are
[SPEAKER_01]: you cheaping out of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Soup it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make it easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take as much pride in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bloom area.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've already talked about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a second ago I asked about a trim
bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: How is your harvest set up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have, oh I'm gonna say now,
how about a good camera?
[SPEAKER_01]: How about a good magnifying glass?
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the kind of magnifiers that hooks
up to your computer so you could see the
[SPEAKER_01]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something to think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how's your harvest set up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a comfortable chair?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a good light?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a trim bin?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said a moment ago, do you have a
scope to check the trichomes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a good camera to take good
photos of these buds?
[SPEAKER_01]: How is your harvest area?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the last step of course, well not the
words one more after this, but how is your
[SPEAKER_01]: dry and cure environment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a good safe secure area that
you can control the environment for your
[SPEAKER_01]: dry and cure?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are building grow tents with
an air conditioner in that grow tent just
[SPEAKER_01]: for drying and curing their weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: How is your dry and cure environment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then how's your storage?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you storing your dried and cured
and finished product in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then once you've mastered all of this,
then you get to go buy yourself,
[SPEAKER_01]: how about a rosin press?
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even write that shit down.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about some bubble bags and a rosin
press?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably the next shit to buy,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to make some bubble bags,
whip out some good bubble, then you got to
[SPEAKER_01]: turn that into rosin, then here's where I
was headed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you got all this shit figured out,
we get to celebrate and go buy a really
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking nice rig, a banger, a pillar,
a carb cap, and then depends on if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: a caveman or not you get to get a torch or
the d-nail torchless heating system,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then you get a cool rig and a dabrite.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a dabrite so you're taking your
dabs at the right temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to dabrite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dabrite sponsor me bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode is not officially brought to
you by our friends at dabrite,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if it were the ad would sound like
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yo, big shout out to my friends at dabrite
for keeping all my dabs perfect,
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping me at the right temp, keeping me
perfectly medicated, keeping my banger
[SPEAKER_01]: clean, making my concentrates last and
taste the best that they can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to my friends at dabrite for a
truly marvelous product, one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: products I use the most in my consumption
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to dabrite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, sponsor me boys, but get yourself a
dabrite, then take some fat dabs,
[SPEAKER_01]: get some good, make some good concentrates
with all your cool toys you just got,
[SPEAKER_01]: and enjoy that whole process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Buy yourself a really cool rig and enjoy
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dude, you got me on a super good
ramble.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went from the beginning to the end
here, from all the shit to buy to the
[SPEAKER_01]: grow, then we're pressing it, then we're
fucking dabbing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no more left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing left to do but smile, smile,
smile.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that, bro, go outside, have some
fun, get some sunshine on your skin,
[SPEAKER_01]: go see some music.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, my dude, HD Ben, I think I more
than answered your question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the great contribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check your inbox because you
have got a coupon code for a free pack of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds at ireadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we're going to keep this great
momentum going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got another question here in front of
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one also did come from the grow help
tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: on ireagenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came from our new friend,
Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to my buddy, Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check your inbox because
you've got a coupon code for a free pack
[SPEAKER_01]: of seeds at ireadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, this question goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, when you see strain information
about the parents of a strain and it has
[SPEAKER_01]: three parents, does that mean they
pollinated one female with two males to
[SPEAKER_01]: get that strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's not what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: It said, is that even possible?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that is possible, but you would have
the seeds wouldn't have two dads.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be each seed would have a different
daddy and the same mom is how that would
[SPEAKER_01]: go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I hope this is not a stupid
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has actually come up a few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love your show and your seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some fist bump and some table seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro, I plan to restock the table seeds for
the 420 sale, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure you check for table seeds at
ireadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it says, I cannot wait from your new
friend, Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris, thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what Chris is asking or my
understanding of what Chris is asking,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of times when we see a new strain,
I've got a good example of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now you're going to see,
so I've got a label that says cherry
[SPEAKER_01]: paloma X skunk one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's in parentheses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cherry paloma to skunk number one is in
parentheses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that is X blueberry F5.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is going on there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are there three plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what happens was the cherry skunk
or the bed, that's what it became.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the cherry paloma to skunk number one,
it didn't have an official name for a
[SPEAKER_01]: little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just got labeled whatever why keep
calling it the cherry paloma to skunk
[SPEAKER_01]: number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it was called for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't get an official name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not every plant gets an official name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everything has like, like,
like that's the best I could say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everything has an official name.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just list it as the cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before it became cherry skunk and got
an official name, it was just written as
[SPEAKER_01]: cherry paloma X skunk one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was what that cross is before it got
a name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when you breed to that, you're going
to put an X and here's a rule that I wish
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody would follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a horticultural industry standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to botany, horticulture,
flowers, other industries that are not
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, it is customary in a breeding
project to list ladies first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anytime, so I just said cherry paloma
to skunk one, there's no question to an
[SPEAKER_01]: experienced cultivator that the cherry
paloma, I said it first, that's the girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skunk one, I said it second, that is the
boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cherry paloma to skunk one,
we know the girl to the boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how that usually goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to go back to the cherry
skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got cherry paloma, skunk one in
parentheses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm going to put an X next to that and
I'm going to write blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what the fuck is going on here?
[SPEAKER_01]: What that indicates is I took the what is
now called cherry skunk, the cherry paloma
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberry in parentheses.
[SPEAKER_01]: The parentheses indicate that is one
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the parentheses, the brackets
there are for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we X that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The new thing on the other side of that X
should be the new male.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means I have now pollinated the
cherry skunk with the blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually that's how that's going to
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my labeling, that's how that's going to
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason that you saw three plants
there, and depending on where your
[SPEAKER_01]: parentheses are, whatever is in the
parentheses, that is, I'm going to quit
[SPEAKER_01]: saying that word because I hate the word
now, whatever is in that box is one plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could put, and this is going to get
convoluted, I might need to get a pen and
[SPEAKER_01]: paper to make this shit work in my brain,
you could do golden goat, X, daybreaker in
[SPEAKER_01]: parentheses, and then you could cross
that, it would go X to, let's pick another
[SPEAKER_01]: strain, jack the ripper, X, arise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the convergence as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could cross those two things
together and that's going to make a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: new thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's two crosses, two, two crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of what the breeder is doing there is
letting you know a little bit of pedigree,
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit of prominence, a little bit
of history about that plant is what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes it just becomes fucking
confusing for a new breeder, for a new
[SPEAKER_01]: grower, for somebody reading these labels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're trying to do is let you know
what the parents are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now maybe you'll see a bracket and then an
equation in parentheses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll have bracket, parentheses,
golden goat, times, daybreaker,
[SPEAKER_01]: parentheses, X, lemon, Jeffrey,
bracket.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all one fucking plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all one plant because it's in that
bracket, that's all one plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was whatever was in the parentheses
bred to the one outside of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there would be an X to breed that
to something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually, and it depends on where the
guy are putting, and gals are a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: lady breeders in the game now,
welcome, it's good, great to have you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people putting the parentheses
in weird places and it just depends on
[SPEAKER_01]: where the parentheses and the X and the
bracket lies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to have a female plant to
a male plant most of the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: but how was that broken down?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's also going to be female plant to
male plant and female plant to male plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of algebra, but it's not as
difficult as our brains want it to be once
[SPEAKER_01]: we figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just think of it as boys girl times boy
girl, or boy girl times boy, because
[SPEAKER_01]: right, you could cross two plants that
don't have a name to a boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that could also be crossed to a
bunch of other shit on the other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you understand, once it clicks in,
it'll all make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not nearly as hard as we want it to
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: The boy should be first, the lady should
be first, girls should be second every
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even going to edit that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just trying to catch up with my own
brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling me where we are now,
not you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies first, male second, and then that
applies to everything on this side of the
[SPEAKER_01]: X.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was probably the lady and on this
side is probably the boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just fucking confusing both of us at
this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why we're going to do it now is bro,
just go get your free seeds and have fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris, thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one got me rambling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I answered your question.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way that I wrote it was plant A to
plant B in parentheses is one plant times
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen donor is how what your talking
about probably goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So dude, thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for letting me confuse
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need clarity on this, argue in the
comment section.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to see the feedback in the
comment section.
