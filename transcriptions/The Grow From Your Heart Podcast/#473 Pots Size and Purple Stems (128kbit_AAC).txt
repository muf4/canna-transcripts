[SPEAKER_00]: What is it working?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen boys and girls pimps
and hoes chicks and bros friends and foes
[SPEAKER_00]: smokers and growers Dad stars weed
smokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up boys and girls?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 473 of the grow
from your heart podcast This episode of
[SPEAKER_00]: the show is brought to you by our friends
at seeds here now If you need new regular
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized or auto flower seeds in your
garden I highly recommend seeds here now
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can find them at www.seedsherenow
.com You know, I like to start this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast off by talking about what I'm
smoking today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a special treat I have got some
banana orange cookies full spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: extract from my friends at green dot labs
This is a blend of banana kush and orange
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies The label says it should taste
like banana orange smoothie, but I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it tastes more like banana kush and orange
cookies This concentrate was delicious and
[SPEAKER_00]: it got me stoned as fuck a lot of times
the concentrate will get me high It makes
[SPEAKER_00]: my eyes kind of bug out of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me go Super fast and talkative
this shit made me want to just sit down I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to chill out after dabbing the
banana orange cookies full spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: extract I'm flipping it over to read the
back of the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says that this product contains 77%
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna crack it open to give you a
fresh smell The first aroma is straight-up
[SPEAKER_00]: orange Julius if you've ever had like an
orange smoothie.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the original aroma that hits you
followed by a hint of cookie dough with
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a touch of black pepper and I know
that's a really interesting aroma a combo
[SPEAKER_00]: of flavors there But my nose picks up a
lot of stuff when you dab it It tastes
[SPEAKER_00]: just like you're smoking the banana kush
and orange cookies If you know what those
[SPEAKER_00]: strains taste like it's got that smooth
cushy flavor Maybe a hint of the banana
[SPEAKER_00]: runs and then it has got also a really
orange smoothie sort of a flavor So big
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to our friends at green dot labs
for the delicious full spectrum extract
[SPEAKER_00]: the banana orange cookies full spectrum
extract Obviously, I'm stoned as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen in this episode.

[SPEAKER_00]: Alright podcast world at the start of the
show I did say I was going to read some
[SPEAKER_00]: listener emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get right into that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a grow question a
cultivation question a cannabis culture
[SPEAKER_00]: question I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is grow from your heart
at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first email in today's episode goes
just like this says hey my name is and
[SPEAKER_00]: then at the end they say I would like to
remain anonymous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my name is anonymous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a first time grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing for my dad since he is quit
using fentanyl patches after 10 years and
[SPEAKER_00]: now uses cannabis for his pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purchasing from dispensaries has become
expensive so we have decided to start
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of good stuff to talk about
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a first time grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So welcome to the club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I'm able to guide you through this
and give you a good first grow experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I make it easier for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congrats to your dad for quitting the
fentanyl patches for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit is not good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that cannabis is able to ease the
pain and I hope that it makes his life
[SPEAKER_00]: more enjoyable and I hope it makes your
time together more enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you were totally correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purchasing from a dispensary can get quite
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is where many folks like yourself
decide to start growing their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email goes on to say I have a question
about planting right into the final pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example planting into a five gallon
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you have to carefully water it
until its roots grow into the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would just like to hear the pros and
cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being a first time grower makes everything
really intimidating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though I've had some help from an
experienced friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a great question about pot
size.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get into that in just a
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep reading the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I built a grow cabinet for stealth
growing since it's illegal to grow within
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 miles of any dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I really don't like that rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since there's a shop 25 miles away they
don't think you should be able to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people that are 26 miles away can
produce a product that they can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not fair in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing I can do about that except express
my opinion that it's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dimensions of our grow box is four
feet by two feet and five and a half feet
[SPEAKER_00]: tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got very minimal space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still adequate space to provide our own
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light source is an LED HLG V2 3000 K
quantum board with an AC infinity T4 fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm planting into organic soil with a 70
30 mix of perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sounds good so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH I don't worry about too much of the
pH in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're at 80 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be a little bit warm with
about 50 to 55 percent relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just planted my first seed yesterday
into a five gallon smart pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep everything organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far it sounds like you've got a good
idea and you're off to a good start.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wraps up with I love your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just getting into them and I'm
learning so much from listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for reading from your friend
anonymous.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of great stuff in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said they are listening and learning
so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a lot of effort into this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to know that at least one person is
learning that means a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about the main
question here planting into the final pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this person has planted their first
seedling directly into a five gallon smart
[SPEAKER_00]: pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have got a 70 30 mix of perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're planted into organic soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like they've got a decent grow
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their main question is they would like to
hear the pros and cons of directly
[SPEAKER_00]: planting into that five gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are pros and cons to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would prefer to go into a smaller
container first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as my plant gets larger of course I
would transplant into a larger container
[SPEAKER_00]: until I was in the final pot which that
plant would finish in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several advantages to starting
in a smaller container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will start my seedlings or my clones in
a very small pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not uncommon for me to start
seedlings or clones in a beer cup or a six
[SPEAKER_00]: inch net pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I use a beer cup I poke plenty of holes
in the bottom of the cup to get plenty of
[SPEAKER_00]: drainage or I will use a four inch or a
six inch net pot for small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about why I do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to use as much water to water
a cup or a four inch or a six inch net pot
[SPEAKER_00]: as I would if I were trying to saturate a
three a five or a seven gallon pot filled
[SPEAKER_00]: with this soil or soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in a small personal garden these small
details may not matter a whole lot but
[SPEAKER_00]: when I get to a commercial scale when I've
got a whole bunch of plants this is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to make a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only need one cup of water to water two
cups with plants in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I've got them in seven gallon pots it's
going to take me two maybe four gallons of
[SPEAKER_00]: water to fully saturate those seven gallon
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you scale that up and scale that up
on a commercial environment each gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes more expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm putting nutrients in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to have a person mix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to have a person pH it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything starts to get more costly as we
scale things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't need as much water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need as much nutrient if I'm using
a smaller container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also give myself less of a chance of
drowning or over watering my plant if I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: using a smaller container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds backwards and that
large container you need to fully saturate
[SPEAKER_00]: all of that soil or soilless mix or cocoa
the first time you put that plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a lot of volume to saturate
which is going to take a large volume of
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plant is going to get really wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That container is going to take a really
long time to dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plant will have a very good
opportunity to get root rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be too much water for too
long in that container.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you over water that smaller container
it will dry up much more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got an opportunity to rescue
that plant and you're not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: pouring in as much water anyway because
the container is not as large and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not attempting to saturate as much soil,
soilless mix, cocoa, whatever you've
[SPEAKER_00]: chosen to put in your container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first advantage is you don't need
as much water and you run less of a risk
[SPEAKER_00]: of drowning that plant on the first couple
of waterings.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second advantage is those smaller pots
don't require as much space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that doesn't really make a big deal in
a small personal grow but as we expand to
[SPEAKER_00]: a commercial environment every inch costs
a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real estate is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every square foot of my grow needs to be
filled with productive plants and I also
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be able to fit as many plants as I
can in some of these tight veg spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be a bit of a waste of space
for me to put small plants into three,
[SPEAKER_00]: five, or seven gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about it a five gallon pot is
probably approximately 14 to 16 inches
[SPEAKER_00]: around and even when you press a bunch of
five gallon pots together you still waste
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of space because even when the
pots are edge to edge you get that little
[SPEAKER_00]: diamond worth of space between each pot
that you cannot fill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So five gallon pots eat up a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could reduce all of that space by
putting the plants into four or six inch
[SPEAKER_00]: net pots and I can fit probably I'm just
guessing about 20, 25, maybe 30,
[SPEAKER_00]: four inch net pots under a t5 light
comfortably and I'm visualizing in my head
[SPEAKER_00]: that I can maybe fit six or eight maybe
nine or 12, five or seven gallon pots
[SPEAKER_00]: under the same t5 light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that takes up a lot of unnecessary
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a commercial environment when you
start expanding the numbers that space
[SPEAKER_00]: really gets eaten up quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really like to utilize my space by
using a smaller pot and then when the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant grows into that pot that's when I up
pot it to the next pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that brings me to the next reason I
prefer to start in smaller pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants are healthy, if they're
being fed well, if they're getting a good
[SPEAKER_00]: root inoculation some sort of beneficial
fungus and some microbes and you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: good lighting on them and they aren't
experiencing any problems and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: being watered properly we should start
seeing some dynamic explosive root growth
[SPEAKER_00]: and those pots should get filled quite
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as those pots are kind of filled
and the plants are getting a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: root bound that's when I like to
transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to flip the pot upside down and get
the plant out to where the plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging between my middle finger and my
ring finger to where the plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: completely upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I basically lift the pot off of the
plant like it's the lid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I've got the roots in my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've usually got so much root development
that the cocoa stays completely pressed
[SPEAKER_00]: together at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing falls out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how tight I let them grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will take my fingers of my other hand
and just dig it directly into the middle
[SPEAKER_00]: of the bottom of that pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going now it's the top because
the plants upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going straight in from the top
directly in the middle and just wiggle my
[SPEAKER_00]: fingers a little bit and my idea is to
just break those roots up and break that
[SPEAKER_00]: dirt up a little bit to where when I put
it into the next pot those roots just take
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say oh I was in there a little bit
tight but now watch me explode and watch
[SPEAKER_00]: me stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you transplant properly into the next
pot if you don't bury them too deep if you
[SPEAKER_00]: sprinkle like a little root inoculant
maybe some recharge or something like that
[SPEAKER_00]: on there and you bury them properly and
then you water them properly and put them
[SPEAKER_00]: back under the right lights and give them
enough airflow and enough love those roots
[SPEAKER_00]: will take off and those plants will show
you vigorous robust growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really think that trapping the roots
just a little bit and letting it get just
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit compacted in that pot when
you put it in the next pot it really makes
[SPEAKER_00]: it take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is like hell yeah there is some
freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also it's got big tires now so it can go
romping through the mud.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to have a problem with
drowning it when you transplant into the
[SPEAKER_00]: next container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first advantage to starting with
either a beer cup or a four inch or a six
[SPEAKER_00]: inch net pot or sometimes I even use those
four inch nursery pots or a little six
[SPEAKER_00]: inch nursery pot just something smaller to
consolidate and condense the garden a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main advantage to using something
small like that is it does not take as
[SPEAKER_00]: much soil or soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to start off with so much
soil that you're not going to use right
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you don't need as much water and
nutrients to water that smaller amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: soilless mix or soil or cocoa whatever
you've chosen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't need as much water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need as much nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also you don't run as much risk of
drowning the plants on the initial first
[SPEAKER_00]: few waterings.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a new seedling or you've got
a new clone you do run the risk of
[SPEAKER_00]: drowning that bad bitch at the very
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very sensitive when they just
start developing roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main advantage is less water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second advantage is less space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to waste a seven a three or
a five gallon pot worth of space for a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant you can fit in a six inch net pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a lot more plants under less
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are becoming more efficient when it
comes to commercial environments or
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing costs and a small home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finding ways to become more efficient can
really cut a lot of costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really pay attention and think
about what you're doing this is a great
[SPEAKER_00]: way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can turn off all those extra T5s and
just move all the plants right under this
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can save some money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So less water less space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when we do up pot I see explosive
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the plants really take off
when you go from that six inch pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go from a six to a three and if I
upgrade from the three then I go to a
[SPEAKER_00]: seven and that's usually as big as I go
because I stay indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about that
progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time I start in a clone
machine or in a clone dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will go from the clone machine or the
clone dome usually into a four inch or a
[SPEAKER_00]: six inch net pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I go into a beer cup just
depending on where I'm working.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants will grow in that beer cup or
that net pot until I see that they are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting kind of tight in that container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will actually pull the plant out of the
cup out of the pot and visually inspect
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see thick white spaghetti
looking roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them to be fat and filling that
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them swirled around the outside of
the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I see that container is filled with
roots that is when it is time to up pot to
[SPEAKER_00]: my next container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the genetics depending on
your environment sometimes they stay in
[SPEAKER_00]: these cups for two or four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they will move into their next
container and they will stay there for
[SPEAKER_00]: probably two to four weeks before they go
into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll move from a cup into a three
gallon pot most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those three gallon pots are what I like to
flower in a commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some situations perhaps in a personal
home grow where I may be breeding and my
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers are limited and I want larger
plants I may use a seven gallon pot at
[SPEAKER_00]: that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go from the cup to the three gallon
pot to the seven gallon pot and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: will veg for only about a week in that
seven gallon pot because the plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm about to flip them into flower and I
just want them to be able to develop some
[SPEAKER_00]: roots into that new soil and take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots will keep growing for the first
couple of weeks of flower and I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: I fill that container quite well by the
end of the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also that big seven gallon pot gives me
plenty of time between watering so I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: able to go out of town and go to the Indo
Expo for the weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm able to go see fish for a couple of
days by using that seven gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can water that Friday morning and it
will usually last me until Monday
[SPEAKER_00]: morning's watering without any worries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in most scenarios I go from the cloner
to the cup then into a three gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most situations I flower at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll throw it into a seven,
veg for another week or 10 days,
[SPEAKER_00]: flower them out at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I feel like I really fill that
container with a perfect root mass by the
[SPEAKER_00]: time harvest comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I told you the reasons why I plant into
a smaller container and work my way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You asked for pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pros of starting in a smaller
container I already mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less space, less water, you're more
efficient in general and then you get that
[SPEAKER_00]: explosive growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cons are you have to plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be on a cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to know when to transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take you more transplant
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have more opportunity to cause damage
to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me talk more about some of the
things I just said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are running a perpetual cycle you
are going to have to transplant plants on
[SPEAKER_00]: a regular cycle or you will fall out of
your routine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work in a commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a crew of guys that I say hey
we've got to get all of these cups into
[SPEAKER_00]: these pots but before we get all of these
cups into these pots we've got to move all
[SPEAKER_00]: of these pots to that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it all flows in one big move.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got two or three guys moving plants
from the veg area to the flower area and
[SPEAKER_00]: as they're emptying space I've got guys
getting cups out of the veg, the small veg
[SPEAKER_00]: area and moving them into the large veg
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if that rhythm gets broken it will
throw everything off for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got one plant that takes too
long to finish or if you've got a week
[SPEAKER_00]: where you don't feel good or if you want
to go out of town and you can't transplant
[SPEAKER_00]: on your cycles your plants will show it in
the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also each of those transplants will give
you another opportunity to cause stress to
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not an experienced gardener and
you're not good at potting the plants you
[SPEAKER_00]: will cause a little bit of stress to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am very confident in myself and the guys
in the facilities in which I operate so I
[SPEAKER_00]: know that they can get the plants out of
the small pot and get it right into that
[SPEAKER_00]: big pot and those plants will never show
you a sign that they slowed down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time the next day they're like
hey we're going bro thank you for the new
[SPEAKER_00]: shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're a new grower you're not
super experienced you may have some
[SPEAKER_00]: questions you may try some new shit you
may make some little mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows what's going to happen in your
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do get the opportunity to cause
stresses during each transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the advantages though you don't
have to transplant a bunch of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm transplanting one or two times
and that's stressful and I've got a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants so it takes a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a crew of guys doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could cause a lot of problems to plants
if we fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other advantage is that you already
know how much space your plants are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in that pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how much room you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can watch them grow into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said in the beginning you do have
to be careful with watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure that you don't drown this
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're using smaller containers the
soil or soilless mix has more of an
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we do over water it'll just dry up
and the plants will kind of rescue
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots won't get smothered for too long
and will survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a bigger pot it's going to take longer
for that stuff at the bottom to dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to have a really wet
bottom and a dry top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of your root growth is going to
still be up at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots are going to dig for the bottom
and look for water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll probably find it down there at the
bottom and try to drink from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're really going to have to find the
balance to get the top the right level of
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture and the bottom the right level of
moisture and get that root growth growing
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in a five gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be very careful not to over water and
not to drown this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that pretty much covers it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's read more quickly about the grow
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a small space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's four by two by five and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you don't veg too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are going to get tall quickly
and you've got a short space.
[SPEAKER_00]: The box is five and a half feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably taking up a little bit of
space with the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest using a trellis or some
sort of a net so you can spread the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: out and keep them low.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you can fill that space to its
maximum potential and get a nice harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a good light in this space it
sounds like.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a good fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder about the airflow and the air
exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we getting air in and out of there so
we don't get stagnant air?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a soil pH test which is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't worry too much about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a little bit warm in that grow
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also it may be a little bit too humid and
when you put the plants in there and start
[SPEAKER_00]: watering you're going to get more humidity
especially with that much heat so you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to need to exchange that air.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something that is going to come up
probably a little bit later in the grow as
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants get larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start working more.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll need more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start letting out more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to run into humidity issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would start working on that before it
becomes a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put yourself in scramble mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got some expensive seeds probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got some expensive gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are doing this illegally so you are
putting yourself at risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get this correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to do it, do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get something to reduce that humidity and
that temperature now before we get to that
[SPEAKER_00]: stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck down there in prohibition land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't tell anybody else about your grow
but thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going while I've got this good
flow going.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next message came from, let's see,
it says, hey Rasta Jeff, you can call me
[SPEAKER_00]: Ridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up Ridge?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message says, I am a big fan of your
podcast, your content and your ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: describe a visual image of whatever you
are talking about right into my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is cool man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you because I do a lot of work
trying to describe what I'm talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: in multiple different ways so that
everybody can see what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: People learn in different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are book learners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are listening learners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are reader learners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people actually have to get their
hands dirty to figure out what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really do make an effort to teach in
multiple ways so that I can include
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody and make sure that everybody
learns a little something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for noticing that I'm trying
to describe a visual image and that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get it right into your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ridge goes on to say, I usually listen on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: You helped me out with the tab timer issue
a while back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I remember you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good to hear from you again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on to say, for your new
buddy from France.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a message from a person in France
who had a grow tent and they were
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned about light leaking in and I
recommended some advice to our friend
[SPEAKER_00]: Ridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommended some blackout curtains and
he said those blackout curtains work well
[SPEAKER_00]: for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just hang them around the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost like a dressing room around my tent
and the air comes in under the curtains.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on to say, I stuck Velcro on the
curtain to stick them back out of the way
[SPEAKER_00]: when I work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope this helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers to you and all growers and a big
fuck you to prohibition from your friend
[SPEAKER_00]: Ridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a great idea if you are growing
in a grow tent and you're worried that you
[SPEAKER_00]: may be exposing your plants to light
because a lot of those grow tents are made
[SPEAKER_00]: quite cheaply.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do have very small light leaks in
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a quick tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing in a grow tent,
go inside that bad dog and turn off the
[SPEAKER_00]: light and sit in there for a minute and
see if you were getting any light from the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're getting light in your grow tent,
you need to correct that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to make some adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those light leaks are correctable
just by putting a piece of black tape over
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, many of those tents were
made with a shitty mesh that will allow
[SPEAKER_00]: light to penetrate the walls of the tent
and get to your plants, which will
[SPEAKER_00]: interrupt your night cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where people are trying to find
creative solutions to prevent light leaks
[SPEAKER_00]: in their grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where some people are hanging
blackout curtains around the tent to
[SPEAKER_00]: create a little dressing room for the tent
to prevent light leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are using fabric curtains or some
people are using stuff like panda film or
[SPEAKER_00]: poly film to create a little layer of
protection between the tent and the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I don't know where everybody is
putting their grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have it in a spare bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have got it in the basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people just have it out in the
garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what you've got set up,
but if it is in a room where there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of light and you were concerned with
light leaks, and you were worried about
[SPEAKER_00]: light getting into the tent, this may be
something you could think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not able to use panda film or
some sort of poly film because you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: stay stealth, something like a black sheet
right around the tent doesn't make a big
[SPEAKER_00]: difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still looks like the black tent,
and it still works as a concealment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to hang a big privacy
curtain around the grow tent, you can just
[SPEAKER_00]: make a little flap on the inside or the
outside of the tent, just a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: Velcro like our friend was talking about
here and a little bit of fabric and a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of creativity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can solve all of these problems
without stressing yourself out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it mostly depends on the quality of
the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you getting a lot of large light
leaks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you getting just a couple of small
pinholes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do we really need to prevent a lot of
light from getting in?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when you make the decision to use
a little bit of tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I use a couple of pieces of tape just
to stick those over these little pinholes
[SPEAKER_00]: and prevent that light coming in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you use a little bit of fabric and
make a little Velcro curtain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you actually need to make a little
privacy curtain around the grow tent and
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent light from getting into your
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: But big shout out to our buddy Ridge here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our buddy Ridge says that he's using black
out curtains and it works well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Ridge was brilliant enough to use
that stoner ingenuity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got some Velcro and they put Velcro
at the top of the tent and at the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: of that curtain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all they got to do now is just Velcro
that up there and they've got a little
[SPEAKER_00]: easy access, a little bit of workspace
without a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So use that stoner ingenuity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let little problems stress you out
in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke a fat joint, a little bit of
creativity will go a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a big shout out to our
buddy Ridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next email on today's show goes just
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy the podcast tremendously.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I've missed one since
hearing and seeing you on Embracing
[SPEAKER_00]: Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in case some people don't know,
just about every Thursday I go on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Embracing Organics live podcast on YouTube
and I hang out with my friends and we talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sometimes it gets a little bit
weird later in the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: But join us on Thursdays on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply search for the Embracing Organics
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We generally try to start the show around
7 or 7.30 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain Time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So join us for the live show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Search for Embracing Organics on Thursday
around 7 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain Time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for the video with the live icon next
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red live icon means we are live at
that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join the chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can ask us your cannabis questions and
we will try to answer them live on the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get back to this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says this is by far the best form of
learning for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love hearing that people are learning
from our podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are listening to the Embracing
Organics podcast and you're listening to
[SPEAKER_00]: my show, you are absolutely getting a good
solid cannabis education foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you enjoy my show and if you're
enjoying the Embracing Organics show,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you would also enjoy the Dude
Grows show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're not already listening to the
Dude Grows show, I would strongly suggest
[SPEAKER_00]: that you give them a subscribe button.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subscribe and listen because you will
learn a lot from them as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you're ready to expand your
knowledge, I think you can learn even more
[SPEAKER_00]: from the Cannabis Cultivation and Sciences
podcast with Tad Hussie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really strongly suggest the Shaping
Fire podcast with Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get a good foundation with the Dude
Grows with my show and with Embracing
[SPEAKER_00]: Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you're ready to step up a little
bit, that's when you want to check out
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Cultivation and Sciences with Tad
Hussie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would also again suggest Shaping
Fire with Shango Los.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are two other podcasts that will
really expand your cannabis growing
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's jump back into the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, can you shed some light on why I
get purple stems from time to time,
[SPEAKER_00]: then they fade back to green?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great question, but without more
details, without more info or maybe some
[SPEAKER_00]: photos, it is going to be hard for me to
accurately diagnose what is happening with
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately, what I can say is that a
little bit of purple stem is probably not
[SPEAKER_00]: too much of a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I don't know what else is happening
in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about your temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about your humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about your diurnal shifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anything about what's going
on in that room other than you've got some
[SPEAKER_00]: ganja plants in there and they're getting
some purple stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the little information I've got,
let's talk about what it could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be temperature related,
depending on where this is happening in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant, what part of the plant this
could be from the plant getting cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you getting cold night temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you having warm daytime temps and then
lower nighttime temperatures?
[SPEAKER_00]: That can absolutely encourage purple
stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now by purple stems, do you mean the main
stalk of the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you mean the branches or do you mean
the pedials, the actual stems of the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves?
[SPEAKER_00]: If the tops of the pedials are turning
purple, maybe a reddish color,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is possibly because they're getting
too cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this can also be a nutrient issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be phosphorus or potassium
related.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, since I can't see the plants,
since I can't see your PL grow monitor
[SPEAKER_00]: information and tell you what's been
happening in that grow for the past few
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks, it is hard for me to diagnose the
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: One hint is that you say the plants turn,
you get purple stems from time to time and
[SPEAKER_00]: then they fade back to green.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my mind, that makes me think that it is
probably a temperature issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting too cold overnight one
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they get really purple from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But over the next few days, they start
warming up and they start getting green
[SPEAKER_00]: again and going back to their normal life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're probably getting another cold
snap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants are getting those purple
stems all over again and it's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: freaking you out, which makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could also simply be something that
that plant does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: As that plant grows, it may turn purple at
one point and then it also may go right
[SPEAKER_00]: back to green.
[SPEAKER_00]: How experienced are you with that
particular plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it one strain that's doing it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it one phenotype that's doing it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it the entire garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it one section?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it one row?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it one area?
[SPEAKER_00]: Without having more information,
it is really hard for me to pinpoint and
[SPEAKER_00]: diagnose the exact problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would start by checking on temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would check out the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would start dialing it in row by
row, plant by plant and start eliminating
[SPEAKER_00]: things that it could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will show you what it actually
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the best I can do for you with
the limited information that I have got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to thank you again for listening
to the Embracing Organics show and of
[SPEAKER_00]: course for listening to my show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, again, I do encourage you
to listen to the Dude Grows podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want me to follow up with this
question, send me some details.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happening in your grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what the nighttime
temperatures are?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what the daytime temperatures
are?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what the VPD is in the night
and day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what you've been feeding these
plants for the past few weeks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in veg?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you indoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like a lot more information and I
may be able to dial in and diagnose the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem if there even is a problem with
your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good news is a little bit of purpling
might not even be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could just be genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Reese, I want to thank you once
again for the great compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do look forward to getting some
photos and some details about what is
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in your garden so we can help
you diagnose and dial in what is happening
[SPEAKER_00]: with your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World, that is all I've
