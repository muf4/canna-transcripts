[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode 300.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, joining me on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awkwardly and high as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got Kevin right in front of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You haven't been here in a while,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for coming back.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks for coming, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to have you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for dabbing with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brought a sweet new rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brought some great terps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Made a hell of an entrance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, to my left, a regular regular
visitor, a repeat offender, I like to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cracker Mike is here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, White Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, 300 episodes, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been this excited for a podcast
in a long time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, welcome to the show, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a couple of things I wanted to
highlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: 300 episodes and four years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think right around the date that this
show comes out will be four years of
[SPEAKER_01]: podcasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, that's lined up pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then also in February, we had 10,000
downloads on Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of landmarks going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's super cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I wrote down 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to add more zeros.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck, we're high as giraffe pussy over
here, aren't we?
[SPEAKER_01]: 100,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: You forgot a whole zero, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only wrote down 10,000 here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't say 90% of the number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a zero or a comma?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, we'll just change it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, in February.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dang.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got 100,000 downloads on Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cute.
[SPEAKER_01]: The celebration sounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right before we hit record, I suggested we
all take another dab and that might have
[SPEAKER_03]: been unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to hit one more bullet point and
then we'll talk about what we were smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: on because I always start the show talking
about what we were smoking on,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we got one more thing we got to
celebrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin, today on the day that we're
recording is 20 months alcohol-free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congrats, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said 20 months, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 months.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been fucking up the start of the show
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm proud of you and that means a lot to
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it means a lot to you, but it means
a lot to me that you did that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just a decision I made and
fortunately, enough, I was able to just
[SPEAKER_04]: make it and do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still hung out with all the same
friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still went to local shows at bars and
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't really shy away.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was on a pool league, so that was all at
bars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had free drinks offered to me by
close friends and whatnot, and it's just
[SPEAKER_04]: something I don't want.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost like tobacco or cigarettes or
something.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just something that's not appealing
and something I just don't care for and
[SPEAKER_04]: don't want anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was able to make a bunch of even more
positive changes in my life, so it's
[SPEAKER_04]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was able to get my own car, my own place
to live, have a pretty stable life now,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is much better than it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was ruining all the relationships that I
had, so coming completely around and being
[SPEAKER_04]: able to earn most of those back even with
the people that I hurt the most and was
[SPEAKER_04]: the closest with is something that I'm
really grateful for and I'm proud of.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to keep going on the same
road and keep building and continue my
[SPEAKER_04]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now you're on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got 100,000 listens, so now you got
some accountability, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100,000 people are rooting for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need accountability.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got my own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's the attitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to try to steal your
thunder, but I quit drinking a long time
[SPEAKER_01]: ago also, and that point when it doesn't
even become a thing, it feels so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: When someone's like, you want a beer?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, no, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want a beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because for a long time, they'd say,
do you want a beer?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd say, fucking yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want them cold, frosty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want dark beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want them in my hand, and then I want
them in my mouth, and then just hand me
[SPEAKER_01]: another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I used to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when that feeling goes away,
it's just like, oh, it's kind of release.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, you don't have that pressure
on your body, your mind, your brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of drives you crazy just wanting
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one less thing to desire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got my respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad to have you back on the crew,
back on the team.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never went away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just sometimes we got to go through our
own things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, I went through some
negative things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've made amends with all the people I
can make amends with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's all I can do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just going to keep forward with
the positivity from here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want people to follow you on any
sort of social media?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm only on Instagram right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's at elevated concentrations.
[SPEAKER_04]: All one word.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to come check it out,
I got drum pictures and hash pictures and
[SPEAKER_04]: positive pictures and just cool stuff that
I post every now and then.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't overblow nut and nut.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I got some cool stuff on there to
check out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You saying I overblow shit?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just I don't have a lot of I don't share
every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not a lot of content, but it's
cool content.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always positive stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check out my boy Kev.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out elevated concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out his hash pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always share love with all the with the
community.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I love I love local stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kev's been a part of the the Colorado hash
community since the beginning.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been art, music, cannabis,
about all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spread the love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to go hang out at the Rhino
district.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to go hang out at Adam Dunn's
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to do all the events together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to take Kev with me all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Met some cool people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cracker Mike, since I let Kev plug his
stuff, how can all these people find you
[SPEAKER_01]: on social media so they can stalk you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Follow me.
[SPEAKER_03]: The two places to do that best are Pueblo
for sensible cannabis laws on Facebook or
[SPEAKER_03]: NemoPunk15 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: NemoPunk15 on Twitter, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: He tweets a lot of good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: He retweets a lot of good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Follow him there.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's mostly been retweets lately.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But make sure you check out Pueblo for
sensible cannabis laws because that's
[SPEAKER_03]: where all the wonder happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their opposition is growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they're getting bad, shitty guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun lately.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come follow me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Support Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just don't when you find out when you
realize who his opposition is,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's another Facebook group and they are
several dozen now, but they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: educated in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And please don't approach them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to be nice, Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to be nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not trying to release the iry army on
these people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe gravity hasn't gotten most
of these bitches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be polite to them and speak factually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't call them names.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't stoop to their level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Play like an adult.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inform them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Educate them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't speak emotionally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Speak with facts and knowledge and just
come at them with respect and care for the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis and the knowledge you're trying
to spread.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You represent myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: You represent Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: You represent Kevin.
[SPEAKER_04]: You represent every cannabis plant.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Represent the industry and the plant and
exactly the patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: Represent.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things about our community that
I always kind of shake my head at is we do
[SPEAKER_03]: not always represent ourselves well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people kind of they show me
hatred because I'm a dreadlocked white guy
[SPEAKER_01]: doing a cannabis show and they're like,
yeah, you're everything we're against.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, I'm well spoken.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to do my thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's there's ways to disagree and have
a conversation without it being an
[SPEAKER_04]: argument.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go interact with Mike's Facebook
rivalry there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said earlier that we're going to talk
about what we're smoking on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But apparently we smoke so much of it that
we don't know what the fuck's going on
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started off where did we start off?
[SPEAKER_01]: We started off with some Kev, tell me
about the the rockin extracts you were
[SPEAKER_01]: passing me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got some rockin extracts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rockstar Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: That Rockstar Kush is what we started with
and it gave me a nice eye high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made me nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a little bit of a CBD level in
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of it's kind of got got some
of something going.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty nice after a long day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then next was some sour strawberry
from Garden of Whedon, which is quite
[SPEAKER_04]: delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Much love and respect to everybody at the
Garden of Whedon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good friends, good family, good people,
amazing extract artists, great
[SPEAKER_01]: photographers, huge members of the
community that we need, that we love and
[SPEAKER_01]: respect and support all the way through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much love to those guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not too sure on the label or anything
where the flower came from exactly,
[SPEAKER_04]: but whoever grew it was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this most recent batch of Garden of
Whedon, sour strawberry, whoever grew that
[SPEAKER_04]: material was awesome spot on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice work folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the extract was fantastic as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big up Garden of Whedon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out Garden of Whedon once again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Miss you kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hang out more frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go see them occasionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not often enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we shifted into Mike brought some
sour diesel live resin from CSC,
[SPEAKER_01]: Concentrate Supply Company.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just straight fuel.
[SPEAKER_01]: They opened the jar and Kev goes,
that's gasoline.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just said it like, like, I don't know,
like a kid licking a window.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's gasoline.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, yes, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all you can smell right now is
gasoline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't dab one of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I just didn't grab one.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those I could have, I chose to
smoke some Skywalker batter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been talking about the Skywalker
batter for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody knows what that's like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we upped our game.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when everybody went full art hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: We grabbed some of these Clementine,
high cannabinoid, full spectrum extract
[SPEAKER_01]: crystals that are, they're calling it the
diamonds.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were two, maybe three, two in a tiny
piece in here that were the gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's high cannabinoid, full spectrum
extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chunks.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are two half gram chunks in this
container.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took medium sized dabs and coughed our
faces off and then giggled for about 10
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had to take a little break.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we decided to record and it feels
like we may have taken too short of a
[SPEAKER_01]: break.
[SPEAKER_03]: We ended up giggle high, yo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a long minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mission fucking accomplished.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got that like weird, my face feels
strange.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like looking around the room,
like, is this where we are?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is, it is where we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then after that, I thought I'd get stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're calling this the ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got some big crystals in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some big THC crystals and a lot of terpy
sauce.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a nice sized dab of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys made fun of me because when I
dabbed it, my face turned different
[SPEAKER_01]: colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's looking at the concentrates right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good lord.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little diamonds and some sauce,
right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, jeez.
[SPEAKER_03]: How much came in that container
originally?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just took one tiny dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just a gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it looks like three from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, I'm like, damn it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish there was way more in that
container.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a container in the angle,
but that was crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's gorilla glue number four.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's because one diamond is one dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was something I was going to segue
into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good work, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin brought up the theory that it's like
nachos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm calling it the nacho theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's stuck together, it's one dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, you just took a minuscule dab of
this Clementine.
[SPEAKER_01]: High cannabinoid, full spectrum extract,
diamond, crystal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine what would happen to you if you
dabbed that thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 0.7.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one right there is probably 0.2.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say that's 0.6.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just guessing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably 0.6 of a gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say 0.6 and 0.3 or 0.6 and 0.4-ish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would cough till next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, you're going to cough just looking
at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, it's tickling my throat.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just pedocular.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, you'd be so lit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's impressive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm done with your nacho theory.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like the theory of the dude
who sells the diamonds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember whose page I read that
on, but I read it on somebody's Instagram
[SPEAKER_04]: page.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was the profile not apothecary sales rep?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like nachos.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys, it's like nacho.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, because then someone's going to come
to your house and just dab all your
[SPEAKER_01]: shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just going to squish.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like nachos, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like the edible episode where you
were like, this is what I eat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, don't tell people that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because somebody on vacation is going to
be like, Rasta Jeff, said this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we figured we'll split it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't eat edibles or dab like me unless
you're experienced, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will lead to disaster and naps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to add a disclaimer to
the front of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, we are not
professionals, but we do play some on
[SPEAKER_01]: podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we professionals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pros get paid.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where that line gets drawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of getting paid, that's a good
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are setting up segues like
champions for me at the start of this
[SPEAKER_01]: episode, which is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're going to take dabs and just
start getting to the fun part of this
[SPEAKER_01]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you watch the YouTube videos,
and don't forget to watch the YouTube
[SPEAKER_01]: videos, you guys, the Grow From Your Heart
Podcast YouTube channel, there are 200
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube videos up now, which means that
there are 100 episodes in the feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got 201 through 300 in the feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got one through 200 on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can listen to all the podcast episodes
right now, which is pretty cool,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of caught up for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still need to make more videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's what I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the old episodes have other people's
music in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And YouTube hates me for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I post a new video,
it's like copyright claim, copyright
[SPEAKER_01]: violation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not doing anything to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just saying I can't monetize the
page and they limit things and advertising
[SPEAKER_01]: for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't put me in other people's like
up and coming videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't get as much play because I'm using
other people's copyrighted shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you noticed at the start of the
show, I played a brand new track that was
[SPEAKER_01]: produced by Rasta Jeff with GarageBand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll hear some new music coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why there's different music.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to not piss off YouTube so
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So starting with episode 300, there will
be new music.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll probably have to stop using other
people's music unless you've got music
[SPEAKER_01]: that you have produced and you would like
to hear on the podcast and you can give me
[SPEAKER_01]: full permission to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I put it up on YouTube and they flag
me and say, hey, you can't do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to piss me off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't put some music up there that you
can't give me full copyright and
[SPEAKER_01]: permission to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've published it on iTunes or
YouTube, I probably can't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you would like to make me a track or
make me some music, I'd love to play your
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, there's a lot of artists out there
that would like to get their stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: exposed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me a message,
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love to listen to your tracks,
see what kind of music you got.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put it in the background.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll play it at the start, I'll play it at
the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see what you got.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious what that just did to your
inbox.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love when my inbox explodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they're for.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're supposed to get your message box
filled with stuff, it's not supposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: sit there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interact with me guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me some music.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to hear what kind of music you got
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course I like reggae.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have to be reggae.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to send me something to
start a show with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's enunciate that it doesn't have to be
reggae.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's an intro track, it's got a
kick in the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, wow, what up?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Ross DeJeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just got to be fucking, it's got to
hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I shout someone out?
[SPEAKER_04]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mark LeBlanc or Project 432.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen Project 432.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen those guys at the Black Sheep a
couple of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: They open for a lot of other acts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I saw them open for Morgan
Heritage one night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good band.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty decent bros with the drummer,
Mark LeBlanc.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're listening or whatever,
I'll make sure I share this with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys have a dub track that you
recorded.
[SPEAKER_04]: They got all kinds of extra stuff that
they just jack around with.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that they have it put on their
albums and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if they got something that they want to
throw down, that would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can layer all of the voicing over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I've got mics and editing gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just give me some backing tracks and
I'll do all the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got something like 45 seconds long,
something about two minutes long,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then something like 10 minutes long,
I would use all of those in certain spots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, if you're listening, go check out
Project 432.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're a pretty good band.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're pretty new.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been out a little over a year and
they're doing some big things.
[SPEAKER_04]: The drummer's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: The drummer's pretty hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's been through a lot of bands.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's been drumming since literally he was
one.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a picture of him with a drum set.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're youngsters.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're young dudes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've got a lot of young cat energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have the same, that old reggae
guy energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got youngster reggae energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's rolling his eyes.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm just trying to picture young
reggae.
[SPEAKER_03]: Revolution versus Bob Marley.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any idea how hard it's been
not to fucking get a little poke in right
[SPEAKER_03]: now and then you're gonna tease one out of
me?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, if one reggae song's been flagged by
YouTube, how are the rest getting by?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's not a fan of reggae.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not that at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just, you asked, so you got the poke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom, chicka, boom, chicka.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, if that got flagged in one song,
doesn't it catch it in all of them?
[SPEAKER_03]: Ouch.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Mike's trying to stab at us.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, this podcast is not gonna be one
of the episodes where you need to get out
[SPEAKER_01]: a notebook and take a bunch of notes
apparently.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is gonna be one where Kevin and Mike
and myself get really high and hashtag
[SPEAKER_01]: they like it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're gonna teach you about what it's
like in the studio when we all baked as
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you guys are kind of just joining us
at the table.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can hear Mike's water bottle popping.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just keep teasing me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take a dab, bro, don't be afraid to take a
dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk myself out of it, but get yourself
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, take a dab, don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been talking myself out of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a torch.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had quite a few so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as I can keep talking,
everything will be okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not afraid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no one else saw us devolve into
giggles for... I don't get afraid of
[SPEAKER_04]: really anything dab related.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not taking more dabs, not anything dab
related.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait till Jeff turns the fucking sound off
in your headphones as you're hitting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I turned off Mike's mic because I knew
he was gonna cough and he thought he went
[SPEAKER_01]: deaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sound in my headphones went too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I realized that, I exclaimed,
I'm so glad that's not the weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wish I had been recording,
but unfortunately it was not.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was one of those beautiful moments,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could not stop laughing over that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of those fun side effects of
fucking all the anti-weed propaganda I
[SPEAKER_03]: sift through every day is like every time
I get a good hit and it rings my bell a
[SPEAKER_03]: minute, I'm like, ooh, is this the weed
psychosis I've heard about?
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I finally gonna see some shit?
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I just get a little higher and
then giggle for a minute and then come
[SPEAKER_03]: back down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You haven't gone crazy yet from the devil
weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: From the devil's lettuce?
[SPEAKER_01]: Never gonna stop trying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say you can't OD on cannabis,
but I've been trying.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm starting to get to the point
to think where you might be able to with
[SPEAKER_04]: all the new distillations.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you took like a big two liter or
something and like drank it of like
[SPEAKER_04]: distillate, probably would get pretty
sick.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd imagine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please don't do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't ever try that.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got a two liter of distillate
though, let's kick it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying like the original equation
was something like 45 hay bales worth of
[SPEAKER_03]: bud in like an hour is what it would take
to even approach a lethal dose.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when they did the conversion,
like they were probably working with five
[SPEAKER_03]: or seven percent THC herb.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of what I was thinking.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I've been pondering.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you got pure enough distillate in a
big enough batch of it, like it's you
[SPEAKER_03]: still got to get it into the person and
get it absorbed at that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you try to drink a two liter of
distillate about your third gulp,
[SPEAKER_03]: your body's just going to vomit up four
cups of distillate and all your boys gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: laugh at you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but that's just a little coding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think you can get it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think my body would even let me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like trying to swallow a mouthful
of a whole cup of honey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never tried and I don't plan to.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody would like to donate a cup of
distillate, we'd like to see Kevin.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's for science, bro, for science.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm down to drive to the devil's house
with you, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: So two cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not in on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will keep my throat clear and keep
talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love videotape for fucking research
purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put up the iPad with the fisheye lens
for this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get it going.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're making me want to do this,
which is not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody drink a cup of distillate,
please.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you do, don't blame me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm saying it's a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: If only it were Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do send us music.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't drink distillate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do's and don'ts of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin's just going to giggle for the whole
show now.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: How was that, Deb?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: What'd you dab, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: What did I dab?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I dabbed with rock and extracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a legit question.
[SPEAKER_03]: He looked at the table in awe and had no
idea for a moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got hash to dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where did this come from?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure he had to lick the roof of
his mouth to guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember what it looked like on
the dabber.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was this rock, rock and extracts,
rock star push.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's get serious for a second
on episode 300.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have done four years worth of podcasts,
300 shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a hundred thousand downloads in
February.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin hasn't consumed alcohol in 20
months.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many things to be grateful for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's got a healthy, healthy kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, Mike, I'm trying to include you in
all the celebration here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have that and I've got another one on
the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know if I was supposed to mention
that, so I hesitated.
[SPEAKER_03]: It ain't a secret.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's super pregnant.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's super pregnant now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no having it at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we so far passed 12 weeks,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, congrats on the new one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Numero dosa coming, so if you like having
me on the podcast, we're going to have to
[SPEAKER_03]: figure out a new way to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get Mike a small setup with
a microphone that he can plug into his
[SPEAKER_01]: computer so that we can Skype and do shows
together like that so that he can have a
[SPEAKER_01]: kid on his lap and do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can get away for an hour to a night.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just can't leave the fucking house
because the baby monitor has to be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: blink behind the microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we got you there, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll set you up with something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't drive across town to fucking feed
a kid a bottle or change a diaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once we get another MacBook to replace
this thing, that's going super slow,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll get you a microphone that just plugs
right into your computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll teach you how to use a program.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you got to do is open up Skype.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk on Skype.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll record you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can ramble with me on Skype just like
you can from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like a good way to produce a
fuckload of content.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could probably smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't do that here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cigarette free zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have a tobacco friendly office.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all have a lot of things to be grateful
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm grateful for all the people that
download, listen, support, talk about,
[SPEAKER_01]: share.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's vibrating?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn, Mike, your phone is angry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought there were motorcycles coming or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, what is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the ninjas here.
Damn.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like a dildo race.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, that was just the vibrate
feature on the new phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't learned all the bells and
whistles yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, fucking 300 shows is the first one I
think I've interrupted with a cell phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've got that to be grateful for.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll put it back on track.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, something new here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm grateful for all the people that
support the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have been supporting on Twitter,
Facebook, Instagram, through Patreon quite
[SPEAKER_01]: a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are reaching out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get private messages on all of my social
media and they say, hey, dude,
[SPEAKER_01]: thanks for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: People tell me that I brighten up their
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: People tell me that our interactions help
them with their life.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just change their attitude,
their approach to life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently I'm the only person that some
people interact with, which is kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather not go out in public and deal
with a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's just, it doesn't seem like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you know me, that's one of our
community character traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was more often than not as a grower for
so long that I just became a hermit and
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't want to deal with other people
because then they were probably snitches
[SPEAKER_01]: or thieves or cops or a problem if they
weren't somebody that I already knew.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of made me weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I get a lot of my social interaction
from the social media people that listen
[SPEAKER_01]: to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And interact with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys mean a lot to me also,
and I appreciate that and all the support.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do put a lot of work into the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like a bunch of dudes just
sitting here getting stoned today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: 200 and something other episodes is me
putting a lot of work into this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got, you guys can testify for this
show.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a notebook in like three days of
planning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, well, just to get these guys here,
like is an orchestration just to get three
[SPEAKER_01]: growers in a room together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes a lot, but I've got,
you called me a crow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're all in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the same thing, but I've got
notebooks here, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got notes and days worth of content
prepared and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a lot of work that goes into
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for everyone to reach out and say,
Hey, we love the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throwing down on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that means a ton to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm grateful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to express gratitude as clearly
as possible for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember when you were talking about the
idea of doing it and how excited you were
[SPEAKER_04]: about like doing this concept and sharing
cannabis news and just grow tips and
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever you could just knowledge and your
love for the plant and industry and
[SPEAKER_04]: patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was awesome to see that from the
beginning and to have you still here with
[SPEAKER_04]: the same passion and love for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even more so have developed it into a
semi comedy podcast as well, and have made
[SPEAKER_04]: it a super fun time, along with getting
all of the information across and sharing
[SPEAKER_04]: the lives of your friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: And fellow cannabis industry people,
which is amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're spreading a lot more than yourself,
which is awesome because a lot of people
[SPEAKER_04]: just kind of get their self and their idea
out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you do a lot more than that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You speak for most of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was another show that I caught
advertising.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you wrote them an email and said,
I have spider mites, they'd say,
[SPEAKER_01]: buy this product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you would hear him talk about that
product through the entire episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I felt that that was kind of shitty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I do advertise things you guys,
but you notice I've got two advertisers on
[SPEAKER_01]: this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: You haven't heard anything about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're the one at the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll hear one later, two brief
advertisements.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to bombard you with them the
whole show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's people that want to support me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want their product known.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to crush you with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to put out, like Kev said,
I try to put out a genuine show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't keep shit back if I wanted to,
I don't think.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just come out and express myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's hilarious that people
have started saying that my show has got a
[SPEAKER_01]: touch of comedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that wasn't what I intended at all
when I started this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was to spread information and knowledge
and what's happening within the industry
[SPEAKER_04]: so people could experience it and
understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first hundred episodes are me reading
a script.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to make any mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew the magnitude of my advice to
people because they trust me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going out there saying, I'm the guy to
listen to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I better get it fucking right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to make however many people
listen to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that, I mean,
it wasn't, it wasn't there as much in the
[SPEAKER_03]: beginning, but there was still a good
piece, part of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's grown to be a bigger part of the
show over the years, but like it's highly
[SPEAKER_03]: educational, but it doesn't feel like
school or class.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't feel like you're sitting there
trying to learn stuff, but you learn a
[SPEAKER_04]: whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I wasn't a good student because
school was like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had a few teachers that knew that
about me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the good teachers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Teachers that are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause all three of us in this room are bad
fucking students.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're fucking, Mike's a Genco kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Kevin's a tattoo kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fucking Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we were, we were the kids that were
sneaking off getting high together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all went to different schools at
different times, but if we knew each
[SPEAKER_01]: other, you would have been suspended for
smoking weed together all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were, we were bad students.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we had good teachers, I would have gone
to school more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a few teachers, a band teacher that
saved my whole school fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without him, I would have quit going to
school.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, man, you need, you have to be
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to fuck your life up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause he knew that I would just show up
baked for that class.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he'd be like, I'll give you five band
classes a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to be in like jazz band,
orchestra, concert band, marching band,
[SPEAKER_01]: recess band, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a class this period,
but just be here, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, good teachers make a huge
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make it easy for people to learn.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a guy for me that wasn't really
directly my teacher, but he was a
[SPEAKER_04]: professor at one time.
[SPEAKER_04]: You, I think, you know, I'm Ray Greeson.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I know Ray, hippie Ray,
rainbow Ray.
[SPEAKER_04]: He did a lot for me in my young childhood
and all the way through my life as far as
[SPEAKER_04]: education wise and how much I am into the
sciences and math and how I can understand
[SPEAKER_04]: it and everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: He did a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did he ever kick your ass at chess?
[SPEAKER_03]: A real big sheepish grid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Play him once.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even get to move.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, damn, how did you, like,
I'm embarrassed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: My grandpa taught me to play chess and Ray
would have just destroyed my Gramps and I
[SPEAKER_01]: have nothing but respect for my Gramps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's embarrassing how good he is.
[SPEAKER_04]: He makes lunar calendars every year under
the name Pueblo fish.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if anybody runs across that name or
whatever, Ray Greeson, he's a super cool
[SPEAKER_04]: dude to hang out with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk to him.
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll, he'll talk to you about whatever
you want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he still does.
[SPEAKER_01]: He works all winter on the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes and follows the rainbow family.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes to all the rainbow gatherings.
[SPEAKER_04]: He does some traveling and stuff like that
in the summer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he comes usually back around this
area in the winter time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it'd be cool to run into him.
[SPEAKER_04]: He usually, I'm on his mailing list for
the lunar calendar.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I should be getting that at some point.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a little spiral calendar.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the most Pueblo story I've heard
in a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember what I was talking about
earlier when I was talking about all my
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff sounded scripted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to write shit out, like,
because I didn't want to screw anybody up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were word for word.
[SPEAKER_03]: You used to sit here and research
different topics.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd like, I want to write a show on
blank.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know enough about it to do a show.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'd still spend two weeks
researching everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm confident enough now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm so confident that I've gotten
300 episodes, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can sit here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could tell you about anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not shy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you everything you want to know
about my life now on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it because it gives me,
I said accountability earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't, I can't talk shit now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to rethink everything I'm about to
say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've said things that I've exaggerated and
be like, no, wait, wait, wait,
[SPEAKER_01]: I might be wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like, maybe I'm wrong on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'm exaggerating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I don't remember that story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to like think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'm like, I'm being recorded.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to even fucking, I have to
get the details right, right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it does something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also makes me a better speaker and
a better communicator, but I've gotten
[SPEAKER_01]: really comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to give a shout out to somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you listen to this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever shit fell apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is our friendship, our podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went separate ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got no animosity to you or for you
against you, with you, whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: however animosity works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any of it toward you.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a podcast with a guy named Wade
Ridley.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called seven one nine, the blocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was hired, I guess, to be the producer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was supposed to be the producer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was supposed to sit here and run the
microphones and keep the show working and
[SPEAKER_01]: host a place for the podcast to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a big ass mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't be quiet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Wade likes my opinions and we didn't
have a guest one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was just him and I, and I would talk
a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I was his lease.
[SPEAKER_01]: I at, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Wade and I did approximately 75
episodes of the seven one nine,
[SPEAKER_01]: the blocks podcast together.
[SPEAKER_01]: He kind of taught me sort of how to
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: He let me embarrass myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He let me embarrass myself on a few of his
shows before I had my own.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Wade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro, we're cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ever see me, high five me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a dab for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to say the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't talked to you for a minute,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're listening, dude,
like it would be cool to reconnect and see
[SPEAKER_04]: what's up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know exactly what happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: I probably have a good idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a shit head.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but I mean, it would be cool to link
back up with you, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were a big part of my life and did
quite a few things that were pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: awesome for me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hope you're doing well, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Wade Ridley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got me podcasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also shout out to John Doe radio.
[SPEAKER_01]: What up, Tim Martin?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was, oh dang.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wade was the other dude for smoking weed
for the news, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I thought.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody has smoked weed on the news with.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't going to go that far into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, if you, here's a brief history
lesson then since Mike just linked all of
[SPEAKER_01]: that together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brief history lesson.
[SPEAKER_03]: That shit was on the news like a month
ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's in my head.
Damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was on seven one nine, the blocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin brought, so I went to high school
with, not Wade, but I was in the same,
[SPEAKER_01]: I drank beer with the same people as Wade.
[SPEAKER_01]: He worked at a bar that I used to go to.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the same age.
[SPEAKER_01]: He worked at Phil's.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to go to Phil's.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd get shit faced.
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew all the same people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got along, but never like hung out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: We all like, we're, we're friends with
Matt Tapia and Carl Grutt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we had so many common links.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we had nothing against each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd high five as we walked by,
but we didn't, he'd never been to my house
[SPEAKER_01]: and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then Kev was like, Hey man, I've been
hanging out with Wade Ridley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, man, come in, bring him to
the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like just fucking bring him by.
[SPEAKER_01]: He seems like a cool guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always liked his vibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've always gotten along.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Wade and I started hanging out and Wade
and I loved, hated each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we agreed, disagreed on so much shit,
but we were adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we could have great disagreement
conversations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Wade loves to play devil's advocate,
just like I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would both just troll each other and
it would get hot down in the basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd have to come up here and smoke dabs
and calm down and be like, bro,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's, we can't have this conversation on
the couch down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to go in a bigger space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And get like fresh air and be a little
further apart from each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause this is getting weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like sometimes we'd want to punch each
other, but we'd be like, man, this is
[SPEAKER_01]: good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what we're asking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started a podcast together.
[SPEAKER_01]: He started a podcast and I was like,
that needs love, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, what would you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I've got all this gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would plug all this gear in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, oh, like he lit up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we started the podcast and then,
uh, fucking we're doing a lot of podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would talk about cannabis occasionally
and he would feel like, he would give me
[SPEAKER_01]: this vibe of that's not what I want to be
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he would kind of rush me through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then cannabis became recreational
legal in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was the first person to purchase
recreational cannabis in Pueblo,
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado at the greener side on the South
side at STEM beach.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's now called doctor's orders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it was the greener side and my buddy
Hank used to own it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the first person to shop there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Wade and I, I got to be on the news
for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Wade came here after, so I went back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every news station in Colorado picked a
dispensary kind of at random to do what
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff did the day marijuana first became
legal in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like every, every news channel had they're
the first customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and it was cool that you were the one
down here for, I don't know what,
[SPEAKER_03]: KOA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's KOA five and 30.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Michelle San Miguel was a reporter
that, uh, helped me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I met up with Michelle right after I
walk out and then we talked.
[SPEAKER_01]: She interviews me and then I come home and
I call Wade and I was like, where are you
[SPEAKER_01]: bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: We should record about this and put it on
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he came over here and he goes,
I got a better idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we drove back to the greener side
and Michelle San Miguel was still there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she came up to me and she said,
Hey, do you have any of the weed you
[SPEAKER_01]: bought earlier?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, no, it's at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: She goes, we want to watch people smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, Oh, it's illegal to smoke
out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Mike and I kind of looked at each
other and Mike is Mike's a little more
[SPEAKER_01]: level headed than myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's a little, a borer of a different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thinker.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got caught up in the spirit of the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a rebel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll cowboy the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I, I'm down to break the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, obviously.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I looked at Mike, it was an insane
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there was a dude driving by throwing
weed and plants at people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just passing a truck bed full of four by
four plants and he'd pull up and honk in
[SPEAKER_03]: half the line would run up to his truck
and come back like, what do I do now?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then run their plant to their car and
then try to reform a quarter mile long
[SPEAKER_03]: line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get as best they could from memory.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were certainly smoking bowls and
joints in that line and security guards
[SPEAKER_01]: were walking by going, please put that out
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just walk away.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just, they'd have to do their job and
tell you not to, but they didn't do shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were helicopters overhead getting
footage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a chaotic day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Michelle San Miguel was like,
can we film you guys smoking somewhere?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I looked at Mike and Mike just gave me
the, yeah, dude, I don't see why not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was looking for guidance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, tell me why we can't go smoke weed
at my house and let the news film it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had no reason why not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, yeah, my house here's my
address.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then she's like, we'll give you like
an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be there in an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we drove here and everybody put on an
irie genetics t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like everybody got all decked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and then we cleaned up the table and
put some props on the table, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like put the right products in the right
places and did what we need to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the news came here and filmed us,
filmed me taking a big old dab on the news
[SPEAKER_01]: and filmed Mike smoking a joint and filmed
filthy Wade and his filthy mustache
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking a joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got a scene that they like a me
hitting a pipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the scene of you hitting a dab,
apparently they love.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I used to run into that reporter at
city council and she would bring it up at
[SPEAKER_03]: least three or four times a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, uh, she moved away and got
assigned to another area, but she was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime she had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, headed anytime she had cannabis
related questions, she would just call me
[SPEAKER_01]: and she's like, Hey, I need to interview
somebody about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who would you send me to?
[SPEAKER_01]: And half the time I'd be like,
Oh, that's a Mike thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just go straight to Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't even call me about these types of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's Mike's number.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she would text me, hi, I've already
taught or I already texted Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, this is a you question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then she hit me with her question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a lot of the political stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wave right over to Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, uh, Michelle San Miguel comes
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, that ends up on the news.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is part of the ABC world news or
something that they can play.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they can play it whenever it's been
played in Australia.
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly don't care enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the major news organizations,
they own it and they play it on their shit
[SPEAKER_01]: all the time when they talk about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Mike and Wade and I are seen worldwide.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're B-roll now.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Wade and I talked about that a lot on
the podcast on the seven one nine,
[SPEAKER_01]: the blocks podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that kind of before Wade was like,
nobody wants to hear about weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody wants to hear about weed,
but now that it was legal and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: revolutionizing revolution, it was a
revolutionary topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can dig myself out of holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it was a huge topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wade would give me some space on the
podcast to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, he got bored with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't want me to talk about it as
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then his relationship and I and the
podcast, he kind of quit doing that
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast and it kind of fizzled and he
moved to Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I started doing my own show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, we had both shows at the same
time and he didn't want to do my segment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just started doing a whole weed show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of how we came to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So without Wade, I don't know that I would
be doing a cannabis podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had talked about it there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there was enough bad information
and that was pissing you off at the time
[SPEAKER_03]: to the degree that was worthy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember when you were, you were
outlining a book for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was no chance of me putting that
on a book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I've got ADD and it changes so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was getting ready to be like,
dude, I'll help you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll ghost write that fucker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like just tell me what to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would go to Spencer and Maddie's house
all the time, the garden of Weeden crew
[SPEAKER_01]: and, uh, Spence, they would invite me over
and then we'd get high as shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't want to go home cause I
didn't be here at home alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Maddie and Spence and the dogs were
there, but Spence would get high and want
[SPEAKER_01]: to go play with his plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Maddie would just be sitting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they'd have other people come
over and this guy, Nick kept coming over
[SPEAKER_01]: and asking me and Maddie apologized.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has so many questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's making my brain spin.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's making me think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love that about the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me a better grower, but Nick kept
asking questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Nick left and Travis came over
and asked the same fucking questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Maddie's like, God, I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same fucking question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to start recording this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and then I was like, no,
wait, I'm really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was kind of a smart ass joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I'm just going to put my phone
out and just record it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next time somebody asks,
I'm going to hit play.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was like, no, wait, I've got a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I can just go do a podcast and that's
kind of what a lot of what's started it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the book idea, and you're right,
people pissing me off on the forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw people telling people to use coffee
grounds to fix nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a bunch of conversations of bad
grow information.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I'd bring up the bad dab information
and concentrate information that was going
[SPEAKER_04]: on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you were like, dude, we need to do
something about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because that was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't let the three people who were
fronting for the entire community continue
[SPEAKER_03]: to do that shit with other voices
alongside them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's sort of how this podcast started
at number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ended up to three hundred.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to drop in the clip that goes,
this is Sparta right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: The the accountability piece, like.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you told me how many downloads you
got in February about shit, I was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: cool, I think I've done my last show for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kept refreshing that page over and over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that real?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of zeros.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do other social media and some of what I
do kicks you out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Viewer metric.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never saw this show reaching that many
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe you stuck with it this
long.
Like.
[SPEAKER_01]: My when I first started, I was like,
I'd like to get a hundred episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I hit a hundred, I was like,
well, that's easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just getting good at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt comfortable now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like around seventy five, I think seventy
three, sixty three ish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whichever the there's a perpetual grow and
there's a dry and cure episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I'm fucking podcasting here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thirty six.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had to look it up so many times.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was getting a rhythm then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I got the new intro song and
then I'm going to write a name down just
[SPEAKER_01]: because I have to give a shout out to
somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to interrupt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even in those early was a lot of amazing
shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, who made me a huge, hugely
better podcaster.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, if you're trying to start a
podcast and this is really random,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're trying to start a podcast,
if you're trying to improve your podcast,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you want to know more about podcasting,
there is a guy named Cliff Ravenscraft.
[SPEAKER_03]: The podcast dancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is known as the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: The podcast dancer, man, he's changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's rebranded himself.
[SPEAKER_03]: He used to make me listen to his shows
when we were driving places far.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, that guy taught me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't get it the first two shows,
but by the third one, I was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, now I fucking get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can hear it in the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it made me a better podcaster.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made me a better producer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made me a better social media manager.
[SPEAKER_01]: It improved.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just made me the way that Cliff
Ravenscraft.
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't the ad he told you you would
hear later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check out Cliff Ravenscraft.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: He, he just, he taught me a different way
of thinking and different ways of
[SPEAKER_01]: approaching things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just opens up your eyes and it's free.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much free content.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got so much paid content.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never paid for any of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've learned a ton.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could only imagine what I'd get for the
paid content, but podcast answer,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cliff Ravenscraft is the podcast answer,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll teach you so much shit about
podcasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see where I got a lot of my ideas
and inspiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: I owe him a huge shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that he'll ever listen to
this, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to mention him because without
that dude, this wouldn't be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gratitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what I've got written down.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest word on my page is gratitude
and nacho theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two biggest things.
[SPEAKER_03]: That nacho theory scares me.
[SPEAKER_01]: My throat's dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, one of you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about drinking dab time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, let's ramble about
something and then get some dabs going.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been going for a little bit here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can get silly again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took us a minute to get back on earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a favorite show you've been
on, Kev?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or a favorite podcast moment?
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, I couldn't tell you at the moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I asked when we were talking about who was
on the first episode, I got thinking about
[SPEAKER_03]: why I knew that offhand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I recently went back and listened to a
couple of throwbacks and just started with
[SPEAKER_03]: number one again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of feel like a bag of dicks for not
remembering that you weren't on number
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always here.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I've been on more episodes than any
other guest by a mile.
[SPEAKER_03]: 44 is preoccupied.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I think I really liked the first one
because it was just, it was really just
[SPEAKER_04]: informational.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one where you guys pretend to be
excited about having been at the cup when
[SPEAKER_03]: the cup was just a brutal experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a minute where you're like,
so we're going to talk about the cup next
[SPEAKER_03]: week.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it goes into the next show and
you're like, so we were at the cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big events are challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun, but they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've invented the way to do things so
much in Colorado, but we haven't got the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis consumption friendly event down
to an ABCD.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had it figured out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We fucked it all up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the first few events we nailed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we got legalities, excuse me on
burping, we got legalities involved and it
[SPEAKER_01]: ruined everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but that has to happen at some
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't throw a regular party for more
than eight people.
[SPEAKER_01]: My thing is those events have,
I don't know how many people went.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember the cannabis, the last cannabis
cup at the ex toe, the small place where
[SPEAKER_01]: that traffic jam of people happened where
you couldn't walk anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were just stuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were like physically stuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that the one that got reamed because
of the fucking huge trash the next year?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exactly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those events are challenging because you
have to park three miles away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you got to park and then walk with all
of your gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got, and I'm not trying to sound like
a bitch, but you've got your product that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're, whatever you're vending,
you've got your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you've got your dab rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got whatever else you're bringing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got a hat, sunglasses,
a fucking jacket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you got layers of clothing because
it's Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a backpack.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just challenging to get from the car
to the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's so many people,
you got to stand in line forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the events are super crowded.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's challenging because Kevin
and I have a different approach to the
[SPEAKER_01]: events than most consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We aren't your average consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're there to see other industry folk and
into consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: This sounds egotistical and it's weird for
me to even think about it this way,
[SPEAKER_01]: but consumers are there to see us a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to come talk to Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love the social interaction,
but after from fucking noon to eight at
[SPEAKER_01]: night, your voice starts to sound like
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, will you shut up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I want to check my text messages and
eat a sandwich.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they throw a big concert or
whatever that never sounds worth a shit
[SPEAKER_04]: and never ends.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time I see a cannabis themed concert
and like, I'm a fan of some of the bands
[SPEAKER_03]: that always do them, but I see the lineup
and I'm like, the fuck, why?
[SPEAKER_01]: And these mid nineties hip hop bands most
of the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's already 420.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't we just have some good music?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're getting better.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like St. Patty's Day where
everything needs to be green.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't been to an event in years,
dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't been to any of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting bigger name, better acts
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's another event that's actually
booking top acts that are current right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to our friends at the Chalice
Festival.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't pay me to say any of that,
but Chalice is revolutionizing cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: festivals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chalice is doing it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Dougie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dougie's doing everything right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care if you love or hate Hitman
Glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that Dougie does shit well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Dougie's a good business man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love him or fucking hate him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's killing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like taking Hitman.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a dab right here of this Gorilla
Glue number four, the Ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Taking one of the islands, huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just so gorgeous, folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I wish I could take some pictures of
it, but I'm going to just smoke it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's probably the weed talking,
but you know in the movie where they do
[SPEAKER_03]: like the cool 3D map of the fucking island
that they're going to go to, that's kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of what it looks like in the jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's this beautiful sea of fucking
turps and then there's just these fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: gorgeous little island chain of icebergs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Icebergs, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Little icebergs in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I was thinking more like full of life
rather than sink your ship, but both are
[SPEAKER_03]: accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit of both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the way I do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and they're more ice than green.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you also describe these as piss
yellow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when you said, I'm trying to avoid
that, Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you said ice, I get so nervous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's around people that don't know what
dabs are because they got to be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: what is he fucking doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to hit this on camera or in
non-heavy consumption company,
[SPEAKER_03]: you really need a hat with giant bold
white lettering on it that says this isn't
[SPEAKER_03]: crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, can you tell them about Patreon
while I take a dab?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you capable?
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff has a Patreon account.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should hit it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell them what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patreon.com slash Grow From Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell them what Patreon is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Patreon.com slash Grow From Your Heart is
a way for the listeners to help contribute
[SPEAKER_03]: to the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can contribute any amount of money to
the show that you like from a penny to a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of pennies.
[SPEAKER_03]: We encourage people to donate $4.20 to any
cannabis related anything just to let them
[SPEAKER_03]: know kind of which community you're coming
from.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you wanted to help cover some of
the costs and expenses of the show,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we're not talking about the hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about microphone covers and
earphone cables and that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can hop on Patreon and help Jeff out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he's trying to save it for a
MacBook, people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a whole lot of Patreon
contributions.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the Patreon community has been killing
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The community has just been absolutely
wonderful lately.
[SPEAKER_03]: So keep the love coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we thank you very, very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was good, Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty good for ad limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, if you go to Patreon.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was on the fucking spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never done an ad before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you nailed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I just did you right on the
spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna take a dab now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all stressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all stressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, if you go to Patreon.com slash
Grow From Your Heart, I've made promises.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me, I swallowed and said I've made
promises at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've made promises.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you contribute certain amounts,
I have promised to do certain things for
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I've made specific goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not just begging for money with no
goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put it up there clearly what I'm gonna
do with the finances.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you'd like to help out, I would
appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, GrowFromYourHeart.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I got you a dab, Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got me like four dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patreon.com slash Grow From Your Heart is
what I was trying to say, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the love and support.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to everybody who's helped me out.

[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't, just keep listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your listens mean the world to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're supporting cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're supporting cannabis legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're supporting our efforts.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can't contribute and you want us to
support us more than just listening,
[SPEAKER_03]: tell a friend or 17.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell all your friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just blab about the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Retweet it, share it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, because I'm off on a ramble
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just took a big old dab of some Gorilla
Glue.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just so impressed with where the
show's gone now.
[SPEAKER_01]: He kind of at the bottom of the nail a
little better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the floor meets the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right in that corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just trying to clean off a layer of
soap, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna taste good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Skywise.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did I give you?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the taffy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the LA affy and the tangy,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just dabbed the Gorilla Glue number
four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of it came out of my nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of burns, but I feel like I get so
high when it comes out of my nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it burns.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it burns.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something good and bad about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This would be a good time to read that ad
I was talking about, because it feels like
[SPEAKER_01]: we've got some dead space in the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry about all the coughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, should I just turn down your mic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember what number you are?
[SPEAKER_01]: Three.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mic has turned down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kev, you're still live, so don't say
anything too dumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try not to.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know with this kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check this out, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: This podcast is proudly brought to you by
our friends at PL Grow Systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: PL Grow Systems, putting you in control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out this read they gave me,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking love this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know their audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know who I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wrote this, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is straight up from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've just taken a nice, fat dab and you
get that burning desire to check on your
[SPEAKER_01]: grow room, but you're too stoned to move.
[SPEAKER_01]: P&L Grow Systems, the minder, lets you
check on your grow room environment from
[SPEAKER_01]: right there on the couch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simply log in and get the information you
need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's no exaggeration, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: P&L, PL Grow Systems sent me a unit to set
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their website is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You open this package, you go to their
website, you sign up, you create an
[SPEAKER_01]: account, you register your device,
you put your device in the grow room,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it will tell you live readings of your
temperature and humidity and more,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can log in anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other devices like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not gonna bash other products.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other devices like this that
I've talked about that I've used and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're great, but you can't log in from
anywhere and view them.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the PL Grow Systems unit,
I can be over at Kev's house dabbing on
[SPEAKER_01]: the couch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can be up at Liberty Point eating lunch,
and I can log in and I can see what's
[SPEAKER_01]: going on in my grow in real time,
which for a guy with OCD like me,
[SPEAKER_01]: for a guy that loves his garden like me,
it's really helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think their ad is great because it's
accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many times Mike's getting up to just
leave?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's like, fuck this, I'm so high,
I'm going home.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many times have you been somewhere and
you're like, I kinda wanna hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, let's get real.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many times have you been hanging out
with a fine ass girl?
[SPEAKER_01]: She's fucking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, oh tonight might be the
goddamn night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can look at the temps and the
humidity and you can make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: everything's cool in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check the moisture sensor, make sure the
plants are moist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if everything's cool, you can probably
hang out for a little longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can relax and enjoy yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you don't have a PL Grow System
unit, you can't fucking log in and check
[SPEAKER_01]: it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna have to go home.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be freaking out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing getting wet tonight are the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good fucking ad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to our friends at PL Grow
Systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I support them, they support me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should support them as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys for the support.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't do any more ads in this episode,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But make sure you check it out,
PNL Grow Systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have their website right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to get my iPad to light up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was really far away, so I had to
reach for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their website is plgrow.systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them know that Rasta Jeff sent you,
please.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, no more ads, you guys,
I promise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I promise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kev, you're awful quiet over there,
dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's not bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's not bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're fun ads.
[SPEAKER_04]: I watch YouTube videos all the time,
and you can't get through five minutes
[SPEAKER_04]: without getting an ad.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of retarded.
[SPEAKER_04]: YouTube kind of decides where they throw
the ads at you, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, but it's all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's frustrating.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I hate, though, is I watch fish
videos at work, because I'll just put on
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube and go type in fish and then just
let it play fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And dude, fish plays like 15 minute songs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And about eight minutes is where you get
like, yeah, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll go, you'll be like,
been away this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, what did what just
happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a tide commercial with new tide
pods.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, no, fuck your tide pods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get out of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happens a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they play on the reggae channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: They put McDonald's commercials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, that's poorly aimed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Rasta's aren't going to go eat
McDonald's.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's highly unlikely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should put a vitamin cottage or a
Sprouts commercial on here or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might have got me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's whoever pays, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I guess you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Mike's back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I walk back into just a podcast,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: How was your day?
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting better every minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the right approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did everybody get a good dad?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine came out of my nose and I can still
feel it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So coughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kev, did you get snowing over there?
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't gotten another dab yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just because I've just been
chilling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you need a dab of Skywalker or are you
just being patient over there?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just being patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you a Skywalker dab if you're
sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll take a Skywalker dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't really decide what I was going
to dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that the hardest part of life?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes not in a hurry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first world problems, that Colorado
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this one's going to be a combo because
we finished off this Skywalker.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get a Skywalker Taffy,
a Scaffy dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's sounds worse than it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like jealousy to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, you want another big dab?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you one, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ready?
[SPEAKER_01]: Step up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Need a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lungs are still fluttering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're still sweating like actively.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sweating and I haven't even dabbed
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's just thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's sweating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's drool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like, oh shit, I'm going to dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's drool, Kev.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just drooling for the coming dab.
All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a little Taffy, a little Skywalker.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got you a torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a real pretty rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to our friend Camp Bulls Glass
with the dope rig.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like the banger.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like three times as thick as anything
I've owned.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a super thick version.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go to the store and see the super
thick one, that's the one Kev's got.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they just had the regular one the
last two times I was shopping,
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's rare to find these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get yourself a bubble cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have been digging on the core
reactor banger.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not hot enough for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take too big of a dab for it,
I feel like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know people are going to say,
that's bullshit, but I want my dabs hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for cool dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not designed for a hot dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do cool dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like it's for cool dabs and a
large supply.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of butane.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're supposed to heat this bottom part
to keep that big piece in there hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as soon as your dab hits it,
it really cools it off super quickly when
[SPEAKER_01]: you put a puddle in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put a big, big, big dabs lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dab size has just been increasing
lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Kev's over there heating the nail until
it's going to reshape itself, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: You good, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just cleaning it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Burning off that muck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, got to do that every now and then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it a good clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make that turp taste good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then you let it cool down.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, go in right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hot and hurty.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three, two, one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red means go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red means go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Red never means go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, you asked Kevin what his favorite
moment on the podcast was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any favorite moments of the
podcast?
[SPEAKER_03]: Episode 100 is a serious standout.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who was here for that one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that Garden of Weed in and yourself?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was everybody that you could get here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This place was packed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sloppy and Joe were sitting over there in
the corner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dry dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dry dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They took a dab out of the email with no
water in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Sloppy's like, you trying to kill me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Sloppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sloppy went from... I remember when Sloppy
used to rap in the basement at the Garden
[SPEAKER_01]: of Weed in house, in the Garden of Weed
and getting weeded.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now Sloppy is legit on tour with ICP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, Sloppy came a long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slop's on tour with ICP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, go check out Shampoo Sloppy or
something similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sloppy 919.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dead God.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all Sloppy's brand and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't keep up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to sound like an old guy right
now, but the youngsters change their names
[SPEAKER_01]: and their handles and their rap names so
quickly that... We had to pick one and own
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think... He's a youngster and it's
been an evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to watch him evolve from one
version of Slop to the next, to what he's
[SPEAKER_01]: become now, which has been a blessing to
watch one of your friends go from rapping
[SPEAKER_01]: in the basement at Spence and Maddie's.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember when Maddie was like,
my buddy Sloppy's moving out here in a
[SPEAKER_01]: little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to like him.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys will get along.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Sloppy came and I was like,
this guy is fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I totally get along with Sloppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, he's down as shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he's like, I'm a rapper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, everybody's a rapper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he started rapping and putting
out beats.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, that dude's got it going
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: He can actually do some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he tried this new thing and then
I was like, ah, it's coming together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he started putting out videos and
I was like, it's coming even more
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one day he's like, guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dog going on tour with ICP and all these
other names that I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, I recognize ICP and I was
like, you're doing something, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a guy in his crew that wears a
giant foot or giant toe costume that's
[SPEAKER_01]: getting real fancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's famous also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Sloppy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck, you just made me feel old.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we are old, Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the same time, I'm essentially smoking
future weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a weird dichotomy here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great time to be alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of our buddies, Rob, was like,
are you smoking those weird crystals?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I sure as shit am,
Rob.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck yeah, we are, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on deck for tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: The crystals are, it's a different high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like 90 something percent THC and it
really hits you quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can mess up a good podcast real fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't soured dieseled in a while and
this is a new gram, honestly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not super familiar with the ride on
this particular gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't say how much is which,
but I feel like we need a project.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike smoked himself into a do something
mode.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's like, oh, we should do
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I looked down and I'm like,
you're talking to a microphone right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We take some of that to work tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're making something done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: that was a good dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're fucking sweaty, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the Skywalker leftovers and the
taffy on top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's the batter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Garden of Weedon made that also.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to the crew at the Garden of
Weedon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The beads of sweat is gathered up under
for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I'll be all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys need more bottles of water,
let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a backup over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody needs anything, just raise your
hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll help you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that kind of show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a two water bottle kind of
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do that occasionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike covered Patreon, so that's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I covered the other ad that I talked
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did a good job, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was not at all prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it wasn't too ugly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So episode 100 was your favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else stand out for you?
[SPEAKER_03]: There were a number of grow episodes that
I remember anticipating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I knew they were going to get
recorded because you would tell me like,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, so and so is finally emailed me back.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to set up a show to it's going
to get recorded on Wednesday to it's going
[SPEAKER_03]: to drop on Monday to like furiously taking
notes because that was the step I was
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be doing in a month.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that kind of shit that I really
enjoyed in going back and listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to kind of relive some of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of fun on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've laughed a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had to stop recording.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my favorite times now that I'm
thinking about it, I smacked my elbow on
[SPEAKER_01]: this chair and I turned to get up to do
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I hit myself this way because I
was getting to get up and I hit my funny
[SPEAKER_01]: bone and I was still recording and I just
sat back down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, mother fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just hit my funny bone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just talked myself through it and I just
left the mic on and I put that in the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, that was kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some of my favorite moments or
mistakes I've made and dumb shit that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just like, I'm not even going to
edit that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just keep going because I've edited
some.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've stopped editing that crap out now
because I'm a human and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: stutter and stumble and say some dumb
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like to show that I'm kind of human
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it's too clean, it feels
overproduced.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I wanted that, I'd still have an AM
FM radio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd listen to Art Bell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that like the OG podcast?
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember you'd be driving home from a
concert late at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, not you, Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: You lived in Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to drive fucking two and a half
hours from Red Rocks back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only thing we didn't have
podcasting and shit back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm old.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I was on fish tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to travel around the country and go
see fish from place to place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had a tape deck or a radio in the
car.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you listen to all the tapes in
the car, you're like, just put on,
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's nighttime, if it's like 10,
11, 12 o'clock at night, cruise the AM
[SPEAKER_01]: channels and find George Norrie and Art
Bell and put on some coast to coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that was the OG podcast right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of where that shit kind of
got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got started.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never spent enough time on the road to
have to go to AM.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I just learned a new thing about you
that makes me see you differently.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would talk about aliens.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've listened to AM?
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't think there was that much
difference between your age and my age,
[SPEAKER_03]: but apparently it includes some AM
listening in our twenties.
[SPEAKER_01]: My brother Bradley got me addicted to a
coast to coast AM radio.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys talk about aliens and fucking
conspiracies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what does it to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd be driving.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can get this all across America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you can call in and talk to them and
contribute and they like egg you on with
[SPEAKER_01]: your conspiracy theories.
[SPEAKER_01]: They talk about ghosts and fucking.
[SPEAKER_03]: My trips, you could always cover with a
good catalog of tapes or maybe some books
[SPEAKER_03]: on tape.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: No AM.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did like 20 shows of widespread panic
tour in summer tour 2001.
[SPEAKER_01]: We needed something to listen to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought this was all the drugs,
but apparently there was plenty of AM.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine to mix the drugs and the AM
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's there was a stirring element.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Previously, and apparently it was AM talk
radio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen to fish all night and then AM
radio.
[SPEAKER_03]: God, it wasn't politics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am so ignorant to politics that it's
like semi embarrassing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, oh, I should have.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's literally all I know of AM talk
radio is that one family member used to
[SPEAKER_03]: love talk radio shows about politics on AM
radio near.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at this point in the world and at my
age, I should be way on top of politics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would get an F in a political
sciences class, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not alone.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd get a fucking A in Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm currently watching our city devolve
into a bait about a research study that
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the only person who's read,
but there's a lot of people trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: debate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've given up on trying to get like the
masses to do shit correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about bro science now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody cares what science says.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what bro science says.
[SPEAKER_03]: What it feels like or what you see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's everybody gets a trophy.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one who fucking like, that's what I
studied in college was like how this shit
[SPEAKER_03]: gets done and why it gets done and who
does it and what rules they follow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's what I studied.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so to see shit get butchered like
this, like I've kind of given up on
[SPEAKER_03]: humanity this week.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be back next week folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably let's turn this boat back around
before Mike has everybody committing a
[SPEAKER_01]: mass suicide on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get back to gratitude gratitude,
Mike gratitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I really, uh, shout out to all the
people that use that hashtag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it when you ramble hashtag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see those and I fucking love hashtag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just said hashtag too, but shout out
to all the people that support us on the
[SPEAKER_01]: social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is really funny guys to put out an
episode and then within hours to start
[SPEAKER_01]: getting comments about, Hey, that episode
taught me this or Hey, needed this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all that interaction, uh, the people
that like to just listen to us ramble,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple of people that said,
uh, I was depressed or bummed or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hearing you talk about whatever put me
in a better mood.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that is really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rescue in your garden, putting you in a
better mood.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm grateful for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I turned it back around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, you can't crash my gratitude ship.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't poke the bear.
[SPEAKER_01]: The look on his face.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I wish you could have seen his
face.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, fuck y'all crash this thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw four good E-brake levers in that
speech.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just gave, which I liked by the way,
and I agree with most of it, but there
[SPEAKER_03]: were a couple of points where I was like,
I'll turn this podcast right around and
[SPEAKER_03]: take you home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Young man.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can belly flop this.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take another dab, drink another Mountain
Dew, my friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's just, it's been a fun week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that's another thing I should say.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people tell me about how they
look forward to Monday because of my
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, people that have jobs they don't
enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you can give someone who has a
regular job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Monday can kick a person's ass Monday.
[SPEAKER_01]: It fucks us up and we love our job most of
the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Monday's so fucked up.
[SPEAKER_03]: When people have a fucked up Tuesday,
they describe it as having a second
[SPEAKER_03]: Monday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's how fucked up Mondays are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But have no fear because Rasta Jeff is
here to fix up your Monday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even being me, sometimes the podcast is
like, I will go to bed on Sunday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, man, fuck, I ain't ready for Monday,
but at least the show's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I walk into the office at work and Mike is
listening to my podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Upstairs in the office.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes he was on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It scares the trimmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I need to go back and listen to
what the fuck I said.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know how many listeners
happened to be listening the night that
[SPEAKER_03]: Oregon screwed up a bunch of their ID
checks the first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't repeat what I said, but it wasn't
my proudest moment on air.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not edit that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might've told you I was gonna.
[SPEAKER_03]: You told me you were gonna.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I listened like a month later and
I was like, motherfuck, that's why people
[SPEAKER_03]: have been sending me weird tweets.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now those make sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now, like, I usually listen to the
show and I follow the top extreme.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if it's one I'm really looking forward
to, I make sure to listen to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I wanted, I damn sure listen
because sometimes we get really high and I
[SPEAKER_03]: say some silly shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of getting high and saying some
silly shit, shout out to Bo Nellis.
[SPEAKER_01]: What up, Bo?
[SPEAKER_01]: We miss you, Bo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a show going.
[SPEAKER_01]: We miss you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
We do.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss your Twitter interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, if you wanna hang out with us
more, if you like listening to the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast, you can find me on Instagram
Live.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been on Instagram Live a lot lately.
Those live feeds are awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see what I'm dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can throw out questions and I will
answer them right there on the Instagram
[SPEAKER_01]: Live.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually put, episode number 299 was a
chunk of Instagram Live clips put
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you enjoyed that, let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put out more of that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: The throwback Thursday episodes are gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, there's no need to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I threw them all back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I caught us all up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's up on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just gonna be straight up normal
episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna try to do two a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna do Thursday quickies and
Monday full length episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then occasionally I'm gonna put out
those Instagram videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do plan on bringing you more content.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, we're at 300.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no plans of stopping.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reason to stop.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're finding a better gear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just keep getting better at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are listening more.
[SPEAKER_01]: The interactions are going crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna go to 500 now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna go to a thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Joe Rogan's one of the only
podcasts that I listen to that's made it
[SPEAKER_01]: to a thousand episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You qualify that with that you listen to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's only a few in my favorites list
that have a number more than a couple
[SPEAKER_03]: hundred.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rogan's like at almost 1,100 now,
which is... Kevin Smith's got like 40
[SPEAKER_03]: podcasts and I listened to a couple of
them and some of them went around for
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rogan does three shows a week on average.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how he does it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking three hours long because he gets
fucked up on caveman coffee and alpha
[SPEAKER_01]: brain and just fucking... And the topics
are amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He brings on the coolest fucking people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of his shows have been really,
really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I end up watching for the guest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you walk through the trim room at work,
that's the number one agreed upon comedian
[SPEAKER_01]: and podcast is Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_03]: We kind of hit a spot where we were tired
of giving each other shit over the music.
[SPEAKER_03]: Music choice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they've been doing just... It's
sort of like Pandora for comedy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you only get three to six minutes per
artist.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's never like a long bit or the first
half of their DVD or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just one or two bits.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just fucking great.
[SPEAKER_03]: That day flies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love walking in and trying... Being a
comedy nerd, I pride myself in being a
[SPEAKER_01]: comedy nerd.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love to walk in mid bit if I'm passing
through because it's on the way to the
[SPEAKER_01]: men's room or the front door.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm passing through the trim crew,
I'll stop and be like, who is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's Mitch Hedberg live at this
place, 1992 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what Hedberg did,
but I can fucking... I can tell you,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, that's Chappelle off of this recording
or that's Rogan off the Rocky Mountain
[SPEAKER_01]: High recording.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to name them or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the trimmers always laugh at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to make a note in GarageBank because
I just saw something that I don't like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just got to make an adjustment.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were listening to a lot of newer R&B
and rap and I don't know any of that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when they switched to comedy,
I was like, oh, fuck, this is Bill Burr
[SPEAKER_03]: forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bill Burr forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they all looked at me like,
how the fuck do you... It was a fun little
[SPEAKER_03]: change up this week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Bill Burr is a savage.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, my throat's starting
to burn out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys want to keep going or you want
to take some dabs and start wrapping it
[SPEAKER_01]: up?
[SPEAKER_01]: How's everybody doing on time?
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the above.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got plenty of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm down to keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do some editing and make this podcast
not as rambly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I say that as I check my phone and see if
it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to press pause real quick and
make a correction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And garage band just while I'm thinking
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll keep going here.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, guys, we are back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are well medicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are well hydrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a big fat dab of the taffy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The taffy that ruined Kevin's life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some of that on the dabber here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to heat up this nail and take a
fat dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little ruined to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took a little break to get a drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took a break to fix a technical issue
with the computer and the mic here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are back on track.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we took a break, I remembered that I
wanted to talk about the strain episodes
[SPEAKER_01]: that we've been doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was mentioning how much fun I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt that it would be very egotistical
to go online and do a podcast about
[SPEAKER_01]: something that I bred and hype up my own
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That felt kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once I did it, everybody responded so
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are a lot of fun, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a lot of fun doing those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So look forward to more of the strain
report episodes coming from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to do them too frequently
because I'll run out of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are only so many to do, but maybe as
I create more, I can try to catch up and
[SPEAKER_01]: do backlogs and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, the strain report.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those have been a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, I'm going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will you ramble for me?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying.
[SPEAKER_03]: What strain report's coming next?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do we got to look forward to?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just did one, so I haven't planned the
next one yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kev, what are you looking for with the
podcast over the next 100 episodes?
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably just a continuation of what he's
been doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if there's really much to add
because I'm not really a grower per se.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know where it needs to go from
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what he's doing is spot on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like letting... The thing I'm hoping to
see is more guests.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I'm alone there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't mean more me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just more people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to find a better way to do guests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we need a studio that's better
located.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, being in Pueblo is rough.
[SPEAKER_03]: You tell people Pueblo and they take two
steps back and check for their wallet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting them to come down here like,
no, I'm coming to this private
[SPEAKER_03]: neighborhood here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can go to places.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just I'm consumed by the current
project we're working on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's got me overloaded.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes I'm not sure when I'm going
to get to record.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've just got to... Everybody I want
you to get on the show, that's also true
[SPEAKER_03]: for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know why it is like it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was going to say I just like letting
the show kind of evolve.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have plans and ideas, but it's doing
its thing perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to take too many sponsors so
you won't get too many ads.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll always support the Helidank seed
company or who the vendors are because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's kind of a symbiotic relationship
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always plan to share what I'm smoking
on, stay honest, keep the people up to
[SPEAKER_01]: date.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing I've noticed is in early
episodes, I had different ideas on some
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've said, do follow your feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not follow your feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do follow your feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, now do follow your feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now don't... Like I've changed my opinion
and idea and I'm glad that people have
[SPEAKER_01]: still respected me because I've changed my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to keep doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to keep giving the most updated
advice that I can give when I learn more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to try to not be too
prideful and too egotistical to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, I've changed my idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this is the way I would do it now
because there are things I'm doing way
[SPEAKER_01]: differently now than I have ever done
before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a big part of the reason I
think the level of grower that you are is
[SPEAKER_03]: because you didn't learn away and then
stick to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I watched so many people fall into that
rut, sort of like it was a cookie recipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they would struggle with
different genetics because they didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: like to follow the recipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just watching you learn several
different systems over the years has been
[SPEAKER_03]: fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it shows in the herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've managed three large commercial
facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Technically two, because one wasn't very
functional.
[SPEAKER_01]: I left because it wasn't functional.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've managed three large facilities and
I've ran countless small home grows and
[SPEAKER_01]: I've consulted on hundreds of home grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been in enough grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've ran so many plants that I was doing
the math on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think last year they threatened to kill
people for the number you about to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not even fucking around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even want to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, I don't pay attention to politics,
but Mr. You saw that story, or at least I
[SPEAKER_01]: brought it up in front of you earlier
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to kill us for having too
many plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The numbers are large.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like anything you've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But depends where you live in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, how many pounds and we can disclose
this number.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many pounds last year do you think our
production facility produced?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how many pounds of cannabis we
produced last year out of that facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whenever I see on the news that they
busted a house and it had this many plants
[SPEAKER_03]: and it had this many pounds and it's worth
this many millions of dollars,
[SPEAKER_03]: I always convert that to the product that
went through the room that day and
[SPEAKER_03]: chuckle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Approximately, we're going to say 700
pounds of cannabis plus however many
[SPEAKER_01]: pounds of trim in one year.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my first year at a facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran another facility for approximately a
year and my first harvest there was 321
[SPEAKER_01]: pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've produced over a thousand pounds of
cannabis in two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to say I've got a little bit of
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then in the process to learning to that,
I only post my good pictures to Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I post my successes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way that I learned the most was my
fuck ups.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I had 10 clones- Fuck ups good
teachers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike saw me grow buds that were the size
of NFL footballs stacked on top of each
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we cut them up the middle,
they were moldy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an 11 ounce plant y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moldy up the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: White rhino buds that seriously properly
inflated NFL football.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kev looked at me like, Oh, you got jokes.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I stopped literally shopping with any
other provider or caregiver was the day I
[SPEAKER_03]: saw you take that, find it and throw the
entire thing in a trash bag and get out of
[SPEAKER_03]: the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: That wasn't fucking with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was all moldy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, I had met in a hundred other
places where people were like cut around
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I know not to grow football size
buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have taken plants and fed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it says to give it 50 mils of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I give it a hundred and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have done everything we can to torture
a plant on purpose here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I have gotten good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had 10 plants, I only need nine to
finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got one I can experiment with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I was going to do something weird,
just pick one and pick an experiment for
[SPEAKER_01]: this grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it dies and you got nine,
you only plan on having nine live to the
[SPEAKER_01]: end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be ready to kill one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Play with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best thing about your crop of weed
that you're growing right now is it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: the last crop of weed that you're going to
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: God willing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now have some faith.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of us are able to grow again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of us are like, we're in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are in California,
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are going to be smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to follow the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be discreet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now the market's changing really
fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as it changes, who's doing the growing
is changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a thing that came through here
when legalization, when medical happened,
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody went to the grow store and
bought a grow light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then a year and a half later, Craigslist
and nothing but grow lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody had grow shit for sale because
they all buy all the fancy equipment that
[SPEAKER_01]: the grow store will sell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they say, go do this and you'll be
able to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they go home and they can't grow for
fuck because they didn't listen to a
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't buy books.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't do their homework.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they don't realize that it's that it's
like getting a puppy that has me when
[SPEAKER_03]: people ask me like, what's the most
important thing I can have in a grow?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like the fucking book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like that's 100% the knowledge and
time and dedication.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just going to be walking there
once a day and look at it and leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to fucking take care of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's work to do every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I see people looking for like the I
want to be able to have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hidden and it needs to be the size of a
kitchen table is smaller and I need to be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to just look at it once or twice a
month.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, then go to the wheat store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, or like, or if it's only that
important to you, check out love for the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys have a micro grow master,
a camo micro grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a beautiful micro grows,
but like it's the hands off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ignore it component that I don't
understand at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter how much monitoring and auto
shit you have, you have to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to know if there's a spider mite,
if there's powdery mildew, you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: defoliate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to put trellis up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to work the canopy into the
trellis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to pop the stems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I just call it popping them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grab them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would grab here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd grab here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that's about a half inch between
my fingers and turn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it goes, it makes that noise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to break all the plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll start low and work my way all the way
up the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll start with the lowest branch
and work up each branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every branch gets all popped all the way
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: About every four to six inches apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll pop each plant a hundred times.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a decent size plant, pop,
pop, pop, pop, pop.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll leave there with our hands bucking,
looking all calloused up on pop day,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's work to do every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to trellis them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to pop them, make sure
everything's working.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got an auto water system,
how do you know an emitter isn't clogged?
[SPEAKER_01]: We get clogged emitters.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get clogged filters, pumps burnout,
shit goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fans burnout, bulbs go out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And light bulbs never burn out at the end
or beginning of a cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always about week six when
everything's big and bushy and fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: obnoxious and you got to move shit and get
up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit's going to go wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it needs that attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time I've seen somebody try to do,
I mean, even like a four day vacation,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just the grow gets tackled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you go do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, are you going to come here
and take care of the plants?
[SPEAKER_03]: There was an old video that I saw on
YouTube and I'm pretty sure it was
[SPEAKER_03]: Subcool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And his first sentence to the crowd is
shut up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all have to get home in a day and a
half.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in the entire room, they didn't even
laugh.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just went, huh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because all of them immediately got the
joke, understood why it was made,
[SPEAKER_03]: realized it was true for them too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And wanted to hear what the man had to
say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because just when you're in charge of a
crop, every time you shut that door,
[SPEAKER_03]: the clock starts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, Mike and I run a large
facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we drive away, I look in the rear
view mirror, like is anything on fire?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any smoke coming out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I've only got like 12 hours to leave
here before shit starts going wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we come home and record a podcast and
go take care of our family life and take a
[SPEAKER_01]: poop, a shower, some food, get back there,
make sure nothing went wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it's on that scale and it's not like
other industries where they've been doing
[SPEAKER_03]: it for a hundred years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the industrial version of what you
need is time tested and updated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so a lot of our shit we have to do on
our own.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the start of every day is go find what
broke.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most days nothing broke, but the day
you don't check, everything broke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you gotta be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just how it goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: In any case, I watched family members that
grew every time they would come up to
[SPEAKER_03]: Denver and visit for a day and a half,
their shit would die.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it got to the point where we were
like, Hey, we've got tickets to a game.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were like, fuck off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time I come up and visit for two
days, I come home to no livelihood and I
[SPEAKER_03]: have to start from scratch.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why people don't realize they got
to give me like a solid week in advance.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want me to do something Saturday,
you should have hit me up last Saturday
[SPEAKER_01]: because I have to get the plants on the
right rhythm to be gone overnight
[SPEAKER_01]: Saturday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if I water them Friday,
then I can't water them Saturday before I
[SPEAKER_01]: leave because then they're going to be too
wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to water them right before I leave
for whatever we're doing Saturday night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to water them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be gone overnight Saturday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to leave them like noon Saturday and
then get in the car and fucking go so I
[SPEAKER_01]: can be back Sunday before they start
getting too dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what makes me ripping in my
hair every time I hear somebody like,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, it's just weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone can grow it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anyone could just grow it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not even a grower and that irritates
me so bad when people tell me that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just try to force me to grow weed because
everyone can do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, no, they can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone can also make cash, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've run into this at every level from
like serious business owners that have
[SPEAKER_03]: invested millions to newspaper reporters
in city officials and police and friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just, oh, it's easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody can grow weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's no, like it's an acquired skill
that takes years and years and years of
[SPEAKER_03]: training to even get close to being able
to grow weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, it depends on what your target
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are just growing weed at
home, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're throwing a light.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got an affordable light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody can follow the steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're satisfied with their product,
which that makes me happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to grow, to make a profitable product
on a commercial level, on a reliable
[SPEAKER_01]: scale, that's when you start getting into
a lot of nuances.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to figure out, dial in a
strange nuances and dry and cure things
[SPEAKER_01]: properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like anybody could just throw some seed or
a clone in there and they can make it
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they're satisfied with that,
that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm proud of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want them to smoke that and love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want to take it to the next
level, it's going to take some skill.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take some learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can teach, I would say can teach
probably 60 to 70% of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But 40 to 30 to 40%, you're going to have
to be beside me every day for a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's shit that I can't even teach
you through this podcast, through a video.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to come touch the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a trade more than an equation.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to look, like to tell
you how much exactly I want defoliated.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to stand back from the room and I
have to show you like the whole room
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of one small section.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my view of a grow is way different
from other people's, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun, like teaching new people how to
do it on our scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you don't, especially with that
task, it's not something you can see until
[SPEAKER_03]: you're done with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to teach people, say we're
defoliating a table.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got our average room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So room A is 40 lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Room A is 40 lights and it would take two
or three dudes an entire day to properly
[SPEAKER_01]: defoliate for a week to defoliation the
way that I want it for proper light
[SPEAKER_01]: penetration.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we put, the right people in there,
if we put the wrong people in there and
[SPEAKER_01]: don't tell them to move around,
it would take four hours to defoliate one
[SPEAKER_01]: section really heavily and the rest of the
grow would just be leafy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got to tell them, listen to a song
and every song move to another table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen to a song and every song move to
another table because they're not used to
[SPEAKER_01]: such a large grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They think they're going to go in there
and defoliate that room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like from left to right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I tell them like just walk around the
table, like just kind of always be shuffle
[SPEAKER_03]: step into the layers.
[SPEAKER_03]: To the right and just work your way like a
typewriter, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're eating a piece of corn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want table one to be naked and
table three to be super furry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just start, give me a level one
manicure, a level two, a level three and
[SPEAKER_01]: just work your way back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to get people, yeah,
because they think they're going to go in
[SPEAKER_01]: there just like their home grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can leave this in like an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, dude, there are 40 lights in
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it takes you an hour to do the one at
home, that's 40 in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus these are much beefier plants because
we got gametas and turbo fucking charged
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really tall ceilings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ridiculous HVAC and Rasta Jeff Tech
and trellising all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are beefy plants in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take you quite a while to
reach in and trellis all that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That middle row, it's hard for me to
reach.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm six, five.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can only imagine what it's like for...
Dude, I'm responsible for all the tags at
[SPEAKER_03]: the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know how hard they are to reach.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that why they're in the dirt?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shattered the turtle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only metric fucking... Oh God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only metric certified people know why
that's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of Mike's plant tags are in the dirt,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all you fucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: His plants are fucking three feet tall and
the tags are just in the fucking dirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't make me talk about beer right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, that room is not a happy place to
be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can fight back.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you work in a metric regulated
facility, wherever... Metrics in like
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington and Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most legal states have adopted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you work with metric and you've got
those stupid fucking metric plant tags
[SPEAKER_01]: that supposedly are supposed to be affixed
in such a stupid way, I'd find that to be
[SPEAKER_01]: obnoxious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish it would hang so that I could read
the tag instead of have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow, here's a thing for you to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had somebody helpfully recommend we do
it the other way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck everyone involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, here's the thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find your metric or a compliance person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike is my person that handles metrics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what he's going to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to walk out of a grow room with
a perplexed look on your face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of you have it already because you've
been in the grow room and you've been
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking dabs all fucking day and the
lights are bright.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just going to be like, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Find your compliance person or your metric
person and walk up to them and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, why don't any of the plants in room A
have tags on them?
[SPEAKER_01]: And just... Don't say that shit to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch your metric person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the like... There are like five
things that have to absolutely happen in a
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have a badge on.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have a badge on, you got to
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Numero uno.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, got to have a visible badge above
the waist at all times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel weird talking about it without
having it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine's right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's how close I keep that badge.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I go... If I leave, I take it with
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I go to other dispensaries to shop,
I take it with me because oftentimes you
[SPEAKER_01]: can get a tour if you're me and they're
like, you got your badge?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, come on back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you don't have it, you're fucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just missed your chance for a tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it brings opportunities sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you also get a discount if you're in
the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But number one, you got to have a badge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number two, where am I getting plant tags?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like number two or number three is every
plant has to be tagged.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Colorado, pretty much two is plant
tags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you got to have a plant tag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like maybe badge, license on the wall,
plant tags.
[SPEAKER_03]: But plant tags ain't down to number four.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say waste accountability.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to weigh the fucking waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's things that people fuck up on all
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's such important shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just listed both components on my job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keeping track of plant tags and making
sure all the waste gets weighed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Mike does all the weighing and
packaging.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like 99% of my job is those first
two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: The part that people would be like,
man, I just want to go weigh weed all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's like, I got to weigh the fucking
weed all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Literally, that's what I'm doing all day
tomorrow for eight hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be putting weed on a scale and
writing numbers down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Literally for eight straight hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the number two thing is those plants
have to have a tag.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I cut a clone off of a plant,
I have to find that tag and write the
[SPEAKER_01]: strain name onto a piece of paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mother plant, that tag number that the
clone came from, and then how many clones
[SPEAKER_01]: came off of it and the date.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that sticker has to go with my
clones at all times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then once those clones are put into a
medium of anything, they come out of an
[SPEAKER_01]: easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they're rooted, Mike has to
immediately take this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The list is made when the clones are cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes into the computer as clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as they're put into dirt,
Mike moves them into another section of
[SPEAKER_01]: the computer called vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they get these tags every single
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of them has to have a tag.
[SPEAKER_01]: My cloner holds a hundred and eighty
clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for those of you who don't know about
this particular task in detail,
[SPEAKER_03]: each tag has to be filled out by hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Mike writes chem four, chem four,
chem four, chem four, chem four,
[SPEAKER_01]: chem four.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do about 40 clones of each strain
because I want to fill the rooms with
[SPEAKER_03]: chunks.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know the scene at the beginning of the
Simpsons where Bart's at the chalkboard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never understood how much that skill
like in grade school would come in handy
[SPEAKER_03]: later in life.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I was that kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now it's like fucking sour diesel,
sour diesel, sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite is when you write Gorilla Glue
and nobody can read what the fuck it says.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were like, what is soldier cloak?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is soldier cloak?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we get some new genetics here?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we just got an asshole that can't
fucking write.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to write in Sharpie.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you use a fine point, it's not
legible unless you've got the tag pressed
[SPEAKER_03]: to your face, which is fun because
sometimes they fall into the dirt,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is covered with nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes they get sprayed with
sprays, which are full of sprays.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you don't want that shit in your
face.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you got to use the fat Sharpie,
which fucking dulls after like two,
[SPEAKER_03]: two tags.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you end up fucking right with like a
goddamn paintbrush.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't write for shit to begin with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my fucking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, don't even get me started,
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too late.
[SPEAKER_01]: I already got you started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too late.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody who fills out that tags is a
hundred percent with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rest of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for joining the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we get?
[SPEAKER_01]: You see the labels I've got over there,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like for my, for those labels,
they come out of that normal printer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not compliant from what I understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't just print those and stick them
onto that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty sure the stick is non-compliant.
[SPEAKER_03]: S-M-I-D.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause the stuff that's written on the
front of that in the back of it,
[SPEAKER_03]: like I'm, I would have to talk to someone
above me about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen another facility do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my idea may be non-compliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may be correct because we could just
be too high to buy the right printer in
[SPEAKER_03]: the right tag.
[SPEAKER_03]: My guess is that anything you stick isn't
going to hold right because of the wet the
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they make plastic ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or we stick them on the outside of the
fucking plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm cool with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Metric tags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go in there, walk out of the room with
this look on your face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what the hell happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then walk up to your compliance
person, metric person and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: what happened to all the tags in B?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to have a little,
they might pee themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a touch, just a touch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Depending on their anxiety level at the
moment, they might pee themselves a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on how long metric has been
spinning around metric likes to give you
[SPEAKER_01]: the wheel of death.
[SPEAKER_01]: You try to use metric and it just shows
you on the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just spins.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cursor just goes, not today
motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: It always happens at nine times out of 10
metric will freeze when you've got a
[SPEAKER_01]: delivery driver waiting to pick up and
you're just waiting to print the manifest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know people would say,
why don't you print it before they come?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you put a driver name and a car
license plate on a manifest and print it,
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking promise you a different driver
in a different car will show up.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the two will not be every time and
you have to reprint.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's a Colorado regulated thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to reprint.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't white it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to go back to the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to adjust it in the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you got to print it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just wait for them to show up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause if they say Kevin's coming at four
on a Honda, I guarantee fucking to you,
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike showing up at five in a Nissan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's just, that's fucking the
medical marijuana industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gotten better, but yeah, we've got
some drivers that are actually pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: punctual and we piss them off because we
take a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually, I like it when they're on
time and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks much better for this industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one dude shows up way early and that
ain't cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other dude, same time, every week,
every, every pickup.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Consistency.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how you make me happy at work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey you guys, if you are one of the
drivers and those little silver sprinter
[SPEAKER_01]: vans that's doing pickups and
dispensaries, uh, bro, you guys are,
[SPEAKER_01]: you look like Hetty Wooks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing against the Hetty Wooks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kev, I love you bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my hat pins too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my grassroots hat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my baggy pants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my fucking Merrell's.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fucking Wook the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got dreadlocks down to the floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I see that paired with work
equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I see that Wook and that van,
uh, I'm a good person, but I started
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking like some fucking Ocean's 13 shit
and how to get that fucking van in my
[SPEAKER_01]: garage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and you guys, you're kind of,
you're totally identifying who you are and
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, it's legal now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But motherfuckers are still motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to worry about the police,
but you have to worry about thieves and be
[SPEAKER_01]: safe, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it sounds like old man just
preaching at you, but when you're all
[SPEAKER_01]: Wooked out in that Sprinter van,
I know what you got.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a good person, but that doesn't
mean that everybody who has made that
[SPEAKER_01]: correlation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you see, you see them in Denver,
uh, in the right lane, lost as fuck,
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at their GPS going, where's live?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they're just driving a Sprinter van,
dreadlocks and fucking hat pins in a
[SPEAKER_01]: hoodie, fucking leaned up over the
steering wheel, high as shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you guys can spot them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a couple of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been out, I drive to Denver
frequently and you got the Sprinter van
[SPEAKER_01]: with the fucking refrigeration in the
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got concentrates or you're picking
up and it's obvious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're not an armored truck and you've
got more shit in you than an armored truck
[SPEAKER_01]: would.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of keep that in mind you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you're on the other side of that
token, Hey, there's a bunch of fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: hippies.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're on the other side of that token,
there's a bunch of fucking hippies driving
[SPEAKER_01]: around in Sprinter vans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tip me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Commission.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hit up my fucking Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you guys so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we come out of the shadows,
we need to remember why we did some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: shit we did the shadows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I remember how good it felt to be
free here and how much I wanted to walk up
[SPEAKER_03]: to everybody and be like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I like weed and that's all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just walk off because it was
fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was so much shit heaped onto it for
so long.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we finally got to the point where
like as a boating population, we said fuck
[SPEAKER_03]: Prohibition.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're done with that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Weeds legal here, like regular legal,
get it at a store legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that was before we went overboard
with the rules and regs and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like I remember how good that felt.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember why we shed a lot of the
stuff that we had during the Prohibition
[SPEAKER_03]: days.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now they're busting like 30 guys a
week who are just growing 100 plants in
[SPEAKER_03]: their shed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every one of these motherfuckers,
they bust them and they're like,
[SPEAKER_03]: what were you thinking?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were like, I thought it was
legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to fucking slap these
people like you're ruining it for the rest
[SPEAKER_03]: of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: What aren't you getting?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I get that it's still thirty five
hundred a pound if you can get it all the
[SPEAKER_03]: way to New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: But fuck your profit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you're ruining our dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quit it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quit it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or at least be circumspect about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there used to be whole magazine
articles about not getting caught by your
[SPEAKER_03]: landlord.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we got people showing up, renting a
house, fucking kicking doors down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a friend who used to manage a
grocery store, and he told me that one of
[SPEAKER_01]: his favorite things to do was when kids
would come in and be all hyped.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my medical marijuana card.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want four lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want a filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go blow up the whole
basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: They buy all this shit and they pay cash
for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he'd smile and hand him a bunch of
boxes that say grocery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pro light, ballast, carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he'd smile and go, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'd be like, can I get a box or
something?
[SPEAKER_01]: He'd be like, nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good night.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just carry that shit right out to
their car.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he'd be like, I thought you were bad,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you were fucking going to go
hard because it's legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that now that you're thinking
about it, you got to carry four lights
[SPEAKER_01]: into your house.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want anyone to see that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't just for the police that we went
through all that bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there were articles about hiding from
your landlord because sometimes landlords
[SPEAKER_03]: get pissed and throw your ass out in the
street.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're growing weed illegally,
they can do that without batting an
[SPEAKER_03]: eyelash, regardless of what landlord
tenant laws in your state.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like to talk too much about stuff
like this, but it's a reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: When medical marijuana first became legal
here, there was a guy, Kevin shaking his
[SPEAKER_01]: head.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know who I'm talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: A guy named Eric Wagner, who had a medical
marijuana grow in this neighborhood and
[SPEAKER_01]: three guys kicked in his front door and
murdered him for his medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people forget that it's worth a lot of
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it was worth $3,500 a pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was $300 an ounce easily around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you got it out of here,
it was way more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 4,000 on the East coast, 5,000 on the
East coast back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they knew people East, the people that
shot him and killed him.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one of the sheriffs up North.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say El Paso or one of those
might've been Denver racked up like 11
[SPEAKER_03]: homicides that they could tie to exactly
that string of events.
[SPEAKER_03]: People who want weed, but don't have money
for weed, find out you have weed,
[SPEAKER_03]: shoot you and take your weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then take it back to wherever they're
from and sell it at the ridiculous price
[SPEAKER_03]: that weed sells more there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's still plenty of that in Colorado
because it's still a commodity.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're basically posting on Facebook,
Hey guys, look at all this jewelry I just
[SPEAKER_03]: bought.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, I don't have a safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just in my spare bedroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because it's legal in Colorado and we
are, uh, kind of soft.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're, we're, we're soft.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody around us is super soft and
we've gotten soft and comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people here's, here's what I think I'm
trying to say that I have that edge
[SPEAKER_03]: anymore because we're not dealing with it
used to be a gangster business.
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to be a thug business.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people that used to grow and have
cannabis and produce that much of a
[SPEAKER_01]: valuable product, had a gun, had some
street credit, had some homies knew how to
[SPEAKER_01]: throw down, knew what to look for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then one day we're like, it's legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, people that had no business
in that kind of business got in that
[SPEAKER_01]: business and didn't realize I've kind of
delved into the black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like doctors, lawyers were setting up
businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like our friend that we used to have the
dispensary with, he had no business
[SPEAKER_01]: dealing with some of my other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the middleman for people that he
should have never been involved with,
[SPEAKER_01]: but he was because of me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there were a lot of people that came
in, came in the door in those days looking
[SPEAKER_03]: to move product that, that they never
could have moved safely in any other
[SPEAKER_03]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not, again, I could have robbed some
of those fucking people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could have said, boo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would say, where's here?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had no business being in that sort of
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your 14 year old Kevin looks like your
cousin, Kevin looks like Omar from the
[SPEAKER_03]: wire to, you know, most of these people.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just fucking nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'd come in terrified.
[SPEAKER_03]: They all looked the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're fucking clutching the messenger
bag that held two quarter pound jars and
[SPEAKER_03]: they'd come in hugging it like it was a
baby, but they were trying to football
[SPEAKER_03]: carry it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'd go, is your purchasing manager
here?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they'd look around the waiting
room to see if anybody heard every fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they tried to sell that by the
ounce to their friends, even they were
[SPEAKER_03]: going to get a gun in their face real
quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just how the market used to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: People forgot that people got soft and
complacent and they let their shit be
[SPEAKER_01]: seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be driving and I'll see somebody
making a delivery.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do a dispensary and they open the back of
their truck and there's so much products
[SPEAKER_03]: right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, what are you doing,
dude?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not even barely paying attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a random dude with a break in a dream
could have your shit in 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Fast guy with some Nikes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all it takes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't you see Ninja Turtles 2?
[SPEAKER_03]: See where the U is?
[SPEAKER_03]: Drop one box and run.
[SPEAKER_03]: How fast was that truck emptied?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're high as fuck than downtown
Denver leaving the roll top open.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, come on now, pay attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys want to take more dabs
and start wrapping up the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been going for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be some editing to be
done on this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a lot, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're going to edit this down to
something listenable instead of just fully
[SPEAKER_01]: rambles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost used my actual Bic pen as a
dabber here on accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad I paid attention to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long have we been going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we've got two hours of stuff on the
screen, but I would say we've been going
[SPEAKER_01]: for an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it a take.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike nodded his head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who remembers the time I tried to write
with my dabber?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I picked up this pencil and tried to
write with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was going to say I finally matched
him out because I almost just took a dab
[SPEAKER_01]: with my actual pen.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a story where they tried to say
a kid died from weed and he actually died
[SPEAKER_03]: from smoking plastic Pez dispenser.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, that's how that happens is
people try to dab off a Bic pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's different shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like when people get drunk and
drive into people and they smoke the joint
[SPEAKER_01]: before they left the bar, but they also
had 172 beers and they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, they crashed and died because they
smoked weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spent $900.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, wait, he had fucking 172 beers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, look at his credit card tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it had to be the weed because alcohol
is completely safe and okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could buy it at the bar.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have to get me back for a Mike goes
fucking off for a while show.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of emailers have asked for Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want an episode on how to be active
in their area and just more Mike rambles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys should send me one of that
shit too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, you have yourself, here's a dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like some of my fine
concentrates or would you like some of
[SPEAKER_01]: your sour diesel or?
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to figure out how many more I want
to take before I leave and thinking I want
[SPEAKER_03]: to go for King Louie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dab the King Louie.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a dabber here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely don't need any more jewels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is a carb cap that works with that
rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like you need El Torcherino,
El Inferno.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I work with Sharpies all day and none
of my hash is labeled.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've got to keep it in the fucking
packaging.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so much required labeling that
like we haven't gotten around to doing the
[SPEAKER_03]: useful labeling yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my, more than I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a little more than I need to,
but I think it's going to be a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kev, I will pass you this torch as soon as
I get done with it and you can dab with
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Feel free to help yourself to anything I
got over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of first saw that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you said King Louie, Kev lit up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little phase two hit man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Big D.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a kind of a sort of a gift from
Big D.
[SPEAKER_01]: There may have been a trade involved,
but we'll call it a gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Big D.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're doing well, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, he's doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to be grammatically correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was he not quite great?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know D's always been an amazing dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's always doing quite well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then the first one was grammatically
correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just so high you thought you had to
change it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just try to not sound like a dipshit
because I'm smoking a bunch of dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to go in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sound like a dope shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got, I got to go in kind of hot because
this is a big crystal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here I go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about all the silence on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, we're taking dad's dab with us,
please.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that it sounds like a fucking
NASA.
[SPEAKER_01]: We shouldn't dab all at the same time next
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you guys got to give me quite the
head start at the same time.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to give me like two minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kev's nail is super thick, takes a long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gorilla glue, when you let that cool
and hit that in just right temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is so delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just, the high is coming over my
head.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a kind of got my eyes going right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm pulling my beanie down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is super nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're making me twitch a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There goes Mike going to cough into the
mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike on the mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to turn him down just a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, you don't want to hear him die.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up Kev?
[SPEAKER_01]: You look scared.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not scared.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not scared.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would I be scared?
[SPEAKER_01]: Waiting to, waiting to see what you're
going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do to yourself with that dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's going to hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to hurt in such a good way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love those dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hurt.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: After the hurt goes away.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, but that like, I have it right
now where it's like, I got to breathe
[SPEAKER_01]: properly or I'm not going to breathe
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like an adrenaline thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like a tattoo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similar, but not as, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people might find it as intense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big dude and I take giant dabs and
I've been doing it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a normal non dab connoisseur.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do that arm thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They swirl their arms around and they turn
a curl up into a little ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look at me like, what'd you just do
to me?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that move.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've given you those dabs several times.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my pleasure, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, you going to be okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll turn your mic back on.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'll be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you sound fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as I turned his mic on,
he looks at me and coughs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, I'm still shaking it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, that was not a beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a Mountain Dew that you heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounded a lot like a Hank Hill beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to hear the King of the Hills
song.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to John Redcorn.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, John Redcorn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big Mountain fudge cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kev, that's a huge dab, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the way that that rig fits in your
hand like a goblet like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a little handle on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't resemble a cognac sifter,
but it's got that perch to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of my favorite episodes,
one of my favorite things that's ever
[SPEAKER_01]: happened on a podcast was not on this
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was on 719 The Blocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about Siegfried and Roy,
the flamboyant entertainers from Las
[SPEAKER_01]: Vegas, who one of them was attacked by a
lion.
[SPEAKER_01]: We spoke about this lion attack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tiger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was a tiger, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a tiger.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got eight so long ago, you done forgot
the animal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm glad you corrected me because
it's a huge part of what I was going to
[SPEAKER_01]: say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just been fucking up things on this
podcast the whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got way late, which is fine with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ended an episode of 719 The Blocks and
everybody said goodbye.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all said our we love yous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, all right, peace and love.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to end the episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Kev goes, shout out to anyone that
owns a tiger.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, dude, I totally forgot about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of my favorite clips ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: From a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to anybody that owns a tiger.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to the people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was my last one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about Siegfried and Roy getting
eaten by their pet on that episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to anyone that owns a tiger.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always going to be golden in my
mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that was fucking dope.
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally forgot about that, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody just sent me a is this a gift?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just sent me a gift of the Spartan
and the three hundred number on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody knows what's up tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: People send me the three hundred.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know people know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
you guys want to start wrapping up this
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin's yawning over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need some food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, shout out to the bedtime kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, snap.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that already happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Mike's going to be in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry to get you in trouble, Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Mike's Mike's family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for letting me hang out and steal
your husband for a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for letting me borrow your daddy
for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did a very good podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So give him a high five.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job, Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hearing you use that word refer to me,
fuck my head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were a good husband and a good father,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's OK.
Gracias.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try.
[SPEAKER_03]: You handle things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't call me daddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I was referring to like, no,
I wasn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the relationship I have with my son.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just still fucks my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm not calling you daddy,
big guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, please don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's more awkward than I'm ready to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all down with weird every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: You thought you're done with having to
make edits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm going to leave that in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for hanging
out with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was episode number 300.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what you expected.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what I expected, but I know
what we got and I fucking had a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope everybody here at the table had as
much fun as I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me again,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, anytime, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime you want to come be on a podcast,
let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will keep the listeners updated on your
sobriety here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ever need support with that pro,
you'd call me and call Mike anytime.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you already know that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's going to be necessary,
but you know, whenever, uh, you've been
[SPEAKER_03]: tested and you've won two other cannabis
only guys that you know, and get along
[SPEAKER_03]: with, and you know, we probably have good
hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, there's like 11 reasons to call
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can call for reasons other than so
bright to your podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Mike, you can come be on the show
whenever, uh, yeah, whenever you just need
[SPEAKER_03]: to get away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here is way more often if I could get
away.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm trying to build this into a more
structured schedule, but we'll see how
[SPEAKER_03]: that goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: LOL.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: With children.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I said, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Those of you that have kids understand
those that you don't have kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll find out soon enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll get it eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Podcast world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you stock everybody on all the
proper social media, elevated constant
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrations, elevated concentrations
for Kevin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, find white Mike at Pueblo for sensible
cannabis laws on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's NemoPunk15.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other social medias that start with
an at, you'll be able to find him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, find me on Facebook search for
irie genetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use my other company name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's irie underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I invite you to follow me on Instagram
because I do Instagram live feeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go talk to my audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys can throw me questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will answer them live right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've made a lot of new friends,
kind of stay at home a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I don't like to go out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of my, uh, my social
interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find me there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also find me on Twitter.

[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are 200 videos available.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the old 200 episodes on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you will enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a product you would like me
to review, if you'd like to sponsor the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast, or if you've got something to say
and you're not into all the social media
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, you can send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, don't forget about Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike did a good job earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to remind you once again,
patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a way to financially contribute to
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not begging, just looking for support
needed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It did eat itself twice as often as it
normally does today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those of you that have been
contributing, double thank you right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that money's going to a real worthy
cause.
True.
[SPEAKER_03]: Without the Mac book, there is no podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the
episode, I usually do, Oh, you know what
[SPEAKER_01]: we didn't mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about things in the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to breed more lemon Jeffrey
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's coming in the future, but I want to
give a huge shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually do a shout out to one individual
person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say all this stuff about I'll be
back on Thursday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out the mini episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you back Monday with another fresh
episode, thanks to all the sponsors,
[SPEAKER_01]: contributors, the guests, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then usually I say a huge shout out to a
specific person this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you hear this shout out, thank you for
the support.
[SPEAKER_01]: 300 episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reason to do 300 episodes of a
podcast without a loyal audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be schizophrenia or some shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I kept doing it without an audience,
you're just a crazy person with a
[SPEAKER_03]: computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a lot of fancy, expensive toys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I thought as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys, you are proving that I am not
completely insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But honestly, dude, 300 episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have been outpouring support.
[SPEAKER_01]: My social media explodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: My email explodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The YouTube channel has been getting views
and comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: The podcast has been getting, been getting
downloads on all platforms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: This little show that started here at this
kitchen table is making a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't know I could even do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to put out some advice that was
true and I'm making a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't be a difference without you
guys actually doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a, I love that we're achieving or
you're achieving the goal you set
[SPEAKER_03]: originally in such a fashion now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I never saw it getting this big in or
going this long and to see that how many
[SPEAKER_03]: people this has helped is just fucking
awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Better weed coast to coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just coast to coast worldwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting people that listen in the
UK, people in Australia, people all over
[SPEAKER_01]: the place listen to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of our sponsors are located.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their home bases are in other countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've, we're doing it all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you guys bring more audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Kev's people are going to listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your people are going to listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some interesting people in my world have
been like, don't you go on a show from
[SPEAKER_03]: time to time?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I get that info?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're going to share it with
some interesting people as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody that listens to the show,
thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said earlier, I would just be
schizophrenic or something if I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have an audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't, it would be kind of strange to
do this without all of your support.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for listening to 300 episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I promise to keep delivering you quality
content.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as this computer and this
production equipment works and my brain
[SPEAKER_01]: and my throat will all function properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to keep putting out podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as Mike promises to keep coming
over, I'll keep having them on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kev, same with you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't even have to have dads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just show up, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just show up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just be like, Hey, I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get an idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also you guys, I love doing the listener
generated content.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you send me emails and you say,
Hey Rasta Jeff, my plants are doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: My grow room's doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need some help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please help me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That lets me know that I can help
somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure that if you're having that
problem, if one dude in Texas has a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem, that means that a dude in Iowa,
Alabama, Kansas, and Louisiana probably
[SPEAKER_01]: have a similar problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just haven't bothered to email me
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they were going to.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I like the email show so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It lets me know that I'm hitting a target
instead of just blabbering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe this is a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it lets me know I'm actually getting
my idea out to at least one person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, if one person has that
problem, a lot of people, we had a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand people listen to an episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to have helped 20,000 people with
the proper thing that week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody learned something.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Teach you guys right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep you going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep your gardens growing strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make everybody grow better cannabis,
safer, cleaner cannabis so that patients
[SPEAKER_01]: and recreational smokers can stay healthy
and enjoy the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of an experiment that somebody had to
put in.
I was like, Oh, I'm not asking for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm asking for that product, the way it
was meant to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm rambling from those dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's wrap up a podcast, ladies and
gentlemen, shout out to everybody that
[SPEAKER_01]: listens to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mama hug for me.
