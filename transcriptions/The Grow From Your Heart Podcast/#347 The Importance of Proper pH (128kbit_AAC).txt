[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 347 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast, your source for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis news, education and conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by our friends at the Hella Dance Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular or feminized seeds
for your garden, I highly recommend the
[SPEAKER_00]: Hella Dance Seed Company and you can find
them at www.danceseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, grow up a fat
spliff, pack up a fat bowl, put some fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: water in the bong, turn on that vaporizer
or start heating up that dab nail because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's time for a fresh episode of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start these episodes
off by letting you know what I am smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got back from the dispensary and I
picked up something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grabbed some cherry chem nectar from
Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is cherry pie kush and chem four
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor on the packaging is described
as dark black cherry, baked pie,
[SPEAKER_00]: grape chewable vitamins and acetone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get the dark black cherry immediately
when you open it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you smell, in my opinion,
that dark black cherry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you hit it, you get that dark
black cherry flavor on the inhale.
[SPEAKER_00]: The baked pie, kind of, yeah, maybe on the
exhale as the smoke goes over your tongue,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll get that baked pie flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grape chewable vitamins may be what
they're describing this aftertaste as.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a unique aftertaste.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of lemony.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of almost tastes like dish soap to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost tastes a little bit like if you
had too much cilantro in a salsa and it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets that dish soap sort of a flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of got that aftertaste going on
to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not sure if I enjoy it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high from the cherry chem nectar went
straight to my arms and my shoulders and
[SPEAKER_00]: my back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not get any sort of a head change
from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you could tell how clear
my head is, how clearly I'm speaking,
[SPEAKER_00]: how unhigh I am, but my arms definitely
got a little jello-y.
[SPEAKER_00]: My back got relaxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: My shoulders went, hey, that's kind of
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a smoking a back rub is kind
of what it was like, but it didn't do shit
[SPEAKER_00]: for me mentally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do an intro here and then we'll
take a pause and probably dab some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: copper chem nectar because that has
definitely been hitting the spot lately or
[SPEAKER_00]: the infinity OG nectar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked that one too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's move forward with the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm dabbing the cherry chem nectar for
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take a break in a minute
and go in on something with a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more of a head high, but until then,
let's get a nice podcast intro laid down.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, where do you guys want to
start?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Friday, Bert Kreischer released a new
comedy special called Secret Time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He released it on Netflix and it is
hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I highly recommend the new Bert
Kreischer special.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not aware, I am a huge comedy
nerd.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love going to see live comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love watching comedy shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think comedy is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comedy is medicine in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really good for you to go laugh and
get away from some shit for a good hour
[SPEAKER_00]: and a half and just laugh your ass off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a connection with a bunch of other
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all get in that tight room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get told the same jokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all feel that same releasing vibe and
then you go back into the world a little
[SPEAKER_00]: refreshed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think comedy is really good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of picky on the comedians I will
go see and I will definitely go see Bert
[SPEAKER_00]: Kreischer every opportunity I get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bert's new special is hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, a few months back I talked about
going to see Bert at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all of my friends at
ComedyWorks for taking such great care of
[SPEAKER_00]: me all the time, but when I saw Bert at
ComedyWorks, I noticed he had cameras and
[SPEAKER_00]: such set up and he was recording and he
was talking about doing a Netflix special
[SPEAKER_00]: and he did most of the material that's on
his new special.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to see him do most of that material
live at ComedyWorks several months ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some reason he chose not to use the
ComedyWorks footage and he taped in
[SPEAKER_00]: another place, but Bert's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does test runs and all kinds of strange
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bert's a weird character, but if you're
into comedy, if you want to laugh your ass
[SPEAKER_00]: off, if you want to see what I laugh my
ass off, go check out the new comedy
[SPEAKER_00]: special from Bert Kreischer on Netflix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is called Secret Time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't pay me to say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think it's hilarious and I think
you'll love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll enjoy it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, what else do we need to talk
about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode will come out Thursday,
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish, my favorite band, will be in Denver
for three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're playing at Dix, the giant soccer
field in Commerce City.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be there for all three shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to any of the shows at Dix
and you see me, please say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so frustrating when I get home from
Dix and Monday or Tuesday I'm scrolling
[SPEAKER_00]: through Instagram and I see somebody say,
hey bro, saw you at Dix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't want to bother you so I didn't say
hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, it's a Fish concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say fucking hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're outside in the parking lot,
if we're walking through the crowd,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we're somewhere in there, say what's
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could say hi during the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to probably be wearing a shirt
that says don't talk to me while Fish is
[SPEAKER_00]: playing, but if you just want to high five
me and introduce yourself, I'm down,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't bug me during Harry Hood or
punch you in the eye and we should be all
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, punch you in the eye is a song that's
not a result of bugging me during Harry in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Hood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Punch you in the eye is a song.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me clear that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't talk to me during punch you in the
eye at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, Fish is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're there, stop and say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people always tell me I saw you
at this event or at this place and I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't want to bug you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, you're not bugging me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to those events to talk to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I didn't want to see people,
I wouldn't show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd stay home and I'd hide out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a high five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met a lot of cool people last year,
so I look forward to seeing some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: people again and meeting new people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big old shout out to Amber and her
husband.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met Amber in the line getting a lemonade
last year and I actually talked about it
[SPEAKER_00]: on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be shy, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you see me talking to somebody
else, don't be shy to jump in because you
[SPEAKER_00]: may be rescuing me.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like to chew off the ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come say what's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be my knight in shining armor at
that moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I think that's enough
chitter chatter for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys aren't here to hear about my
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are here to learn about cannabis
news, education and conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are like, what's with the
journal?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's with the fucking diary entry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get on with the podcast about
growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, this episode is
gonna be about the importance of pH and
[SPEAKER_00]: adjusting your pH correctly in your feed
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I do that, I think I'm gonna
press pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna listen back to the part I have
recorded.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna take a couple of dabs and once
I'm satisfied with this intro,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will come back and I will talk about the
importance of properly adjusting the pH of
[SPEAKER_00]: your nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took some dabs of the copper chem
nectar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm in slow motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I need a Dr. Pepper and
possibly a helmet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're gonna be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do a podcast about the importance of
pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good spot to start is what does pH mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: pH stands for potential hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why when you see pH written,
it is a lowercase P and an uppercase H.
[SPEAKER_00]: The H stands for hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what pH stands for.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is basically what we need to know
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH stands for potential hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is pH?
[SPEAKER_00]: pH is the scale used to measure the
acidity and alkalinity of a solution,
[SPEAKER_00]: the acid and base of a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH ranges from one to 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven is neutral.
[SPEAKER_00]: A pH value below seven is acidic.
[SPEAKER_00]: A pH value above seven is considered
alkaline or base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I've done some research and we can
go into the negative ranges and we can go
[SPEAKER_00]: above 14 in extreme cases, but that is
very rare so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about some things and their pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with Dr. Pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a bottle of Dr. Pepper in front
of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Pepper pH is three.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH of dairy milk, like if you had some
cow milk, the milk in most people's
[SPEAKER_00]: refrigerator, I don't drink dairy milk
myself, but the milk that a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: have in their refrigerator, milk,
the pH value of milk is about 6.5 to 6.7.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bleach, everybody knows bleach,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH of bleach is 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are just a few examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH value of a few solutions that we
are all familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most things within the human body hover
around a pH of seven from most of what I
[SPEAKER_00]: have read.
[SPEAKER_00]: Randomly, one of the charts I was looking
at listed the pH of urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're curious, the pH,
I don't know how they know the pH of my
[SPEAKER_00]: urine and your urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we that common?
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, piss is listed at a pH of six.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why, but they've got it
listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that we've got a few examples of
the pH of solutions in which we are
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar, let's talk about the pH in our
nutrient solution when we're feeding our
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH of our feed solution determines
which nutrients are available to our
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may have mixed the perfect nutrients
solution to make the plants explode with
[SPEAKER_00]: growth, but if the pH is off, the plant
won't uptake the nutrients we offered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poor pH will cause slow growth,
yellow leaves and diminished yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Improper pH will also lead to other
problems like lockouts and poor pH is
[SPEAKER_00]: often confused with other nutrient
deficiencies and it will make a grower
[SPEAKER_00]: react to a deficiency causing even more
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you think you've got nitrogen
deficiency because the pH is too high,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants aren't eating, so you increase
the nitrogen and then you're really just
[SPEAKER_00]: burning the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're causing more of a lockout.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're causing more problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low pH looks like burned or wilting
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: High pH will make your plants yellow and
slow and skinny and shitty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So proper pH is important because each
mineral is absorbed by the plant at
[SPEAKER_00]: specific pH ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're feeding the plants 16 minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants want 16 minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're adding other stuff to that 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we're putting Mycos in there and we
get crazy and add our own stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they basically want these 16 minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want these 16 minerals for our plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've learned that most of those 16
minerals are best available in a solution
[SPEAKER_00]: with a pH around 6 to 6.5 depending on
your specific cultivar, your specific
[SPEAKER_00]: medium, and of course your specific
environment, your lighting, your
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, your humidity, your vapor
pressure, your deficit are all going to
[SPEAKER_00]: make a difference, but mainly it will be
your medium and that specific cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do say specific cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast rolled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why, but for some reason
right here in the recording, the software
[SPEAKER_00]: made a hideous noise, so I cut it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You missed four seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to dial it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial setting, we decide on a pH
that works for most of our plants and we
[SPEAKER_00]: run that pH for the crop and we take notes
and we make sure it's working and we
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust if we need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the majority of the plants are
satisfied, we leave it at the pH we've
[SPEAKER_00]: decided.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial facility in Cocoa,
I like to run about 6.3 on the pH when I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we see issues, we adjust a little
higher or a little lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually stick between 6 and 6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: I rarely go to 6.5, maybe 6.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually 6.2 to 6.4 is where I want to stay
on my pH in a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about nutrient availability
on a pH scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a chart in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this chart lists nitrogen,
phosphorus, potassium, sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on and lists a lot of different
nutrients here, a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it shows the pH range at which
each element is available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it shows each element taper off from
end to end as it becomes less available at
[SPEAKER_00]: a different pH range.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows that nitrogen is barely available
in the 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5 range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we get to 6, 6.5, and 7, the little
graph of availability gets huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nitrogen, and then it tapers off again
once we get to the 8, 8.5, and then by 9,
[SPEAKER_00]: 9, 5, and 10, it's totally unavailable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can see that the ideal range for
nitrogen would be somewhere between 6 and
[SPEAKER_00]: 8.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like nitrogen is plenty available
right there in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then right underneath there is
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the chart for phosphorus is much less
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down here at the 4, 4.5, all the way to
about 5.7, there's no phosphorus
[SPEAKER_00]: availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you hit 6, the little balloon of
phosphorus availability swells up and it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like you've created a dart.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one looks like a missile.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way it tapers, this one looks like a
dart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes real skinny, skinny, skinny,
totally available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right as we hit the 6 area,
we've got a lot of phosphorus available.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH of 6 gives us a lot of availability
of phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it starts tapering off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right at 7, 5, it tapers off a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: By 8, we're almost done.
[SPEAKER_00]: At 8, 5, phosphorus has cut itself off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But oddly enough, around 8.7, phosphorus
really becomes available.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the way from 8.7 to 10, it is just
fully available.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can see there's a commonality here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This area where phosphorus is real wide in
the middle and nitrogen is real wide is
[SPEAKER_00]: right about 6.2 to 7.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why wouldn't I start thinking about
getting my pH dialed into 6.2 to 7.5 on
[SPEAKER_00]: this scale so far, it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as we move down, potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium is widely available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we get above 5.5, potassium comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sulfur, kind of similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcium, now this is why we're trying to
narrow down our pH a little bit tighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcium is not available at all until we
get to about 6.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you've passed, let's see,
once you've passed 7, the calcium starts
[SPEAKER_00]: tapering off very heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right between 6 and 7, that calcium
comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we pretty much, by looking at this
chart, I see that I don't even want to do
[SPEAKER_00]: anything lower than 6.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing is even available other than
potassium and nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 6.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to get any sulfur,
I'm not going to get any calcium,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm not going to get any magnesium
from what I'm seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Magnesium and calcium are on a very
similar curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one is iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iron is the opposite of potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iron is hyper available at low levels of
pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're down here in the 4.5,
5.5, all the way to 6, iron is heavily
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it starts tapering at 6.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time we get to 7, there's a
very low availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: of iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, why would I can't go up to 7 on my
pH, because that's going to push me out of
[SPEAKER_00]: having iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I've got to narrow it down to about
6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's looking like if I want to get this
bubble of nitrogen at its peak,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's bubble of phosphorus at its peak,
these charts really make sense once you
[SPEAKER_00]: see it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The manganese and boron are very similar
in the shape and zinc.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very similar in their shape of pH
availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start off at 4.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not very available.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time we get to 5, they're quite
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: That lasts all the way through about the
6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they start tapering off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, again, is another opportunity for
us to dial it into 6.5 or lower,
[SPEAKER_00]: or we're going to start losing the
availability of manganese, boron,
[SPEAKER_00]: copper, and zinc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Molybdenum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Molybdenum basically mirrors potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little thinner at the beginning
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't become available until about 6,
6.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we're going to have to go a
little bit to about the 6.2 just to get
[SPEAKER_00]: that molybdenum in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've got the point across.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a chart that shows where the
nutrients available.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a stripe that goes down and shows
the pH range, and it makes it really
[SPEAKER_00]: obvious when you see this chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you Google for one of these pH scale
and cannabis charts, it will be really
[SPEAKER_00]: easy to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that chart makes it easy to see why we
would adjust the pH of our feed solution
[SPEAKER_00]: to a range of 6.2 to 6.5 or 6.0 to 6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start at 6.3.
[SPEAKER_00]: And adjust as needed because I can see
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell when they need to go higher,
when they need to go lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell if there's a lockout.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more experienced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write it down, take a lot of notes,
and pay attention to what you're doing in
[SPEAKER_00]: your garden, and you will be able to
diagnose the problems as they come along.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to adjust your pH as
needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to tell the difference
between a pH problem and a CalMag
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency if you are writing down the pH
of your solution every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not adjusting it, if you're not
paying any attention to it, you may have a
[SPEAKER_00]: CalMag solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have a pH issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have a nutrient lockout issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be anything at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can at least diagnose problems by
knowing what the pH is going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk about checking the pH
coming out in a later episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So small plants will need lower pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cuttings, rooting clones, they could go as
low as 5.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: And veg and early flower move up just a
little bit to about 6.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: By full flower, I meant 6.3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe 6.4, depending on the needs of that
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see micronutrient deficiencies
during flower, try lowering the pH of your
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient solution, and that will make your
micronutrients more bioavailable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about mixing up your
nutrients and adjusting the pH of your
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: This applies for any size container.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're mixing up a gallon, if you're
mixing up a thousand gallons, this will be
[SPEAKER_00]: similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got something big enough that it
needs a lot of stirring that you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: stir it by hand, anything more than 5 or
10 gallons, I would put a pump in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got one of the brute trash cans,
I always drop a small pump in the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that water moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use your water source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever water you're using, I'm not going
to be specific about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using tap water, if you're using
RO water, if you're using whatever water
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got, do that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you've had it tested and it's
working for you, use your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your water source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now add your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done an episode a while back on the
order in which I recommend you mix your
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to that if you haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix it really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got that pump in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a big container,
if you're using a five gallon bucket,
[SPEAKER_00]: you got a stick or something, you're
stirring it up real well, maybe a piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: PVC plumbing or a piece of PVC pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mix it up really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got all your nutrients in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're almost ready to water, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then just simply stick a pH pen or a pH
meter in there and check the pH of that
[SPEAKER_00]: solution before you water it into your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's too low, add a few drops of pH up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's too high, add a few drops of pH
down and keep measuring until you get it
[SPEAKER_00]: dialed in where you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go slowly when adding drops, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will change quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll put in, if it's, so let's say that
you're at fucking 7.2, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're trying to get to 6.3.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll put in a couple drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll put in a couple drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll go to 7.1.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll put in a couple more and it goes to
6.9.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you let it chill for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put in two more drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be at 6.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about why later in the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful when you're adding drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to change quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, do not get the pH up or down
solution on your skin or in your eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff is terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear gloves if you're clumsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always wear gloves when you're mixing
nutrients, especially when handling the pH
[SPEAKER_00]: up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear goggles if you're clumsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend doing it all the time anyway,
but some of you are stubborn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep in mind the pH up and down
can burn the living shit out of your eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the temperature of your water will
affect the pH of your solution as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to adjust the pH of really cold
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will frustrate the shit out of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it warms up, the solution
will be way off in pH and you'll have to
[SPEAKER_00]: go back at it all over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let the water get to 69 to 75 degrees
before you try to adjust it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Closer to 72, 75 will be better for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: 69 would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the lowest I would go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't feed cold water to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I describe it as stick your fucking feet
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to put your feet in that
water?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, your plants probably don't want their
roots in it either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your balls in there and see what you
think.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna go, oh God, and you're gonna
pull them out real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the plants do when you feed
them with water that cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that shit to your plants,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down the pH of your solution that
you're feeding into your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're checking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just grab a pen and write it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of you probably have a dry erase
board or a clipboard or some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: notebook or a note in your phone,
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please just write down the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna help us in the future should
we notice problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you've got the equipment,
write down the EC or the PPMs of that feed
[SPEAKER_00]: solution if you've got that meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're gonna go buy a meter,
I would consider getting the EC or the PPM
[SPEAKER_00]: meter while you're at it if you're really
gonna devote your time and energy to
[SPEAKER_00]: growing high quality cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got a big bucket of water and
it's been pH adjusted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got our nutrients in there and it's
ready to go and it's at the correct
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now water your plants thoroughly and let
some of the water run out of the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jorge taught us that we want the water to
be abundant but not excessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water till some runs out and then let
it dry up a little bit and then water them
[SPEAKER_00]: when you feel like it's time for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants will let you know when it's
time to water them again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water them on your cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let me interrupt your cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what you're doing but let the water be
abundant but not excessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have some come running out of the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having a little bit of water run out of
the bottom has a lot of benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about more of that in a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to get really detailed,
catch some of that water coming out of
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants and document the pH and the
EC of that water that comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got what's going in and what's
going out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we notice problems in the future,
we can use that information to help us
[SPEAKER_00]: diagnose our issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you've got a large crop and you've
got thousands of plants, this really comes
[SPEAKER_00]: in handy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a good practice to start now,
especially if you plan on getting into the
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial industry in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get comfortable with these devices and
with this type of note taking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, maybe get used to using a Google
document because that's how I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: make you do it if you work in one of my
facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep all of the pH charts on a Google
doc so that I can see it wherever I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other workers can open it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can throw in the information that's
needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We type down the nutrients that were put
in, the pH, the EC, the temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: what time it was done, how many gallons
were mixed and who did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Goes on to every feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So document all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can identify problems in the
future and it makes accountability for
[SPEAKER_00]: when there's more than one person working
in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't need a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to catch some runoff,
you can just use a little tiny cup or a
[SPEAKER_00]: small container, something that catches
enough water for you to put your pH meter
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need enough to cover the probe
and see what the pH is, possibly see what
[SPEAKER_00]: the EC is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just catch a little water, maybe gather
two different containers from two
[SPEAKER_00]: different plants at the end of the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll figure that one out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure if you're going to do this,
you're smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're smart enough to figure that part
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people are going to want to
measure the pH of the medium, the soil or
[SPEAKER_00]: the cocoa after they water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's constantly changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will change as that medium dries out
and changes temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to constantly be changing from
the minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little bit dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at one pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: The minute the water hits, changing pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're done watering, already
starting to change pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time you get the probe in there,
different pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always going to be changing in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a little environment happening
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expected to change and it's going to
work to your advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This slight shift, I wrote down the word
swing, but I don't want to say swing this
[SPEAKER_00]: slight shift in pH and the rhizosphere
will make more nutrients available to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and keep stimulating your plants to
eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So earlier we talked about some of the
plants are more available on a high pH
[SPEAKER_00]: range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are more available on a low pH range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now you're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about a 0.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking like a 0.2, a 0.1,
maybe a 0.3 change in our rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't obsess over the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of your medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't done anything crazy or
added anything crazy in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you haven't seen any problems,
the pH of your soil or your medium is just
[SPEAKER_00]: fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will only need to be adjusted if you've
done something to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's talk about pH pens and
meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sponsored by any equipment
company, but I use the Blue Lab meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all seem to have a short lifespan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, every meter I've bought,
every brand I've bought several brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried several different companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all seem to have a very limited
lifespan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those pen type that they're just little
looks like a little pen, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how it looks like a large
pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like a pregnancy test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those all have a very limited lifespan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's grower fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I think it's just they're not
super.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they want them to last a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they want us to have to buy a new
one to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make money off of us by doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like the Blue Lab meters,
but you have to keep any no matter what pH
[SPEAKER_00]: meter you buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to keep the probes wet or it will
die.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it dries, it dies is what they should
teach you at the grow store.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't tell you that because then
it dies and you have to buy a replacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you keep that wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you keep it covered if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I like to do, what we do with the
large grow, we've got a large container,
[SPEAKER_00]: put some water in there and then set the
pH pens in there to where all the probes
[SPEAKER_00]: are in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all just sitting in a circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the morning when everybody
comes, they can just grab their pen,
[SPEAKER_00]: put the cap on it, then go work for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those pens will stay moist with
the caps on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can check the solution as their
day goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they don't have to go wander around
and try to find a pH pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to have enough pH pens for
everybody in the facilities if we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, they break, they die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit happens with these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if they're dying because of
the guys or if they're dying just because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what these things do because my
personal pens have died also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to think I take good care of my
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, you have to keep your probe clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you expect to rely on your equipment,
you have to take good care of your
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep the probe clean on your pH meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also calibrate your meters regularly
depending on how much you're using it,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on how much you're knocking it
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure you're cleaning it and
calibrating it on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to go for about once a week,
maybe every two weeks at the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: A home grower, maybe you could get away
with once a month, but I wouldn't press my
[SPEAKER_00]: luck too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find a decent pH pen for around 40
bucks or you can find a magnificent pH
[SPEAKER_00]: monitoring device with an EC meter and a
thermometer on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably going to cost you closer to
250 maybe 350.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can spend up to $1,000 on pH
monitoring equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to, you can get a device
that you can put all of your nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: bottles into this thing and you can put
your pH up and down and you can tell it
[SPEAKER_00]: how much PPMs of each bottle you want
poured into the mix and then it'll pH it
[SPEAKER_00]: for you and it'll feed the plants for you
if you really want to spend that money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you just want to get a pH pen,
you can spend around 40, maybe 80 bucks
[SPEAKER_00]: will get you a really good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like I'm saying if you want to go
high end and get the combo, go ahead and
[SPEAKER_00]: spend 250, 350 on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more you spend, the better they are
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some equipment, the more you spend,
you're just getting a better name or a
[SPEAKER_00]: better color.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like with scientific equipment
like pH monitors and such, you actually do
[SPEAKER_00]: get better stuff when you spend a little
bit more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can drop the extra cash on a
good pH meter, I recommend doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're old school, you can use the
paper and the drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of work and kind of a pain in
the ass to me, but it does work and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: reliable and you never have to calibrate
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said before I like the pH or the Blue
Lab combo meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pH, EC and temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have all kinds of suggestions on
how to adjust your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend you actually buy a pH or pH
down product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using high end nutrients with a lot
of buffers in them, a lot of chelation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using expensive plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're running expensive crops,
running expensive lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're expecting high output yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's use something reliable and stable to
adjust our pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go using some home remedy because
our nutrients are going to wash that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our nutrients are going to eat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to evaporate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then our pH is going to swing like crazy
because we didn't use the proper products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So use something reliable to stabilize
your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So checking and adjusting the pH of your
feed solution should become a habit and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll see the difference in your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good idea to periodically check the
pH even if you think you've got your mix
[SPEAKER_00]: dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes your local water company will
change the amount of chemicals or the type
[SPEAKER_00]: of chemicals they're using to treat your
water in your area and you will not be
[SPEAKER_00]: aware of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're checking the pH of your
solutions, you will catch these types of
[SPEAKER_00]: things and you can dial it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, maybe your nutrient company made a
change and you're not aware of that
[SPEAKER_00]: because that shit does happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I highly suggest you check and adjust
your pH at every opportunity you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will increase the potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will increase the quality and it will
increase the yield of your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who doesn't want more potent,
better tasting herb?
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, who doesn't want more of
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my quick talk on adjusting your
pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should talk a little bit about the pH
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are going to talk about
how far off can 0.1 or 0.2 be.
[SPEAKER_00]: How big of a difference can that make when
adjusting pH?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just 0.1.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't sound like that big of a deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I told you it's $1.10 or $1.20 or
$1.30, 10, 30 cents probably isn't going
[SPEAKER_00]: to make much of a difference to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But pH is measured on a very unique scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a scale called, and I hope I
pronounce this correctly, the logarithmic
[SPEAKER_00]: scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do my best to explain this.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Wikipedia, it takes about seven pages
to explain the logarithmic scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, you guys, I am attempting to
condense seven pages of Wikipedia into
[SPEAKER_00]: about three sentences here, so follow me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And please don't be too critical of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to give you an idea of why
it's so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: The logarithmic scale and the way pH works
is basically an exponent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you have a pH of six, let's just
start with the number six, 6.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have got six, all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if we move to 6.1, basically every
time you move a number up, you are adding
[SPEAKER_00]: a zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 6.0 is 6.0, 6.1 is 6.10, 6.2 is 6.200,
6.3 is 6.3000, 6.4 is 6.40000,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it keeps going like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not just moving one,
you are moving an exponent of one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could see the math scale that is
happening, the equation that's happening
[SPEAKER_00]: in that pH pin the entire time,
you would understand how far off each 0.1
[SPEAKER_00]: adjustment takes us from the original
starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that may not be the most scientific
explanation, but I think it makes it more
[SPEAKER_00]: understandable for the audience to catch
on of why it's so critical to stay as
[SPEAKER_00]: close as we can to our dialed in target
pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I hope that makes
sense to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for listening to this
