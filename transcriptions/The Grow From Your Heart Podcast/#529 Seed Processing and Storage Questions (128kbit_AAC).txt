[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I like to start this podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Blackberry
Banana Kush live batter from our friends
[SPEAKER_03]: at Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the package, the label says this
contains 68.4% THC and 77.9% total
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: This stuff gets me stoned, but my favorite
part is that flavor and aroma.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to crack it open right now and
give it a good smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like blackberry jam.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has definitely got that funky
blackberry sweet tartness going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then when I dab it, that blackberry hits
you first, then you get that banana flavor
[SPEAKER_03]: in the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it is really delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: The banana is subtle, but it is just
enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously it has gotten me stoned and
rambly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is great podcast concentrates.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've smoked most of the jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've probably got one fat dab left.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do approve.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to my friends at Apothecary
Farms for the Blackberry Banana Kush
[SPEAKER_03]: batter.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,

[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys for all of the continued
support.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're watching on video, you may
notice I've got this new fancy earpiece.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not using the giant earphones today,
the giant headphones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of getting adjusted to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds different to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So excuse me if I do sound kind of off a
couple of times.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got one ear with a mic, one ear with
the earbud in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: One ear is open.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's new to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Feels different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me if I sound funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just playing with new gear.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get a lapel mic, make the
videos a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, if you haven't paid attention
yet, I have been making videos.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the new podcasts are available on
a video platform.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can find us on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you check out the videos.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're not able to watch on YouTube,
don't feel bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically me staring into a screen
and Mike staring into a screen and us
[SPEAKER_03]: having a chat or just my pretty face
smiling at a screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's keep this show on track here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's not get too far lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a couple of good notes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wrote down in really big letters,
the letters L E D.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, I was sent some lights from our
friends at black sale market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to my good friend,
Keith.
[SPEAKER_03]: He makes amazing lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a fucking well spoken, well educated
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: And his product is rock solid.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been running his lights for a few.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember exactly how long the
plants are in three gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they've been transplanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've spent their entire lives under
these LEDs and they look amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are short.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are squat.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are stout.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are very compact.
[SPEAKER_03]: The node spacing from these LEDs is very
tight.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not a lot of distance between
branches and node spacing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of very healthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And vigorous leaf growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm impressed so far with the
performance of my Canon LEDs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have two in a five by five tent and they
are kicking ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got seedlings in there that are brand
new, that are from another breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what to expect from those.
[SPEAKER_03]: They look beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got clones in there, which I have
grown several times.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know exactly what to expect from those.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they look beautiful under these
lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are only in veg so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, I just put them into three
gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're new.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plants are new.
[SPEAKER_03]: The lights are new.
[SPEAKER_03]: So far in, I am very excited and very
impressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plants are eating a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not getting as much heat.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I'm probably not pulling as
much electricity because it's not as hot
[SPEAKER_03]: in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll find out at the end of the month
when the light bill comes, but so far I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: So big shout out to my buddy Keith and big
shout out to Black Sale Market for the
[SPEAKER_03]: Canon LEDs.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are kicking ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most importantly, the plants look happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really what matters.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm satisfied and excited by the growth
I'm getting from those plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So guys, I did not set a timer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to set a timer real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're watching me play with my phone,
I'm not being rude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how long I've been recording.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a good guess, but now we're going
to set a real stopwatch so that we can
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's keep the show on the rails.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, I'm telling you, this Blackberry
Banana Kush has got me stoned as shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: This new earbud hanging out of my ear is
distracting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm going to do two earbuds in the
next episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to feel better.
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be some experimentation
happening, trying to keep the show fresh
[SPEAKER_03]: into you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for joining us, for joining me
this time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are we going to go from here?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a great message.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one came from my YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do answer some of the questions I find
in the YouTube comments.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, it is more convenient for me if
you send me your questions, comments,
[SPEAKER_03]: and concerns via email.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got a cannabis culture or
cannabis cultivation question,
[SPEAKER_03]: my email address is growfromyourheart at
hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the easiest way to get your
question on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can print that and then I can pull that
paper and I can set it here in a pile.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a pile of emails, which I read
from that makes it much easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got the YouTube stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to capture a screenshot and then
honestly that gets lost in all my photos
[SPEAKER_03]: in my phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really find those as easily.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I'm complaining about technology
problems, but still send me an email.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be much easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got a better chance.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I did like this question enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw this one on YouTube and it caught my
eye.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought we would address this here on
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is from YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a comment left.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, also follow me on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're not, go to YouTube search for
the grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Leave some comments on the videos.
[SPEAKER_03]: Subscribe to the channel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Join us, be part of the gang.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one comes from YouTube and it goes
like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo Rasta Jeff, great show.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the steps you take after
processing your fresh seeds, dry time and
[SPEAKER_03]: or fridge time to make them a high
germination ratio?
[SPEAKER_03]: Any info would be greatly appreciated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a lot of good answers and a lot
of good rambles for this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to start with quality seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're asking steps I take after
processing to ensure high germination
[SPEAKER_03]: ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: That high germination ratio was ensured
much longer way before this situation,
[SPEAKER_03]: way before harvest ever started,
way before we were processing seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure you understand that you've got to
have proper pollination time.
[SPEAKER_03]: The females have to be at the right
ovulation period.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to be at their peak.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to pollinate them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to use quality pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: The male has to be dumping a lot of
pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to time the male and female.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every strain wants pollinated at a
different time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've got to pollinate them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you've got to feed them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you've got to keep them under quality
lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't let them get too shaded.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't let them get malnourished.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to take good care of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you have to have quality genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to know that the plants you were
breeding with produce quality seeds,
[SPEAKER_03]: which also produce quality phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is the first step to, not even the
first, there are more steps before that,
[SPEAKER_03]: but when we're making seeds, those are
some of the first steps to quality control
[SPEAKER_03]: and making sure that we get good
germination ratios.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I'll just talk, I'll kind of talk
mainly about how I harvest the seeds and
[SPEAKER_03]: then we'll talk about the processing and
then we'll talk about the storage and all
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just make it all one big talk
because that way I'm making sure to cover
[SPEAKER_03]: everything for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's how I do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I know the plants are going to be
ready to harvest, I take off all of the
[SPEAKER_03]: big leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep in mind, I am talking about
harvesting, ouch, I'm harvesting a seeded
[SPEAKER_03]: crop at this time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything we're harvesting in this lesson
is loaded with seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So focus on the seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not harvesting for buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a different scenario.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I know it's almost harvest time,
I go and take off all the leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me get my brain back on track.
[SPEAKER_03]: I pull off all the leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: I defoliate all that big leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just pull it off, throw it on the floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll sweep up later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get all the leaves out of there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then chop the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Label each plant because I've got multiple
strains in the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: There might be four or five different
strains in there because I may have
[SPEAKER_03]: crossed one male to four or five different
females.
[SPEAKER_03]: That way we can have a nice variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually three or four familiar things and
one brand new things.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to make a cross,
why not experiment a little bit?
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you got seeds to sell and then you
got freebies to give out.
[SPEAKER_03]: People can play with and see if they're
worth the shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll pollinate, defoliate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we cut them down, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We've cut down the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're well labeled.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're hanging.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I let them get crispy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I don't even hang them depending
on the amount of space I've got,
[SPEAKER_03]: depending on what's available.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to put them in a big, it's a rubber
made, it's a storage container that's
[SPEAKER_03]: meant to slide under the bed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't put the lid on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I cut the plant down, lay it right in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I stack them crisscross to where
they're a long way this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I turn it long way this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: They stacked where they don't,
the buds don't crush each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're stacked container to container,
but nothing's touching the buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: The edges of the containers hold them up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure you understand the boxes
crisscross.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've got plants in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're well labeled.
[SPEAKER_03]: I let those sit.
[SPEAKER_03]: For several days.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need them to dry or cure in any
special conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: They sit in a spare room.
[SPEAKER_03]: They sit in a bedroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: They sit wherever there's space.
[SPEAKER_03]: My life is chaotic.
[SPEAKER_03]: I play drums.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a lot of gear, so there's shit
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: They sit until they're dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got some that have been sitting for
probably 10 days now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm waiting for them to get dusty dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to clean my garage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's really going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's quarantine time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's come time to clean the garage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once it's clean, I will go out there and I
will sort those seats.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the way I will do it, I will grab the
sticks and I will pull the stick out of
[SPEAKER_03]: the buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just grab the sticks and put my hand
around the stock and just pull to where
[SPEAKER_03]: all the bud material, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was gross.
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the bud material will land in that
Rubbermaid or that Tupperware dish,
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever brand it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It lands in that container, which it was
stored in for a little while, just
[SPEAKER_03]: chilling there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I've got just a bunch of dry crumbly
buds in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the sticks have been removed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I will put on gloves.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm probably already wearing gloves at
this point and I'll crumble it up real
[SPEAKER_03]: small.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just roll my hands through it and just rub
it until it just crumbles up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to make basically, I don't put a
lot of pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep in mind, I'm not trying to crush
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: The buds are so dry that it's just going
to crumble.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put it in the container, roll it around
with my hands, crumble it real fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to get out most of the small sticks
by doing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You find all the little stems,
the bud stems.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want sticks left in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I take all of that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want bud material and seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once I'm pretty confident I've got bud
material and seeds, I pour that into a
[SPEAKER_03]: gallon baggie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I roll that around a little bit more
to crush it up a little finer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it sounds like I'm just destroying
all the weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: All I want out of here is the seeds,
the weed gets put into the Bokashi bucket.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets recycled.
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes into the compost bin.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't consume that cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not worth it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The seeds do just fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have to worry about losing that
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no loss.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew it all for seed anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I've got dust in a baggie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right at the bottom of the baggie is a
bunch of seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the top is a bunch of, we call it
chaff, the stuff you're going to toss out.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the hemp industry, that's been labeled
chaff.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a machine called an Easy Grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an easy seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what it's called?
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to give them a proper shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Easy seed sorter.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great device.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a little costly, but it was well
worth it for the amount of time and energy
[SPEAKER_03]: that it saved me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I basically pour that bag of crushed up
flour material along with the seeds right
[SPEAKER_03]: into one side of this machine.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a fan in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got two angled different aluminum
doors basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: That fan blows the heavy shit one way.
[SPEAKER_03]: It falls one way and the light shit blows
another way.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get two trays.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you pull out the drawers at the
bottom, there's seeds in one and there's
[SPEAKER_03]: chaff in the other.
[SPEAKER_03]: I run it a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_03]: I separate it and I run it a couple of
times because I'm a cheap ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to lose any seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also want to clean all the small shit
out of there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll learn how to, if you get that
machine, you'll learn a nice rhythm and
[SPEAKER_03]: how to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll work well the first time you do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you kind of pre-clean your seeds,
I just run it a couple of times and I've
[SPEAKER_03]: got a nice rhythm.
[SPEAKER_03]: It works really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make it work for you, but it's a great
machine.
[SPEAKER_03]: The easy seed sorter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I run my seeds through there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I clean them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at this point, now we've got material
and we've got seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I usually have either small mason jars or
big baggies of seeds, depending on how
[SPEAKER_03]: many seeds there are, depending on what
strain it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, some seeds don't stick around long.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some seeds I can store and keep around and
kind of hoard a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we've got seeds in containers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I let them sit out until they're dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I leave them in the jars with the lids
open until I know that those seeds are
[SPEAKER_03]: dry, but I also know that they have sat
out for 10 to 12, maybe 14 or 15 days
[SPEAKER_03]: before I even got around to getting them
out of the buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm sure that these seeds are dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need them to dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Moisture is your enemy when it comes to
seed storage.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I make sure they're dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell when I'm playing with the
material.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell when I'm sorting them how dry
it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're too soft, if they're too moist,
they'll be too sticky.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be able to tell.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I need them dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I will put the lid on them or I will
seal the baggie.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's only a few hundred,
I'll put them in a baggie.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like a small, you guys, the little two
by three baggies.
[SPEAKER_03]: My stash goes in those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I put that stash in another airtight
container.
[SPEAKER_03]: My seeds that are for me personally go
store, get stored in a safe in the bottom
[SPEAKER_03]: of the, you don't even know exactly where
it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in a cool, dark, dry space,
but that's a really nice environment for,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like a low refrigerated area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically it's a naturally cool
environment and it's in a safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing gets to there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's dark, not a lot of air movement.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my seeds are in a cool, dry,
dark environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to know what I do, how,
after I process them to keep a high
[SPEAKER_03]: germination rate, I make sure they're dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're asking about dry time.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to depend on environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to depend on where you are,
but make sure they're dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably 10 to 14 days is enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get them out of the buds, let them sit
in a tray for a few more days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure that that's dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Separate all the material, feel it,
make sure that that's dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you said fridge time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have got a room in my house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, a basement is the ideal space.
[SPEAKER_03]: A basement naturally stays cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I live in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: My basement is naturally cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's hot as shit upstairs, if it's cold
as shit downstairs, it is naturally
[SPEAKER_03]: perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: About 72, 74, maybe 68, 69 degrees in the
basement.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's real cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll get kind of chilly down there,
but the seeds dig the cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they stay in a safe in the basement.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking nice down there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where I store them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They either go in mason jars or in
baggies, depending on how many seeds there
[SPEAKER_03]: are, depending on how quickly they sell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I package them up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to get, I make about a hundred packs
of whichever strain I'm going to work
[SPEAKER_03]: with.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just seems efficient.
[SPEAKER_03]: Depending on, it's about a hundred.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do about 60 and 30.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's about 90.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sheets of labels I work with come in
60.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you get 60 and 90.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just depends on how I'm feeling,
how frisky I am and how many I need,
[SPEAKER_03]: how many of the vendors are taken.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then I package them up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably too many details you don't
need to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I package them up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those seeds get stored in a really chill
area.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's dark.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no moisture.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no people in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no lights coming on and it's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most importantly, those seeds stay fairly
cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't want to get hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what will slow them down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Light and moisture will also slow them
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they just stay in a cool area in the
basement.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not refrigerated, but it doesn't need
to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just ambiently cool and they're
packaged up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That way I don't, if I do get an order and
somebody needs them, I don't have to
[SPEAKER_03]: scramble and try to get them together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeds here now is called seeds here now
because they'll get you seeds here now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I try to be part of that seeds here
now chain, try to be quick, try to be on
[SPEAKER_03]: top of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not a real technical process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure they're dry before you store
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is the most important part.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then keep them dry and cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can put them, if your own personal
stash of seeds can be stored in something
[SPEAKER_03]: dark and dry, make sure it's dry and
sealed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want it sealed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe double seal it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe seal it, put it in something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you can store them in the crisper
drawer of your refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't prefer to freeze them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Freezing will give you the opportunity for
the seeds may rupture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, you get the opportunity for
condensation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time you take them out of the
freezer, the temperature inside that seed
[SPEAKER_03]: changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The temperature in the container changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Condensation may happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't need to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you are taking your seeds in and out
to show them off, keep them just in the
[SPEAKER_03]: fridge.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to show off some of your seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people are seed collectors.
[SPEAKER_03]: I encourage that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seedsherenow.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that is the gist of what we
have to say, what steps you take after
[SPEAKER_03]: processing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I told you basically my processing
process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dry time, it's probably 10 to 14 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fridge time, they're just stored in a
cool, dry environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And honestly, the key to successful
germination and successful healthy seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: is good quality breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you breed properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you feed those plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure they get the right light.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure you guys have heard me talk about
putting my plants back on an 18-6 light
[SPEAKER_03]: cycle after pollination.
[SPEAKER_03]: That ensures really big fat seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're getting more light.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're getting more energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are going to say 18-6 and flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, 18-6 and flower after they're
pollinated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care what the buds look like.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want healthy seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: My buds look like shit when they're done.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kill those buds and throw them away.
[SPEAKER_03]: We pull the seeds out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, I am super rambly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope I answered your question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I answered that question super
thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to my friend Terp Monster on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would appreciate it if everybody else
out there gives us a follow on the YouTube
[SPEAKER_03]: channel.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am making these YouTube videos.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me know what you think.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting more comfortable.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to buy more gear and do it more
often.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Terp Monster.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: This message comes from our friend who
calls himself Papa Wheelie.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've heard from Papa Wheelie before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for joining us again on the
show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of this is private.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to skip over that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me roll through there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Scan, scan, scan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've grown some prana and lemon sunrise in
the past, and I loved them both.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love hearing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are great strains to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: A good variety there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Prana's got that funky, almost a head
shop, sort of an incense-y kind of a
[SPEAKER_03]: smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then lemon sunrise, of course,
is just straight lemon terps and lemon
[SPEAKER_03]: pledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: So good variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, I've grown those in the past and
I loved them both.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad they were successful for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes on to say, if something middle of
the road is an option that helps with
[SPEAKER_03]: anxiety, or at least isn't going to make
me dig around in my head too much,
[SPEAKER_03]: what would be the most beneficial for me
to grow right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a really good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've spoken about anxiety and strains for
anxiety previously, and I'm sure again in
[SPEAKER_03]: the future on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to grow something from my line
that is a little less on the anxiety side,
[SPEAKER_03]: I would probably recommend orangegasm,
Michelangelo, or Sunkiss.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are all from the Platinum Tangy
Cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to our friends Maddie and
Spence at Garden of Weedon for amazing
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding on that Platinum Tangy project.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love my Platinum Tangy cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It grows beautifully.
[SPEAKER_03]: I breed that to several other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've made the Michelangelo from there,
that is Platinum Tangy, to the blueberry
[SPEAKER_03]: cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've made the orangegasm, that is Platinum
Tangy, to the Golden Goat, and I've made
[SPEAKER_03]: Sunkiss, which is Platinum Tangy,
to my Arise.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would recommend any of those three out
of my line to keep you well medicated and
[SPEAKER_03]: not get you too deep into your head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something about that orange turp really
makes me, makes most people smiley and
[SPEAKER_03]: happy and less anxious than many other of
the cannabinoids and turps out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the orange flavored stuff is going
to work very well for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want something that is not from my
line, I would recommend Jilly Bean.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also got that really orange flavored
turp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jilly Bean seeds should be available.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may even be able to find them at
SeedsHereNow.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are made by Miss Jill Genetics,
and those are definitely available.
[SPEAKER_03]: You will be able to find Jilly Bean
crosses, if not straight Jilly Bean,
[SPEAKER_03]: at SeedsHereNow.com under the Miss Jill
Genetics tab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would also recommend something like
Agent Orange.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you'll be able to find
Agent Orange, but that Agent Orange or
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe an orange velvet, something with the
orange in the turps, maybe an orange
[SPEAKER_03]: creamsicle, something like that is going
to work well for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to stick with my line, but I also
know that sometimes you can't have access
[SPEAKER_03]: to my stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look for that Jilly Bean or maybe Orange
Gas would be the first two I would
[SPEAKER_03]: recommend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now there is more to this message.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to keep on going.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, you really are the best podcast
out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are upbeat, polite, relevant,
and the quality of your sound equipment
[SPEAKER_03]: makes other shows unlistenable to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope I didn't ruin it for all of the
other podcasts out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have a couple of friends that do a
great show that's got great audio quality,
[SPEAKER_03]: so I hope you give them a chance also.
[SPEAKER_03]: Upbeat.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to be upbeat, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in a good mood.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about cannabis here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I shouldn't be angry.
[SPEAKER_03]: This fucking weed plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: No way, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm upbeat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Polite.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm usually polite.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did just say the F word, but I try to
stay polite.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got respect.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just that kind of guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Relevant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I don't write a book.
[SPEAKER_03]: This kind of started off, somebody said
that I should write a book, and I was
[SPEAKER_03]: like, that book would be outdated by the
time I got done publishing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I was like, podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: So relevant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to stay relevant.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we do the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: The information can be updated weekly.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I say something today and I learn
information when I sign out of here and I
[SPEAKER_03]: can go, oh shit, and then I can press
record again and I can say, hey guys,
[SPEAKER_03]: I learned new techniques.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yesterday I said, don't ever do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today I have discovered reasons why we
should do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've held myself accountable on the
show before and updated my opinions and
[SPEAKER_03]: info.
[SPEAKER_03]: So staying relevant is very important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad that you find me to be relevant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting to be an older guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's good to know that I'm fucking
relevant.
[SPEAKER_03]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sound quality of my equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of an audio nerd.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started off, I've been a traveling
musician, a touring musician, a recording
[SPEAKER_03]: musician.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a lot of toys and to not sound
good drives me crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't listen to some podcasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got a guest call in on a phone,
on your podcast, there's a good chance I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: skipping that episode, which I know is
hypocritical because I do get Mike up here
[SPEAKER_03]: on Zoom.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like the Zoom shows are better.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought him equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not bragging that I bought him shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm saying I bought him equipment to
make him sound good.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not using the damn phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad that you noticed that the
equipment sounds good today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm experimenting with this new earbud.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need two earbuds for next time,
but we can fix that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we'll work on the lapel mics.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys can see my stylish iRegenetics
t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't even see that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to do a few upgrades and I
promise I'll keep the sound coming well.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the sound starts slipping with the new
gear, please Papa Willie, I look forward
[SPEAKER_03]: to you letting me know that I'm slipping.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just send me a message and say,
hey, bro, the sound kind of bites right
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll get it back up to speed.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wraps this one up.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll thank you in person if you come out
to New England again sometime soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a lot of friends inviting me out
to the New England area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe time for a Rasta Jeff Boston Freedom
Rally trip or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go see all my asshole friends out there on
the coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go hang out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go spend some time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go eat some good food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Might be almost time for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Papa Willie, I want to thank you for
the great message.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for always supporting the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got any more questions,
please send me more emails.
