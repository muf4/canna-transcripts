[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back podcast world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode 871 of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: In today's episode, we're going to talk
about watering our plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get to that part of the show,
let me remind you to use coupon code
[SPEAKER_01]: IRIARMY at acinfinity.com to save 10% off
your entire purchase.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, now let's jump into the
question and answer portion of today's
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how you can win free seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a website.
[SPEAKER_01]: That website is irigenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the top of that website, there is a row
of tabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those tabs does say Grow Help or
Grow Questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Click on that little tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me a Grow Question.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I read your Grow Question here on the
podcast, I will send you a coupon code for
[SPEAKER_01]: a free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first question on today's podcast came
from the Grow Help tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came from our new friend who wants to
be called Lone Wolf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the party Lone Wolf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, Rasta Jeff, what are your
thoughts on cheap water meters?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got two for 12 bucks on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably got what you paid for,
to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheap shit on Amazon is cheap shit on
Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, I'll teach you a way to get away
from this water meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not even going to need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Save somebody else two for 12 in the
future here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it says, I have had a bad problem with
over watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the first step is water less,
my dude, but I'm going to give you more
[SPEAKER_01]: details.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let me just troll you right here on
the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I'm hoping this will solve it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part two, I guess, is a good,
what is a good set of nutrients for a
[SPEAKER_01]: beginner grower and how often to use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me talk first about, let me put a
little star and make sure I get to the
[SPEAKER_01]: second part here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a two part question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me address the first part of this
question here, because this is the part
[SPEAKER_01]: that really needs some help.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are my thoughts on cheap water
meters?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't use any sort of water meter in a
small home grow and a medium sized
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe in a gigantic, really large
facility, I would have moisture meters
[SPEAKER_01]: placed strategically to let me know if
there's an emergency and something gets
[SPEAKER_01]: too dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a personal home grow, I don't ever
use a moisture meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done another full episode that is
titled water tech one through five.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to kind of reiterate quickly
water tech one through five here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully this will give you a
breakdown on how to successfully water
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants without over watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mean to be a troll.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mean to be a smart ass,
but I am a smart ass and kind of a troll.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's how it's going to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're over watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just cut back a little bit on the
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the first step, but this will apply
for everybody out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This may be helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use a method called one through five
watering tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about if you load your pot,
your container, whatever size it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's a fabric pot, if it's a plastic
pot and whatever medium you're putting in
[SPEAKER_01]: there, if you're putting in cocoa,
if you're putting in soilless mix,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're putting in soil, living soil,
whatever goes in here, stuff that pot the
[SPEAKER_01]: way that you would fill it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put that plant in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got that plant in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no water in there at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it be completely dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a hypothetical situation at this
point right now with no water in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That plant is at what we call a one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is one on the moisture scale one
through five.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are at a level one on that moisture,
completely dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we don't water that plant almost
immediately, it will die.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is level one on moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember how heavy that pot is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now with no moisture in there,
pick it up, feel it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This pot, when you go to pick it up,
you're going to lift it and you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to go, oh shit, you're going to throw it
up in the air because it's way light
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's no moisture in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is level one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm going to go all the way to level
five and then you'll see where I'm going
[SPEAKER_01]: and we'll work our way into the middle of
this scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Level five would be if I took a five
gallon bucket of water and I watered the
[SPEAKER_01]: shit out of this new transplanted pot and
we let that all that dirt, all that medium
[SPEAKER_01]: cocoa, whatever we're using inside that
pot, fully saturate that bad bitch to the
[SPEAKER_01]: point of runoff where water is running out
of the bottom of that container.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a number five.
[SPEAKER_01]: So number one, then pick it up at this
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pick it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: See how much that weighs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be heavy as shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a three gallon, a five
gallon, a seven, especially if it's any
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger, it's going to be hard to pick up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's loaded with water and a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be quite heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that soil is saturated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember that weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, God, that's heavy right there,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then that light shit when you almost threw
the pot, that's a number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's work our way through this scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go backwards from number five
because we've now at this point in our
[SPEAKER_01]: hypothetical, we have saturated this
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is nice and wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on a number five scale, that plant is
what we're going to call flooded.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as wet as it can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a big plant, if your plants
in a three gallon pot, it's well
[SPEAKER_01]: established, got a root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hopefully water that plant to a
level five, get it to runoff and it will
[SPEAKER_01]: be okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let it sit in the runoff,
but water to that runoff and it will be
[SPEAKER_01]: okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is level five.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fully saturated.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that plant sits in that for too long,
we may see issues, but if you've got a
[SPEAKER_01]: well established plant, you should be able
to water to runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a smaller plant,
we've got to adjust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about however big your container is,
how much space are the roots taking?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's kind of water the roots and then a
little bit more to encourage growth,
[SPEAKER_01]: but don't flood that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your plants are a little smaller,
maybe you want to stick with the level
[SPEAKER_01]: four or a level three, which is what we're
going to work our way into next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Level five is flooded.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's as wet as that shit can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember how heavy that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's level five.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't get any wetter than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water is pouring out of the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may see droopy plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may see a little bit of claw.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is over watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the plant starts yellowing out when you
do this, you're over watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're little, like I said,
water a little bit less, work your way to
[SPEAKER_01]: a four or a three.
[SPEAKER_01]: So number four is when level five dries
out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't see as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: The top still appears a little bit wet,
but not super dark, and it's a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: lighter now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pick that pot up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel that weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: That plant should look real happy at this
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be like, oh, I'm not over
watered.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got enough saturation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got enough oxygen in my root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thriving.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about a level four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on the size of your pots,
how big your plants are, level five to
[SPEAKER_01]: level four could take, if you're in a
three gallon cocoa pot with a big plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: could be a couple of hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in a seven gallon pot with a
soilless mix, that four to five could be
[SPEAKER_01]: half of a day to take it to get from that
and from that one moisture level to the
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just pay attention to the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pick them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you got to understand that the
different types of medium and the size of
[SPEAKER_01]: pot and the environment, the size of
plant, this is all going to come into play
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So adjust as necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: But your smaller plants, keep them at that
level four.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's wet, but not flooded, saturated,
but not fucking fully dripping and dunked
[SPEAKER_01]: with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's four or five, that wet area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Level three is when those plants are
praying.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got that perfect level of the top
is not showing any water, but the middle
[SPEAKER_01]: of the root zone is nice and saturated.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a level three.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right about where we want to hover
when those plants look real good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we've got to start paying attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to keep an eye on level three
because what's next is level two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when those plants start to get
droopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They went from praying and now they've
gone, oh shit, we need some water.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're starting to get a little bit sad,
a little bit droopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you see them doing that droop,
now it's time to really pick them up and
[SPEAKER_01]: see what they weigh because this right
before that droop, just right before that
[SPEAKER_01]: was when you should have watered them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you see that droop, pay attention
to how long it's been since you watered
[SPEAKER_01]: them last time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just a few minutes, maybe a few hours
before that is when you need to water next
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right when you see them going,
I'm sleepy, I'm tired, I need some water,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's when they're thirsty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right when they start to do the droop,
that is when you need to get some water in
[SPEAKER_01]: them as soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is probably be 2.5 is really the
ideal time to water them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can learn to time that,
right before they droop, right after the
[SPEAKER_01]: pray, you'll see some plants won't pray,
but some plants will have their arms up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be like, la la la la la,
I'm super happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some will stay just like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll have their arms almost horizontal,
kind of going up.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you see them start to go down and
droop and get a little bit tired,
[SPEAKER_01]: right before that was when they wanted
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn that time, learn how to identify
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn to pick up that pot and check that
moisture level in that pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably just under three,
just above two.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a 2.5 on this scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right when you're probably going to
want to water them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Level two is when they're droopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going, hey, water, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's level two when they're looking a
little bit like, I should have watered
[SPEAKER_01]: those like a little bit ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I overslept or I got home from Oracle
8 or whatever happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: The concert went long.
[SPEAKER_01]: The comedy show went longer than I had
intended.
[SPEAKER_01]: The drive took longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever could have happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need some water.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the point here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you were doing, these plants
needed some water just a little bit ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So learn that schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then number one, number one is when we're
back at that super dryness.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a plant that has established
a root zone and that medium, the cocoa,
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil, the soil is mixed, whatever
we're playing with.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's reached a level one, it is
probably dead or pretty close to dead at
[SPEAKER_01]: this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So number one is you're fired.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what number one is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number two is water these things pretty
fucking soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number three is we're pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number four is we're wet, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number five is we're fucking saturated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's for a well-established plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to adjust that for
smaller plants, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about the amount of dirt you've got
in that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about how much water to dirt it's
going to take to saturate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water it until it runs off a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got a small container, don't go
flooding that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water it until you just get a couple of
drips out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then stop watering and then don't water
again until it looks like it really needs
[SPEAKER_01]: some water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant will tell you when it starts to
get a little sad, a little bit droopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pick it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stick your finger in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of different ways to tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been checking the moisture on plants
for thousands of years before we even had
[SPEAKER_01]: electricity or moisture content meters or
any of that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, some of the best herb I ever
grew was before we had all these fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: toys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had two magnetic ballasts in a room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing real fancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a Home Depot fan in there blowing
wind around.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that was in there that was
designed to be for a grow were the grow
[SPEAKER_01]: lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything else was just hodgepodge,
put together shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a high pressure sodium light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a metal halide light in that room
and we banged out some of the most potent,
[SPEAKER_01]: most photogenic, most impressive herb I
grew in that time period of my life until
[SPEAKER_01]: I got into commercial cultivation and then
we got the double-ended bulbs and shit
[SPEAKER_01]: went kapow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my point here, I don't even fucking
remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my point.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need all these tools,
all these electric meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the tools within us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can develop these skills to become,
that's a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a farmer right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not having to walk and I can't tell the pH
of a solution without sticking a fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I could stick my finger in the
solution, lick my finger, and go 6.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I could do that, but that's not a
skill I've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how to do that as a human,
but as a person, I can save my time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need to buy another tool by just
observing the plant, like looking at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it perky?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it sad?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it droopy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it bright green?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it dark green?
[SPEAKER_01]: All these things tell me, does it need
water or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it need nutrients or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it need to be up-potted?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it need, I can see if it's too dry,
the humidity, the VPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell, the plant tells me 90% of
these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you watch the plant, and stop relying
on all the fun toys and gadgets and the
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive shit, you'll develop a really
solid relationship with the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll become, that's a true grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is when you're a grower, when you're
not just a Googler and a guy with some
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're actually learning and understanding
like, oh, I see this happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever hypothetical situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't even think one right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I understand that I've grown this
plant enough times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I overfed it something.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because I gave it too much
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can correct that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just start developing that relation with
the relationship with the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tools are great and they're fun,
but a good farmer, a good grower can look
[SPEAKER_01]: and figure the same shit out without
walking all the way over there and picking
[SPEAKER_01]: up my meter and coming back and checking
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could have just went doink and picked it
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Said, that's like a level three.
[SPEAKER_01]: This plant's cool for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll water that in a couple hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Move on to the next plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm rambly as shit today.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dude, where'd your name go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dude, Lone Wolf.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the way you spelled that also.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: He spelled it Lone Wolf, like a loan,
like he's going to give you some money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lone Wolf.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fucking great.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dude Lone Wolf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check your inbox because
you've got a coupon code for a free pack
[SPEAKER_01]: of seeds at iREDirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also check your spam folder because a lot
of you guys, your email thinks I'm spam,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't take it personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'm spammy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I helped you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: One through five water tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a full episode on the YouTube
channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a real video.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like a static image.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think of the logo or something,
but if you want to hear the old episode,
[SPEAKER_01]: listen to both episodes and then leave
comments on this one and let me know what
[SPEAKER_01]: you think of both episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that'll be fun and it'll be
interactive and it'll get me a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it's one good way to fish for
comments out in the open.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, my dude, thank you for the
great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's keep this rambly fucking energy
going here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This question came from the same place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came from the Grow Help tab at
iREGENETICS.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Click on that Grow Help tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me your grow question.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I like your question and I read it here
on the podcast, guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll send you a coupon code for a free
pack of seeds at iREGENETICS.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, right now, if you shop at
iREGENETICS.com, if you spend a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars on seeds, you will get free
shipping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that only applies to the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that applies to the
cuttings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it a try.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put a hundred dollars worth of
product in your shipping cart,
[SPEAKER_01]: the coupon code will auto populate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, let's stay focused, which I don't know
why they call them concentrates because
[SPEAKER_01]: after I smoke concentrates, I can't
fucking concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clip that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody clip that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make that a short.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: This message came from our friend called
Mental Pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude, I get you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This message says, Hey Rasta Jeff,
can you please explain a little bit about
[SPEAKER_01]: your drying and curing method of seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's fun and that's real easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it said your explanations and
knowledge on breeding are second to none
[SPEAKER_01]: and we all appreciate you more than you
will ever know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for all of the knowledge you share
with the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro, thank you for the huge string of
compliments there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, see you at the DGC cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before I get too far, check that inbox
for your coupon code for free seeds at I
[SPEAKER_01]: read direct.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember what I smoked,
but I hope I've got more of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause put me in a good ass mood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is we, where are we the question?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the answer drying and curing of
seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's real easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, before the seeds are done,
um, I, let me remind you that I put the
[SPEAKER_01]: lights on 18 hours on and six hours off to
finish my seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I feel like that may be a little
too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes bigger fatter, beefier, happy,
healthier seeds and they finish more
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got my lights on 18 six.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just a couple of days before harvest,
I will go in there and pull off all as
[SPEAKER_01]: many leaves as I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to strip that room as naked as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be much easier to get the
leaves now than it is after I cut the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, go in there and I'm going to give
you more details than you asked for about
[SPEAKER_01]: harvesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're wanting the drying and curing
method, but this is part of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, go in there and take off all the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the plants naked.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just got a bunch of buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: With seeds protruding out, not a lot of
leaves on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: When harvest day comes, I will get,
and depending on the size of the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: it depends on what I'll use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the time you've heard me talk
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got, they're either Rubbermaid or
Sterlite bins.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are four, maybe five or six inches
deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are 28 or 30 inches long by
probably 15 inches wide, just a little
[SPEAKER_01]: tray, like the big cat litter box.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially it's made so that you could
put clothes in it and stash your clothes
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever shit under the bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not meant to be real high for taking
up space.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes a beautiful tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I use one of those trays per plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way that I will do it is in the
heart, in the flowering room, I will cut
[SPEAKER_01]: down the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's in a trellis net.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll work it out of that net the best we
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut down the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put that plant in that individual Sterlite
bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will take the plant tag out of the
plant, out of the dirt, and clean it off
[SPEAKER_01]: and affix that plant with some duct tape
to the stick of that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that plant is labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever it is, that label stays with it
forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those bins get moved to another area after
I chop down every plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I will hang up those plants with
plenty of space between each one and I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: put the plastic bin underneath it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My reason for this is as those plants
hang, some of those seeds will fall out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times those become table
seeds because I don't want to get confused
[SPEAKER_01]: and not give you the proper seed that is
how it is labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those seeds that fall out, they land on
the floor, they get scooped into a pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are table seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sell those on the website for like a
buck a seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get like 50 of them for 50 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I did 100 table seeds for 50 bucks
during the sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what table seeds are.
[SPEAKER_01]: My seeds that I don't know what the fuck
they are, but they're still really good
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and you guys will enjoy growing
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, I got the plant hanging upside
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hang it upside down until it becomes a
very specific point of dryness.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is very critical in the drying,
curing, and harvesting process.
[SPEAKER_01]: My plants hang upside down.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point I'm not really drying or
curing them, so I'm not super concerned
[SPEAKER_01]: about VPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want them to dry so I can get the seeds
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to smoke the bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing there to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I put pollen in a room, I fucking go
hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pollen eat the shit out of that room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's all seeded.
[SPEAKER_01]: I let it get to a very specific
crispiness, which I measure as dry as
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is my unit of measurement.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want these plants bone dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want them crispy.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm going to do when the plants are
hanging up, they're bone dry, the stems go
[SPEAKER_01]: pop.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I grab the buds, they don't crumble.
[SPEAKER_01]: It rains fucking seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hear seeds hitting the little stir
light, the Tupperware, the Rubbermaid bin
[SPEAKER_01]: underneath it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plink, plink, plink, plink, plink.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I know I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want them bone dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this point I'll take that plant off
the hanger, off the hook, how I had it
[SPEAKER_01]: hanging up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put it inside that stir light bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put on a rubber glove and I will hold
the stick and I'll pull the buds off of
[SPEAKER_01]: the stick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just pull them right off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care if I destroy the buds and
break the sticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of that matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just pulling the sticks out,
pulling the buds off over the bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all falling into the bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm taking the stick, putting the stick in
the trash can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remove as much stick as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get all of the bud material off of the
stick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I put on, sometimes I got to wear two
gloves or different gloves to do this
[SPEAKER_01]: because this shit gets sticky and
sometimes it'll break your gloves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at this point I pick up all the
material and I just rub it through my
[SPEAKER_01]: hands in circles and I break all of the
material basically into like I was going
[SPEAKER_01]: to roll a fat joint and we got to get the
seeds out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've got a machine now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it's all ground up into a joint
rolling size material, which I do not
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke by the way, that gets discarded into
a compost heap.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once I get it all to that fine powdery
sort of texture, then I run it through a
[SPEAKER_01]: little machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Grow Easy or the Easy Seed Seed
Separator.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're unavailable right now and hard to
find, so I'm not even going to advertise
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've got a seed separator that I run
it to.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you Google seed separator, hemp seed
separator, you'll find a lot of great
[SPEAKER_01]: options.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big tall Plinko machine looking
fucking thing, that works great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use that model, use that idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will run all those seeds through
that separating machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they'll come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be a pile of chaff,
which is the sticks, the wasted bud
[SPEAKER_01]: material, the leaf, and then the other
drawer is all seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to run it through a couple times to
refine it and clean it, but I get all my
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then those go into a baggie that is sealed
and labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes if I have enough jars,
they'll go into the jar that gets sealed
[SPEAKER_01]: and labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: You asked about the drying and curing
process of the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, those seeds are ready to
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I let them grow so long, if you're letting
your seeds finish properly, they will fall
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple will fall out of the plant into
the dirt below and start to pop up in your
[SPEAKER_01]: pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good way to say,
I think my fucking seeds are done.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a really good hint of how to
finish to know you're finished.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my drying cure process is on the
stick.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just hang up there and they just dry
until they reach that critical important
[SPEAKER_01]: point of dry as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just grind them up,
separate it, pull the seeds out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest of the stuff, sometimes it goes
to the chicken coop, and not mine,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's a homeo at the chicken coop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or sometimes a compost bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: One time I put it in the Bokashi bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get creative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get rid of that waste to the most creative
and economical way we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't put it in the trash can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to go somewhere that's organic,
and it's not organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's organic material.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's carbon based.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to go re put it back to the
earth, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my whole drying cure process with the
seeds is basically up there on the stick
[SPEAKER_01]: while they're hanging.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let them get dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to smoke them,
and they could be ready as soon as that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant cuts down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's easier to separate them when it's
super dry is why I do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're letting them get finished,
they're almost ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time you cut them down off the
stick, they're falling into the dirt and
[SPEAKER_01]: germinating, they're ready to rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just let them get dry as shit,
sift them out, put them in a jar,
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure they're dry, dry before you put
them in the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's any moisture on there and you
put them in the jar, they will get some
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew growing on the seeds that way,
maybe leave the lid off and stir them
[SPEAKER_01]: around for a few days.
[SPEAKER_01]: But by this point, they should be plenty
dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I've said the catchphrase dry
as fuck, and crumble them out and then get
[SPEAKER_01]: them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe get a machine if not spend all
fucking day sitting there tipping a record
[SPEAKER_01]: back and forth and getting the seeds from
the chaff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to do that, though,
because I'm going to send you a coupon
[SPEAKER_01]: code for free seeds from I read direct.com
