[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 177 of the
grow from your heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this my friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining

[SPEAKER_00]: Stitcher hosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they brag that they have 50,000
podcasts available on their service.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the grow from your heart podcast was
recently ranked number 963 overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to thank everybody for
listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also on Stitcher, we were ranked number 80
in the society and culture category.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were in a top 100 section on
Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes me super proud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for listening, for
supporting the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: iTunes doesn't show me a lot of stats or
anything.

[SPEAKER_00]: Shannon and dad and granny.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also Lindsay and Chris were here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they did put some stuff in their
butt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a couple of messages that said,
Hey bro, as soon as you guys started
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about putting things in your butt,
I checked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my friends said that he was getting
some mental images and some visuals and he
[SPEAKER_00]: did not want to contaminate his brain like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he listened to about three minutes of
the show and checked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize if that was too much for you,
but thanks for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: They listened to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also big thanks to solventless Shannon and
dad and granny for coming and being on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to having both of those
lovely ladies on the podcast again.

[SPEAKER_00]: They will take great care of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am pulling up a message on my phone
here, but I've got an iPhone and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: acting funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how that shit goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you're listening to music.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to unlock me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to do eight other things to get
to the message you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
friend mountain smokes a few episodes
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did an episode called follow your nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about sour diesel and Hispanic
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like I may be a bit racist calling
out the folks of Latin descent for liking
[SPEAKER_00]: sour diesel, but I felt that was something
that I noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend mountain smokes on Snapchat sent
me a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said, oh my gosh, the sour diesel bit
so true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being from Gunnison County, another
heavily populated area, sour diesel has
[SPEAKER_00]: always been growing in the basements and
it was by far the most popular strain I
[SPEAKER_00]: sold there spot on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then she also says also love the podcast
once again and yes, follow your nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for the message and big shout
out to my friend mountain smokes on
[SPEAKER_00]: Snapchat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you follow her on Snapchat.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a cutie.
[SPEAKER_00]: She smokes cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a great cannabis activist and she is
learning a whole bunch and becoming very
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledgeable and she likes to share that
stuff with her viewers on snap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check her out and follow her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to get
right to an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a long email here about powdery
mildew and I feel like I can really give
[SPEAKER_00]: some help.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm pulling up the email while I while
I talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, love the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Longtime listener.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashtag love it when you ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to white Mike, white Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a shout out, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you heard that because we'll get
white Mike back on the podcast real soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a young child.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a life.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can't be on every episode, but we'll
get him back pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on to say, anyways,
I will keep this short.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work at a commercial scale cultivation
site and we have been fighting powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew for a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, and would love some help.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have sprayed fucking everything and I'm
starting to tap out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's indoor and it's in the desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he signs it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then his name, I'm not sure if he
wants everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, he does.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, PS, you can say my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: We out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mathias five eight five on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's M A T H I U S five eight five on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow him if you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about your powdery
mildew situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things we can spray and
things
[SPEAKER_00]: we can do to help treat and correct your
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a lot of water in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to control the
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's hydro, you may need to get some
chillers and cool the water because
[SPEAKER_00]: that'll prevent the water from becoming a
vapor, which becomes humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: which promotes the powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running with rock wool cubes,
you may need to let them dry a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running soil, you may be getting
the soil too wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much water is in the grow facility
itself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have water available to evaporate,
to make condensation in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to help you get powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much moisture, too much water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you're in the desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: So too much moisture, too much water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The outside is hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inside's real moisture, creating a
bubble filled with humidity in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to contribute to your
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need heavy dehumidification in that
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get that old, hot,
stale air out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get some fresh air in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need some ventilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you're treating the air that's
coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something we should talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get that old stale air out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stale air out, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's fresh air coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That fresh air coming in does
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be treated.
You need a filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a filter.
You need a filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same motion you make when you're
watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how you just move your hand
around, blah, blah, blah, back and forth
[SPEAKER_00]: like a windshield wiper?
[SPEAKER_00]: You do that with this light and you walk
over the canopy and just make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: the light shines on every leaf and that
light kills the powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes several applications of that
light to get rid of powdery mildew if you
[SPEAKER_00]: already have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're persistent with it,
that will help.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the room needs to be corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be some water issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need some equipment, some
dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need some air exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature control is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have huge swings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge temperature swings in the night and
in the day are going to cause powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I think about the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: How far apart are your plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they touching if the plant leaves are
laying on top of each other in that little
[SPEAKER_00]: space?
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if we're sitting in a room and I
just put my hand on, this sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: disgusting to me, but what if I just put
my hand on your leg?
[SPEAKER_00]: In my hot hand, I'm 96 degrees or whatever
I am, my hand is just sitting on your leg.
[SPEAKER_00]: In about 20 or 30 minutes, there's going
to be a hot, sweaty spot there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just from our body parts touching and
getting warm, there's going to be a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of sweat in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sweat that those plants create will
cause powdery mildew right there between
[SPEAKER_00]: those two leaves and it'll start spreading
from there rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something you can really help,
defoliate heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm in a large commercial facility,
we spend days just defoliating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it'll be defoliation day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys get super stoned on your break
because when you come back, all you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing is pulling leaves for the next eight
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pluck every leaf with a pedial out of
that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you're the manager,
if you're the boss or if you're the owner,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you are able to, pull every leaf
that you can out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those leaves are where the powdery mildew
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what you can do for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spread them out, kind of take off all the
big leaves, put some air on them,
[SPEAKER_00]: fan them around.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the powdery mildew can't develop
because it's blown around too much,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can't develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the humidity doesn't stay stagnant,
the powdery mildew will have a harder time
[SPEAKER_00]: developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about, you said you've
sprayed everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet your plants look pissed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got powdery mildew and you're
spraying them with stuff and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to fight the powdery mildew and
then they're getting shit sprayed on them
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet they're getting mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you're getting frustrated as hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay positive, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to beat this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious what you've sprayed because
sometimes your sprays are going to add
[SPEAKER_00]: more moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to add more humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've sprayed commercial rooms thinking,
yay, I just got rid of powdery mildew and
[SPEAKER_00]: I came back the next day and the powdery
mildew was actually fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was thicker, drove me fucking nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I'm saying, you got to fix the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to spread the plants apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a bunch of water on the
floor, squeegee and chop back that shit
[SPEAKER_00]: up, get rid of that extra water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: What have you sprayed?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a product called Big Time
Exterminator that I have heard works
[SPEAKER_00]: wonders on powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's organic and it is, okay, here's
something I should mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado, we are very limited on
products that we can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people will say, go get a bottle
of Eagle 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: And spray that shit right on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eagle 20 will get rid of your powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may take one application.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may take two applications, but your
powdery mildew will be gone for 30 days,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe 45 to 60 days guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally do not like Eagle 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of deadly, dangerous,
shitty chemicals in there that we do not
[SPEAKER_00]: need to spray on our plants that we are
going to call medicine to give to sick
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not recommend Eagle 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado, Eagle 20 is completely
banned.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not allowed to use it in a
recreational or a medical facility that is
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated by the Colorado Marijuana
Enforcement Division.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a banned product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that some products are banned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps us safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps our growers safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps the consumers safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't done enough research on a lot
of these chemicals to know what's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen to us if we smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of these things affect your body
in a way that, say I spray my plants with
[SPEAKER_00]: Eagle 20 today and we let them flower,
we harvest them, we cut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably, you know, 50 to 60 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You let them dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably still Eagle 20 on those
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I smoke it, I don't think I'm going
to notice anything right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may get a funky taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: My throat may burn, but that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm thinking that in like 10 years is
when I'm going to notice the fuck up from
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get a twitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: My left eye is going to pop out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might get a limp or even a bigger fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it does something to my DNA or my
RNA and my, I don't plan on having any
[SPEAKER_00]: more kids, but maybe you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it'll fuck up your RNA and your DNA
and your kids will come out with three
[SPEAKER_00]: arms or three eyes or one foot or 14 toes,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't know enough about what these,
these chemicals kill mildews and they kill
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's doing something biologically or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on what kind of chemical you're
using, but it's doing something and it
[SPEAKER_00]: could be getting into your body and
fucking up your body by smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to be really careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I got way off topic, just kind of
on a rant there, but if you want to spray
[SPEAKER_00]: Eagle 20, go on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit that shit with Eagle 20, problem
solved.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a little bit of time to figure out
how to fix the rooms and then hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: you can fix it again and not ever have to
use the Eagle 20 again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend that shit you guys at
all, at all, at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that we are allowed to use in
Colorado, a product called Big Time
[SPEAKER_00]: Exterminator.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mostly citrus oil or citrus,
it's citrus something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's citrus oil, mostly citrus oil
extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a nice like lemony smell,
orangey smell, citrusy smell to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mixed that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I put, I did whatever the bucket
says.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's ingredients on the bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go the heavy route, mix it up with some
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray that right on the plants and that
stuff should calm down the powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to go for a few applications
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll take care of your powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another product that I have seen work on
powdery mildew is 30% hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a guy put 50 milliliters of hydrogen
peroxide in a five gallon bucket and
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayed that directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: He adjusted the pH and then sprayed that
directly onto the entire crop and you
[SPEAKER_00]: could kind of see the hydrogen peroxide
break down the powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sprayed the entire crop and then he
went ahead and sprayed the entire room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sprayed everything down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything smelled like hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smelled super clean in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took several applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he was going at it daily but by
the end of a week the powdery mildew was
[SPEAKER_00]: gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can use PM wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use, oh sorry I didn't say PM
wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a product called PM wash which I
haven't used it but I've read great things
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The PM wash should wash the powdery mildew
off of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So peroxide, PM wash and big time
exterminator are three products that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can order them over the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can probably buy them at your local
grow stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those products I'm told will get rid of
your powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen the hydrogen peroxide do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen the big time exterminator do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll take multiple applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be persistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to pay attention to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna need a little bit of love
after this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're gonna spray them for several
days with a product like big time
[SPEAKER_00]: exterminator or hydrogen peroxide I
recommend give them a day of rest and then
[SPEAKER_00]: spray them with push from our friends at
Veg Bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not pay me to talk about their
products but push is an amazing product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a foliar product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little hard to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit expensive but oh my god
it's worth every penny and if you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: do this much damage and this much beating
up to your plants I think push would be
[SPEAKER_00]: really helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another product I can recommend is a
product called stylet oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stylet oil is not allowed to be used in a
recreational or commercial facility in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado but I have used it myself and it
did take care of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stylet oil is an oil that coats your plant
and it will not allow the powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will not allow fungus nets to gather on
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't let mites get on the bottom side
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing wants anything to do with stylet
oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with stylet oil is it strips
the cuticles off your plant leaves and it
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves them really vulnerable and they
look a little leathery.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get kind of sad at you about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to use stylet oil I would,
if your plants are small enough,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would dunk the plants into a stylet oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dilute it heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go straight into the oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry let me say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix up some stylet oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot think of the dilution
recommendations but it is on the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dunk the plant into the stylet oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get every leaf in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a good wiggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set it back in the grow area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn off the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it about an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let all the plants dry after you've dunked
everything and then go back with the
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayer and hose off every single plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stylet oil will dry and coat and then
you just want to kind of rinse off the
[SPEAKER_00]: excess and all of your powdery mildew and
bugs should be removed within the first
[SPEAKER_00]: application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stylet oil will fuck your plants up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're not strong it's going to beat
the shit out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe test a couple of plants because it
does beat your plants up heavily but it
[SPEAKER_00]: will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had almost forgotten about the stylet
oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you located man?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a huge bottle of JMS stylet oil
that I do not think I'm going to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're near me we can work out a deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just fucking I want to see what happens
when you use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where am I now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that we can talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend Frosty Organics was on the
podcast quite a while back and he talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about lactic acid bacteria spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frosty taught us that he can make his own
lactic acid bacteria spray and apply it to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants and he says that one
application will remove his powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how well that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not tried it myself but I do trust
the shit out of Frosty Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to learn about lactic acid
bacteria and how to treat your cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants with it you can google lactic acid
bacteria and then powdery mildew and then
[SPEAKER_00]: there will be the word Clackamas in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clackamas is a city in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a guy named Clackamas Coot who is
from that part of Oregon who wrote an
[SPEAKER_00]: article about making lactic acid bacteria
to treat for powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you google it it should not be too hard
to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys something else I want to mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: In professional horticultural applications
and environments what is commonly used for
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew is a product called
potassium bicarbonate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's available in several different forms
from what I read.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say that it mixes up very much like a
baking soda in water and you apply that to
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants as a foliar spray and that
disrupts the pH on the surface of the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: which will get rid of your powdery mildew
and it is a horticultural standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what they use in large greenhouses
for large production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So potassium bicarbonate from what I read
it's like it comes in a very powdery form
[SPEAKER_00]: that's like baking soda.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say it's available in other forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's something that'll help you
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a commercial grow I'm not
sure if that will be legal so make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you check out all of the laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the rules so everything I say
needs to be researched before you apply
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that people are going to
recommend for you for your powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: issue people are going to say to hang a
sulfur burner in the grow and run the
[SPEAKER_00]: sulfur burner for an hour or 45 minutes
every few hours or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's going to have their own recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly advise against this you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not like a sulfur burner.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a dispensary in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not call them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were a very very well known
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a very well known breeder working
with them who actually left and started
[SPEAKER_00]: his own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That facility was having a powdery mildew
issue and their solution was to run a
[SPEAKER_00]: sulfur burner.
[SPEAKER_00]: The results were for about six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you would shop at that
dispensary everything would have at first
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a flavor of sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would smoke it and you'd be like why
does this taste weird and it was sulfury.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once somebody would say I think there's a
sulfur burner your brain would go oh yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: that totally tastes like sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really strong at first and over
a few months it faded out but you could
[SPEAKER_00]: taste it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've gotten rid of the sulfur burner.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've corrected their problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it doesn't happen but that's why you
don't run a sulfur burner in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will make your plants taste like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't do the sulfur burner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not something I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that you can do that may help
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you're using mother plants
or if you're taking plants taking cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: from your vegging plants or how that works
but when you were taking clones I
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend dunking them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut my clone from the mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put them in a cup with water and a small
bit of nutrients and then I carry that cup
[SPEAKER_00]: filled with cuttings to another area where
they are trimmed up and then they are
[SPEAKER_00]: dunked into a solution and then they are
dipped and then stuck into either the
[SPEAKER_00]: cloner if I'm working at one facility or
they're put into plugs if I'm at another
[SPEAKER_00]: facility or they're put in a rock wall at
another facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on where I'm working and
who I'm working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I got going on but after the cut I
like to dunk the freshly cut clone and
[SPEAKER_00]: trimmed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cut off the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You trim off all the extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I dunk that right into something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will change my product up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I use Banish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I will use the what's it called
the big time exterminator.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys I wrote down BTE and I can always
forget that that stands for big time
[SPEAKER_00]: exterminator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll mix up the hydrogen
peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just depends on what's available and what
I'm treating for what I think I may be at
[SPEAKER_00]: risk for but we know that powdery mildew
is the problem here so mix up a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of hydrogen peroxide in your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just use a five gallon bucket and
anywhere between 30 and 70 mils of
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen peroxide usually seems to work
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut the clone dunk that right into the
five gallon bucket of hydrogen peroxide
[SPEAKER_00]: give it a nice hefty shake and then put
that into the dip and grow or the clone X
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever you were using wherever the
hell we are and then stick that right into
[SPEAKER_00]: the the cloner whatever I'm going into and
then I know that I killed all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew so that I've got a fresh
start so that that clone can root and have
[SPEAKER_00]: a healthy start then as soon as it roots
and it gets put into its first pot I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: spray it with something and then every
I'll spray it once a week with something
[SPEAKER_00]: and then if I see powdery mildew or here's
a here's a hint a little bit before
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew starts you will see the
little tiny bumps pop up the leaf may
[SPEAKER_00]: start to just get a little bit bumpy I
don't even know how to it just looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: a little pimple or a war or something
funky coming up on the leaf but it's real
[SPEAKER_00]: small so if you start seeing that then
it's time to start treating for powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew extra strong get out your UV clean
light get out your hydrogen peroxide get
[SPEAKER_00]: out the PM wash the big-time exterminator
the lactic acid bacteria the potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: bicarbonate something like that get it out
there start treating those plants because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna see the powdery mildew but if
I see that that's when I start stepping up
[SPEAKER_00]: my game going a little bit harder one more
thing I should mention is the powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew could be on your clothes you're
carrying it around from the flower room to
[SPEAKER_00]: the veg room to the mother room to the
clone room it's in your air conditioning
[SPEAKER_00]: ducts it's in your HVAC system it is
everywhere it needs to be taken care of it
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to be treated if you've got those
silly ducks that have the insulation
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of them tear that shit out of there
I know that could be a multi thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: dollar job for your facility but all of
that insulation inside of there is
[SPEAKER_00]: harboring harboring that was a hard word
to say the insulation is harboring powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew and it will eventually be a place
for bugs to hide out once one gets in
[SPEAKER_00]: there just takes two and those bugs will
start a party it'll be disgusting so you
[SPEAKER_00]: could have the powdery mildew on your
clothes make sure everybody's changing
[SPEAKER_00]: clothes properly I bet you've got a grower
that has a private grow at home and he's
[SPEAKER_00]: got powdery mildew also and as soon as he
starts getting rid of powdery mildew you
[SPEAKER_00]: get it worse and then as soon as your
facility starts getting it cleaned up he
[SPEAKER_00]: gets it worse and you guys are just
passing that shit back and forth and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: never gonna go away so start changing your
clothes get some dedicated clothes
[SPEAKER_00]: dedicated shoes a dedicated hat if you've
got long hair or dreadlocks get it wrapped
[SPEAKER_00]: up get it in a hat get it covered up you
guys I'm always going and retucking my
[SPEAKER_00]: dreads because I try to keep everything
covered up I don't want dragging my dreads
[SPEAKER_00]: along around the grow I think it's gross
and I need to be picking up bugs or
[SPEAKER_00]: leaving hair in the flowers just just keep
your dreads in your hair covered up if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a big man wook beard or if
you've got a hipster beard cover that shit
[SPEAKER_00]: up too just try to be clean you guys
another thing I really want to recommend I
[SPEAKER_00]: did work in a facility that was riddled
with powdery mildew I won't call them out
[SPEAKER_00]: on a podcast most of my friends and
listeners know who the fuck I'm talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about the place was riddled with powdery
mildew they fired a girl I took over I
[SPEAKER_00]: walked in and I said well you've got bugs
and powdery mildew to start with and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like yes we do help us I tried to
get rid of it you guys but being MED
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated I understand the struggle that
my listener here has it was a pain in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ass everybody in that grow got sick
because of the powdery mildew the mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: is gone you guys it took two or three
crops two or three crop cycles to get rid
[SPEAKER_00]: of it but the powdery mildew was actually
gone we got rid of it in a hundred light
[SPEAKER_00]: facility the PM was gone you could not see
it you could not smell it you could not
[SPEAKER_00]: taste it it was cleaned up so they did
their job they got rid of it but everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of got like a sinus sort of thing
everybody showed different symptoms but
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody could agree that it was messing
up their noses their throat and their eye
[SPEAKER_00]: region so wear a mask if you've got a
ventilator a respirator or even one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those just shitty little paper Asian bird
flu masks just wear one of those when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're working with the powdery mildew
because you don't want to get sick from it
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to deny that I was sick from the
powdery mildew but once it was gone I felt
[SPEAKER_00]: better and I could tell that my allergy
problem and my throat thing was happening
[SPEAKER_00]: because of that powdery mildew that's what
was doing it so please take care of
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself if the plants are bad powdery
mildewy you have to think about if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to release that product to the public
because you don't want to be responsible
[SPEAKER_00]: for making people sick so that's a moral
thing you're gonna have to think about
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself something that they do allow here
in Colorado they will let you blast the
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew buds the marijuana
enforcement division has decided that it
[SPEAKER_00]: is safe to put powdery mildew buds and
trim into a tube and run butane over and
[SPEAKER_00]: turn it in to bho hash dabs shatter wax it
turns into distillate eventually it gets
[SPEAKER_00]: put into edibles eventually so yeah
they're deeming it safe so if that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to do with it do that that's the
best I can recommend with it but honestly
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's coated in powdery mildew think
about this my friend Doug is getting old
[SPEAKER_00]: and Doug's got a lung problem and when
Doug smokes regular cannabis he coughs
[SPEAKER_00]: when Doug smokes cannabis that's got
something on it he coughs a lot and gets
[SPEAKER_00]: really sick Doug is smoking because he's
sick and trying to prolong and save his
[SPEAKER_00]: life we do not want to give Doug powdery
mildews and mycotoxins and funky shit for
[SPEAKER_00]: his lungs to kill him more quickly I love
Doug I fucking want him here treat
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody like Doug okay everybody that's
getting cannabis is my friend Doug and my
[SPEAKER_00]: mind we all have to take care of all of
our patients like they are Doug all right
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug is a real dude but I kind of
exaggerated his story Doug's not that sick
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys just wanted to use him as an
example because he's a good dude all right
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I've given you some information
that kind of teaches you how to at least
[SPEAKER_00]: control and harness and get rid of this
powdery mildew I'm not sure what you can
[SPEAKER_00]: do where you are so you can spray any of
these products that you choose to spray
[SPEAKER_00]: you can defoliate things that I fully
recommend you do are get the old air out
[SPEAKER_00]: the fresh air in dehumidify do some
filtration also space out the plants a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit make sure they aren't touching
each other and then control temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: swings you're in the desert and you're
putting a bunch of water inside of a
[SPEAKER_00]: building you're making it excuse me you're
making a big Tupperware dish and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: you're making a giant comb dome is what
you're doing in there so you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: evacuate the humidity and get that out of
the room don't be afraid to throw away
[SPEAKER_00]: some plants if they're starting to get too
bad I know that sounds terrible in a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial production facility I've been
there before trust me I have dealt with
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're dealing with some days it
makes you want to punch yourself straight
[SPEAKER_00]: in the face but I did an episode a few
episodes back called stay positive and if
[SPEAKER_00]: you didn't have powdery mildew you
wouldn't be getting so many hours should
[SPEAKER_00]: be too easy wouldn't be a challenge
wouldn't be fun anymore so you got to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through some struggles and that way when
those issues are gone it's gonna be like
[SPEAKER_00]: you're fucking cruising in the coolest
damn facility ever and you'll appreciate
[SPEAKER_00]: it that's what I think stay positive don't
pull your hair out don't put yourself in
[SPEAKER_00]: the face keep growing and dude if you have
any more questions please send me an email
[SPEAKER_00]: if anybody out there has any questions

[SPEAKER_00]: manager or pest management and
identification of problems in the garden I
[SPEAKER_00]: am working on that that's going to be a
long episode I may do it in multiple parts
