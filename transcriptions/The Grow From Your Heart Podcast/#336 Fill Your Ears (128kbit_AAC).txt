[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for another episode of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast, your source for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis news, education and conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who is
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the podcast is brought to
you by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new genetics for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find them at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, roll up a fat joint,
pack up the bong or start heating up that
[SPEAKER_00]: dab rig because it's time for another
episode of the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, internet world?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 336 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start these episodes
off by letting you know what I'm smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking dabs of the chem brulee full
spectrum extract from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the chem brulee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I bought all of the chem brulee
they had in my local dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to find a new place to
get that or wait for a fresh drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went today and they did not have any
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had plenty of other things to offer,
but the chem brulee has been my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes like lemon peels, lime peels,
and gasoline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's this after flavor that I
can barely figure out what it tastes like,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high is perfect for what I'm looking
for today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the chem brulee full spectrum extract
from Green Dot Labs, that's what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the best part is I'm smoking out of a
brand new rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody was sweet enough to gift me a
brand new rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a sweet rasta colored Star of
David with a Star of David shaped opal on
[SPEAKER_00]: the back of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rig, of course, has red, yellow and
green line work in it because of course I
[SPEAKER_00]: love the red, yellow and green work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a little banger hanger style rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's adorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was made by TW Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the person who gifted me
this rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would rather remain anonymous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is so me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is perfectly what I would want for a
rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the right size.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is rasta colored and it hits like a
fucking truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly appreciate this gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much love and appreciation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, big shout out to my friends at
Elevate Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I went to Elevate and I picked up a
new banger for this rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a brand new thermal banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying to q-tip it and keep it
clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also picked up a sexy new red,
yellow and green carb cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some white in there also,
but it matches the rig pretty nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it looks really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also got some butane.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a new dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got nice and laced up at Elevate Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not pay me to talk about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just took really good care of me
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Mike over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Becca.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all the Elevate dolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love, much respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, big shout out to Mike, White Mike,
for riding up with me today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got Mike out of town, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kidnapped Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took Mike up to Springs and we spent
most of the day shopping around in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Mike, thanks for hanging out,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a good time with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get you out of the house more
often.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, what's next?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yesterday I had the honor of recording a
live podcast with the folks from Growing
[SPEAKER_00]: with Fishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, I was on the Growing with
Fishes podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a live podcast on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: The episode is still available on YouTube
if you want to go back and watch my guest
[SPEAKER_00]: appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend you just go follow the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys have a great setup going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are four or five, maybe five or six
dudes that all join together through
[SPEAKER_00]: Google Hangouts and they go and just talk
about cannabis and cannabis growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had a bunch of great guests on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had Ed Rosenthal on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had Tad Hussey on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a great show and the guys are
just great dudes to hang out and talk with
[SPEAKER_00]: and listen to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you enjoy this show, I recommend the
Growing with Fishes podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if nothing else, check out my live
appearance on there on their YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I just did a quick little search
for you just so that you don't have to do
[SPEAKER_00]: any searching.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to YouTube and then search for
Growing with Fishes podcast, episode 97,
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff, that'll be the quickest way to
find the episode I'm on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just want to watch random episodes,
as soon as you search Growing with Fishes,
[SPEAKER_00]: the first episode that pops up is Tad
Hussey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just go ahead and listen to that
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tad has another great podcast about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: He speaks very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows what he's talking about when it
comes to cannabis and it is a great
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be a very good introduction
if you don't want to start with the Rasta
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out once again to my friends at
the Growing with Fishes podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I made six new friends while being
on that show yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, the next thing on my agenda to
talk about is an apology once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to think I put out a pretty high
quality podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I put a lot of work into it
personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I write a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a lot of thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a lot of preparation.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the mic comes on, I try to be in a
good mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to have a nice flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to put out information that can be
absorbed by people that learn from
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple different learning styles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody learns the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to teach you two or three
different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you hear me kind of repeat
myself a little bit, but I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: paint the picture so that everybody can
visualize what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to be really thorough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the episode I wrote about
building a water system, an automated or
[SPEAKER_00]: assisted watering system, that was a
really good episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were like seven pages of printed
notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it came time to record it,
I thought I did a really good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it came time to edit it,
my computer started eating the audio file.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have diagnosed the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have unplugged the piece of equipment
that I think was giving me shit and I have
[SPEAKER_00]: replaced it with another piece of
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so far I'm about six minutes into this
recording and I haven't heard a glitch,
[SPEAKER_00]: a pop, a buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've identified the piece of
equipment that has gone rogue on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I think has gone to shit is my Tascam
US-1200 USB interface, the part that turns
[SPEAKER_00]: my audio signal into a digital signal that
lets me shoot it into the computer,
[SPEAKER_00]: that lets me shoot it to the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that part has taken a crap on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have unplugged that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've plugged in the Zoom H6 and I'm using
the H6 as the interface right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds good to my ears and the
recording seems to be working smoothly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The software has accepted everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I didn't start seeing problems
in the recording last time until about 20
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna record an episode here with
the Zoom H6.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not going to be a grow intensive
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read some iTunes comments and
read a couple of emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way if something happens with this
file, I don't feel like a highly detailed
[SPEAKER_00]: grow lesson got ruined and wasted and I
don't have to redo that for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this all started off with me saying,
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry for that piece of shit episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I put out last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked really hard on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can tell by what was
presented, but the audio file disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more I tried to search and figure
out what was going on, the more stuff just
[SPEAKER_00]: kept disappearing from garage band.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't want to lose more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put out what I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for the incomplete assignment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you guys expect more than that from
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that I'm better than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to say, I was embarrassed to
put that out, but I was also frustrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 1.30 in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was exhausted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was frustrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to put something out and
give up and move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we are with the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds good so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've given you a solid apology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it doesn't happen again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't promise because I am not a USB
device.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't promise you that I may not just go
rogue at some point and start recording in
[SPEAKER_00]: a different bit rate or just start
deleting chunks of the file.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't promise you, but I can promise you
that I will do my best to keep bringing
[SPEAKER_00]: you the best quality podcast I can
present.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, thanks for bearing with me for a
crappy podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of made me feel bad to tell you
the honest truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made me feel guilty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys count on me for some shit and I
delivered crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like a bad waiter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a bad host, but I'm
recovering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move forward from that crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are all giving me hugs and
forgiving me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for supporting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I don't want to put out a
crazy grow episode in case this recording
[SPEAKER_00]: goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that my Tascam device was the
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything feels really smooth right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Zoom H6 is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to record a couple of episodes
before I go super intense on gross stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure nothing's going to screw up on
me again.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I noticed my problem started
happening during playback.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm going to do before I read some
iTunes comments, I'm going to press pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to play back this part of the
show that I've already recorded.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to see how it sounds,
make sure everything looks good,
[SPEAKER_00]: sounds good and feels good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if it works well, I'll keep
recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I'm listening back, I'm going to
take a bunch of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get lit as shit on this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually don't take a lot of dabs during
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see how this goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make sure the equipment
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make sure the new rig
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make sure the new hash
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make sure we're just going
to have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to go all crazy on this
episode, you guys, but please hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll listen to some iTunes comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may read a couple of emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang out with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to listen back a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might drop a song in right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know what could happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do promise that if you bear with me
through a couple of funky episodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're going to get real crazy on Grow
Lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got so much Grow stuff written down
that I can't wait to get to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I really want to make sure my
equipment works before I start doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe one or two episodes of just some
random stuff, and then we're going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: hard on Grow Lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you guys love the lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of you guys love hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please bear with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, while I'm thinking about it,
big shout out to everybody who supports me
[SPEAKER_00]: on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the Patreon support,
having a broken piece of equipment is not
[SPEAKER_00]: a financial struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can replace this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to decide which one I want,
and then I can order it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I want the Tascam two and two out,
or do I want to get the one that fits in
[SPEAKER_00]: the rack?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like another rack mounted device.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of debating if that's necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly just use two channels for the
USB.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run a Mackie mixer into a compressor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The compressor has a left and right out,
and I run that left and right out into
[SPEAKER_00]: channels one and two on my Tascam USB
device.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I probably just need the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not rack mounted, and that's
frustrating to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that it all fits in this nice rack
I've got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I did say nice rack.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm fucking rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to press pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a bunch of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you take some dabs with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to listen back to everything
I've recorded, make sure it sounds good,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I'll be right back to keep going
with the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World, I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you love that funky cowbell groove.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I took a bunch of great dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dabbed some of this chem brulee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also dabbed some of this sole cleanser.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sole cleanser tastes like Gatorade
powder and Windex, kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's delicious and weird all at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Took a bunch of dabs, made sure this new
rig works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be passing quality control
standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, the part I've recorded sounds
pretty good, other than my voice being in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The recording works pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for hanging out with me,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm having fun today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm having fun recording with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you are enjoying this weird
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be a normal episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels different to me because I'm
recording with different equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm waiting for something to go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, nothing does go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it kind of feels like school on a
rainy day or like I've got a substitute
[SPEAKER_00]: teacher.
[SPEAKER_00]: My eyes are bouncing back and forth from
the computer screen to the Zoom H6,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the mixer, to the compressor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just making sure all the correct
lights are flashing at the right time,
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of making sure the gear works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will get this dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're only going to have to do this one
more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the new replacement piece comes in,
I'll have to dial that in and then we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: have the podcast right back up to speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get into those killer grow episodes
like I've been talking about because I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not bullshitting you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an episode about germinating
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an episode about cutting clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an episode about putting those
seeds or clones into soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an episode about transplanting
those once they get larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an episode about vegetative
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that's enough to let you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a whole bunch of great shit lined
up for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I have an episode planned to talk
about seed versus clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not sure if you want to grow
from seeds or clone when you start your
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh garden, I've got an episode all
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about the pros and cons of
each.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's coming up in the future,
but let's get the equipment dialed in
[SPEAKER_00]: before we start putting out super
intensive grow lessons and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: computer fails and it makes me want to
just go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get that dialed in and we'll work on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the meantime, let's get to some iTunes
customer ratings and reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to leave a rating and review
on iTunes, I would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're listening through iTunes on your
computer or if you're listening on an
[SPEAKER_00]: Apple device, open up the podcast app,
find my show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably subscribed to it already.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, search for the grow from your
heart podcast, click subscribe,
[SPEAKER_00]: then scroll down where it says available
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep scrolling past that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll show you the ratings and reviews
that are already there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then at the bottom, it will give you the
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will say, write a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just click right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you click on there, it gives you the
opportunity to give one through five
[SPEAKER_00]: stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I would appreciate five stars,
but give me what you feel I deserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be honest, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would appreciate it if you type in
a comment and let me know what you think
[SPEAKER_00]: about the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only way ratings and reviews
work is if you're honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go ahead and type in the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us know what you think of the show and
I will read your review on a future
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get into some of the reviews we
have received through the month of May up
[SPEAKER_00]: till now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, this review was left on April 26th.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember if we've read this one or
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from April 26th of 2018.

by a person who calls themselves madcapv2.
[SPEAKER_00]: madcapv2's review has a headline that says
great vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, he left us five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the review goes like this.

[SPEAKER_00]: I love the show.

[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it up.

the iPad will cooperate here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one also was left on May 7th of 2018
by a person who calls themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: redhousegrows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their headline of the review is awesome
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, they left five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: The review goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm currently at episode 250 and catching
all the way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: redhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I keep your sanity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I help you keep your sanity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You listen to me for four hours to 12
hours a day and it helps keep your sanity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure that what you've got
qualifies as sanity if my voice for four
[SPEAKER_00]: to 12 hours a day keeps you sane.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, dude, honestly, I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of listening to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you've caught up with all of the
episodes by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're listening to four to 12 hours of
us a day, you're probably getting pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: close to caught up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious if you just listened to the
100 episodes that are available in the
[SPEAKER_00]: feed or if you've gone all the way back to
YouTube and started at episode one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Episode one is available on a playlist
that is on the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: One through 20 are on a playlist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then 21 through current are on my YouTube
channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go listen to everything,
it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may seem weird because back in the day,
the show was called the I Grow Culture
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came to find out that I Grow Culture is
already taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the name of an educational
institution they teach about agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: on the college level over the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go figure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was original.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't trying to steal a name,
but as soon as they told me that name was
[SPEAKER_00]: taken, I changed my name to the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much more appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I hope you're listening to the old
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, seriously, thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for catching up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we really are making your day
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also thanks for supporting my friends,
The Dude Grow Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys aren't listening to The Dude
Grows, you should check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another great cannabis podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we should be listening and
supporting all of the cannabis podcasts
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're all out to do the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no competition in my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all the same goal, so let's all
support each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I am rambly today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're having as much fun as I am
with this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Red House Grows, thanks for a great
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gonna move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: This review comes from our friend
Nannerboy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Nannerboy?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't see the headline because the
review is short.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no button to press more,
but I can see that there is a headline and
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it says thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see Than.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna hope that's the start of thank
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I typed in Than, my autocorrect would
say thank you or happy Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this came in May, so I'm going to
assume it says thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, it's from May 31st from Nannerboy
and it says, met you at the DGC Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for hanging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just mentioned my friends at the DGC
Cup, the Dude Grows crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aw, man, I had a good time hanging out
with Nannerboy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys had a safe trip and I look
forward to seeing you at the next Dude
[SPEAKER_00]: Grows Cup if that's the thing that happens
this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to both my friends,
all three of my friends, the Dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: Scotty, and Guru.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope everybody's well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dude has moved to Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scotty's having some health issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Guru is holding it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to all three of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope they're all doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope Dude's move is going well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope the transition is happening well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope Scotty's coming along with the
health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Guru, man, keep killing it,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super smart, always on top of your shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it when you step in and shine some
light on subjects that the boys are just
[SPEAKER_00]: way in the dark in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should keep going with these reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Told you guys, I got high and rambly,
so have fun with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, nothing has gone wrong with the
recording equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep looking at everything and I'm
happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're almost 20 minutes in and nothing has
caught on fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: No springs have flown out like it does on
the cartoons.
[SPEAKER_00]: How come when something breaks on the
cartoons, springs fly out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes boing and springs and sprockets
fly out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be somebody's heart and springs
fly out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's so fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was left on June 17th from
somebody who calls themselves Mateo 505.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to guess it's one of our
Albuquerque friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our New Mexico friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: This review says Rasta Jeff is the jefe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means I'm the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave us five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: The review goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff is the man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to the knowledge he freely
shares every week and goes into detail
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of skimming over subjects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He looks forward to the knowledge I freely
share.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do ask for Patreon contributions,
but that is if you're able to.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're able to throw down on Patreon,
please do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's patreon.com slash grow from your
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not required to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the folks who do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people who have been contributing to
Patreon upgraded the MacBook Pro I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: using.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people who contributed to Patreon are
going to be the people I have to say thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you to when I replace my Tascam device.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon has been very kind to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not required to pay for this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to put this out because I love
recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's kind of my duty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it sounds weird, but we're all put
here for something and I've got a few
[SPEAKER_00]: solid purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I know I'm meant to be doing and this
is something that I know like if if they
[SPEAKER_00]: came to something if whoever you believe
in, you know, you guys know what I believe
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If John came to me and said you can only
pick five things recording would be
[SPEAKER_00]: recording this podcast would be one of the
five things I know I'm supposed to be
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I wouldn't cut this out because
I know it's right anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking rambling you guys sharing the
knowledge freely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because I feel like it's my gift
that I need to give back to you guys to
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis plant and the cannabis
community has been super kind to me and
[SPEAKER_00]: super generous to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just turn that back around and just
put that right back out is what I feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, he says I go into detail instead of
skimming over subjects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do kind of pick one subject and beat the
shit out of it for an entire episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said earlier, people don't all
learn from the same thing the same type of
[SPEAKER_00]: teaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why in school the teacher used to
bore the shit out of me because she would
[SPEAKER_00]: teach five different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I caught on the first way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there were kids that that first
the way she taught that didn't click.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had to teach it the second way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were probably some kids weren't
Velcro shoes that needed the third
[SPEAKER_00]: teaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to make sure that everybody
can figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all don't have some of us think in
cartoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of us think with fucking graph paper
in our brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of us can think in AutoCAD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to make sure that the people
thinking in crayons, the people thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: in AutoCAD, the people that have done this
a thousand times want to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody feels included in the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to lose it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to lose anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is your first grow, I want this to
make sense to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been growing commercially for a
hundred years and you've done it all,
[SPEAKER_00]: I still want this show to be entertaining
to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I hit things at different
angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the other shows just skim
right over stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be like, what's the best kind of
light?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like HBSs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, ah, there were so many
things you fucking skipped right over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm good at finding those things and
documenting them and making sure you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: don't miss detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for noticing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he goes on to say, keep up the good
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey man, keep listening and keep growing
quality cannabis for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will keep putting out the best
podcast I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, Mateo 505, thank you for the great
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the five stars and thanks
for noticing the hard work, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep repping the 505 down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're hanging out with our friends
from Organtica.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I've got one more iTunes
customer review.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was left on July 3rd.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was from my friend, Juanzilla.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Juanzilla?
[SPEAKER_00]: Juan comes and hangs out in my Instagram
live feeds quite often.
[SPEAKER_00]: We interact quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Juan's a cool person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Juan's personality.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a great dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He left a five star rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the headline is such a great
tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, if you are even curious about the
work that goes into growing, listen to
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff explain everything ranging from light
cycles to phenos and everything else in
[SPEAKER_00]: between.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, who is a regular guest is always a
great addition to any episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that's a really cool review of my
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's inviting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes people want to listen to the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're even curious about the work that
goes into growing, listen to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that you trust me that I can
tell you what's going on, that you know
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it enough and I figured out how
to word it properly, that you trust me to
[SPEAKER_00]: explain it to the new folks, which is my
goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Explain everything from light cycles to
phenos to everything else in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is pretty cool because light cycles
is like the first shit you need to figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then phenos is like some advanced
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've highlighted that we're doing it
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everything in between that covers
it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you shout out white Mike,
who white Mike and I had a lot of fun
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's cool that you acknowledge that
Mike is a regular guest and always a great
[SPEAKER_00]: addition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike likes to get us rambly and talkative
and he opens up a whole new point of view
[SPEAKER_00]: and a whole new perspective on the way
that things are done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate having Mike on here and it
sounds like you guys do too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hey, Juan, thank you for the great
review, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the loyalty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the five stars and thanks for
hanging out, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I mentioned the Instagram live
feed where Juan hangs out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to follow my Instagram live,
I answer live questions right there on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram live feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can type in a question, I'll read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if I know the answer off the top
of my head, I will give you my best
[SPEAKER_00]: answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, honestly, I don't know things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are things that I haven't studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are things that I haven't
researched.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll say, I don't remember
asking me that in a couple of days and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to read about it and then I'll
hit you back with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you follow me on Instagram,
it's Iri underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I-R-I-E underscore genetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn on your notifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I go live, your phone will ding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to open it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get to watch me go live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really interactive with the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I answer grow questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we just get real goofy and hang
out and have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think you would enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like the podcast, you would like
the live feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little less formal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of bullshit a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get super stoned on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no editing so you can see what's
really going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, onezilla, shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, big shout out to everybody who left.
[SPEAKER_00]: A rating and review today and in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That helps us out on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you haven't left a rating or a
review yet, I would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you head right over to iTunes,
type in a little review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you think about the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, the show is creeping
up on 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at 26 minutes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have not had any technical
difficulties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed that the previous issues
would happen when I would stop the
[SPEAKER_00]: recording and go back and record over a
messed up track.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done that a couple of times on
purpose now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to kind of mess with the recording
software and see if that was where the
[SPEAKER_00]: issue lies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The issue does not seem to be within the
computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The issue I'm 90% certain was with this
Tascam device.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to replace that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everything should be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure why I feel like I have to
tell you about all of my tech issues,
[SPEAKER_00]: but now we're on the same page together
and we're all friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, before I start wrapping
up this podcast, let's talk a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about my most recent breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I come on here and I share
what I'm working on in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, I decided to make more lemon
Jeffrey feminized seeds and more golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden goat is just a golden goat female
reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I turn it into a boy and I use that pollen
on another golden goat clone and that
[SPEAKER_00]: makes golden goat S1 self seeds that will
make progeny, that'll make offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look just like golden goat for the
most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will have golden goat S1 feminized
seeds that are reliable golden goat
[SPEAKER_00]: looking seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I took that golden goat feminized
pollen and I threw some of that on my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite lemon skunk plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes lemon Jeffrey feminized R1
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will be giant colas that smell like
lemon candy that are just coated in
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds are usually bright green and
super sticky and it makes amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the lemon Jeffrey and the golden goat
feminized seeds are almost done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I kind of quit talking about it for
a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed like I was just hyping up a
product that wasn't going to be available
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of people were asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, they should be harvested very
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds are hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pulled a couple seeds out, gave them a
squeeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are hard enough to my
satisfaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will cut them down very soon and we will
have lemon Jeffrey and golden goat
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds available in the very near
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright you guys, I want to thank you for
listening to this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it was another podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not up to par with what you expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting my equipment all dialed back
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we will get on those grow lessons
like I keep talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just bear with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise you, I will at least entertain
you if you don't learn a lot from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lot of fun on this episode.
