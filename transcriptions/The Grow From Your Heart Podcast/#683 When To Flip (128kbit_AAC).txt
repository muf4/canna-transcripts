[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need is right
there on the screen and you know I do
[SPEAKER_00]: include a link in the show notes and in
the video description to make it nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: easy for all of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: This of course is the part of the podcast
where I invite you to join the discord
[SPEAKER_00]: server.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an iRegenetics Grow From Your
Heart podcast discord server and you are
[SPEAKER_00]: invited.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a link in the show notes and in
the video description and I hope to see
[SPEAKER_00]: you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's not waste too much time
with the long intro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to make an update before I get
too far on a previous episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a previous episode, I was talking about
saving money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave a bunch of tips and advice on
saving money in your grow room,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I forgot one major component that may
help you save some money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's think about kilowatt hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Electricity is cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cheaper at off peak hours in most
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in a semi-large city.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that after peak hours, electricity
gets cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not run your grow lights at night
when the sun goes down, when all the
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses close, when most of the people
go to bed, your grow lights come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way the light is a little bit cheaper
to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't sound like a big cost cutter,
but the more lights you're running,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more hours you've got them on,
the more money you will save.
[SPEAKER_00]: What goes along with running the lights in
the dark time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got the dark time is now the
daytime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your normal daytime.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dark in your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the sun goes down, your lights come
on in the grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you don't need as much air
conditioning because it's not as hot
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're helping yourself out in a couple
of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need as many fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need as much air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have as much dehumidification to
be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not as much competition with other
equipment and natural elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I completely missed it when I said,
uh, let's run the lights at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm caught up now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that was really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the kilowatts are cheaper,
run them at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then another thing that I should mention,
it is becoming winter time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are going to choose to
pull in cold air from outside to cool off
[SPEAKER_00]: their grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good idea, but don't bring in too
cold of air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to introduce icicles into
your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great way to cause problems and
encourage powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those were two things that I thought I
should include in the last episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got excited, got carried away,
left some shit out, wanted to make sure to
[SPEAKER_00]: get that into this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me give you an update on what has been
going on in my world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels comfortable to start the show by
talking about what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll work our way casually into the
grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been pulling seeds from the buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following along,
you know that I did have an outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest that in my opinion was very
successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave a huge shout out to the crew that
helped me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, guys and gals can't forget the
lovely females that help us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been pulling the seeds from those
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a few days to get the buds nice
and dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then of course I needed to find a moment
to dedicate time to getting those seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get them super dry in a container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, then I just crunch them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put on rubber gloves and crunch the buds
up basically into a dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I run the seeds through the grow easy
seed sorting machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the easy seed or grow easy,
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't pay me to advertise for them,
but I've got a seed separating machine
[SPEAKER_00]: that does save me quite a bit of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, run the seeds through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then immediately after that, they go
through a seed counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I spent most of the afternoon pulling
seeds and running them through the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The numbers were, in my opinion,
quite impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, my friends that grew outdoors said
that next year it will be double because
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants will be larger, will be more
prepared, do more tricks and tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year was a test run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was more than satisfied, really excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some new stuff in those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some old stuff in those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, many people have been asking if those
were the feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they are not feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not do feminized seeds outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fem seeds are a little bit more work.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was my first run in a greenhouse
environment, breeding outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to do fem seeds outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is two, uh, obstacles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to do regular male, female seeds
with a male plant and a female plant
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, less, less, uh, less what's the word
variables is what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more likely for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to learn outdoors with reg
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll keep the fem seeds indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That works.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, people were asking if these were
the orange gazums and the lemon Jefferies
[SPEAKER_00]: and the golden goats.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, unfortunately for you, they were not,
uh, there was, I guess it is time to
[SPEAKER_00]: announce a couple more of the things that
were in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I made more, uh, strawberry
starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made more of the sun kiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made more blue raspberry truffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are looking for the BRT.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is being recent restocked to most of
the vendors as we speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made more, uh, lady marmalade.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those also are being sent to the
vendors as we speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been looking for them,
check the vendor list on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may have them by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in this run, I made two new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That have been named soccer souffle and
the machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've already been made.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a bunch more so that we can release
them and put these out to the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soccer souffle and the machine are
officially made.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have been asking a lot of questions
about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do full complete podcast episodes
on soccer souffle and the machine closer
[SPEAKER_00]: to the release time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were working on getting that released.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am working on getting those seeds
released.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I made artwork for the packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: The packaging is being, uh, I threw
together an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a real artist that can do real
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work for the packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're putting real art together for
packaging designs for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've got to package the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's basically what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: The art is in the works and the packaging
is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we will plan an official release,
an official drop date for soccer souffle
[SPEAKER_00]: and the machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will tell you all about what those
names mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of my friends, excuse me for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of my friends already know what
soccer souffle and what the machine means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you've been asking, is it this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you're probably correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is everything you're assuming that
those strains are named after,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when you hear them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should make it a little bit more
obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know what I'm talking about
at this point, we will reveal it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'll tell you everything about soccer
souffle and the machine in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, those are being planned for an
official drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was more stuff in that, uh,
that run also that does need to be tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made some brand new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've got some new crosses in there
that I've never bred to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's just tease one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pollinated the P 91 clone with an arise
mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the arise was the mail in the
greenhouse, just in case you haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: caught on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't aren't familiar with my
crosses, but the arise King Solomon arise
[SPEAKER_00]: mail was the mail in the greenhouse and he
pollinated the P 91 clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've got a good name for that
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being sent out as testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, people are getting a lot of stuff as
testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, I hit the P 91 with your rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll reveal more stuff as time goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I did mention testers, a lot of
people are going to ask how to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a full podcast episode about being
a tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please listen to that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then reach out if you would like to test
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I want to say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've mentioned several strains on this
podcast that I made.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not revealed everything that was
made in that greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're getting testers, don't think
that just cause I've mentioned something
[SPEAKER_00]: on the show that that's what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have tester seeds from the run
before they could be testers from the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be testers from, uh,
an indoor run.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be anything that you're testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to keep the testing a little bit
secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what you've got, but you probably
don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, don't think that just because I'm
talking about P 91 to arise that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got the testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are about six things out there being
tested right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are going to start seeing
the testing pop up on the discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advertise the discord one more time on the
discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a, uh, seed tester tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I read genetics tester or Rasta
Jeff's testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real easy to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm asking all of my testers to post
their test pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their stories, their grow reports right
there on the discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it easy for me to find,
and it makes it transparent for the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're thinking about buying a strain,
you can see it from the testing from all
[SPEAKER_00]: the other people that are growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see what it's going to be like in
their environment, their experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're interested, check it out on
the discord under the I read genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: tester section.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you haven't jumped on the discord
now and you're a tester, please do jump on
[SPEAKER_00]: the discord and join the tester tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would appreciate seeing your posts
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's brand new, so I'm patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's get that going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let me get myself back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saka Souffle and the machine are coming
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, P 91 to arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's got a good name.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the fun parts about,
uh, making new crosses is naming all the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's all I've got for that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did mention, uh, the FEM seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have been asking for orange,
Gazum, lemon, Jeffrey, and golden goat,
[SPEAKER_00]: feminine seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also people that are, uh, in the know that
have been paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that are in the loop have been
asking for the red pill and the blue pill,
[SPEAKER_00]: which may get renamed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been tossing around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got new names for them in my mind,
but they may just stay red pill and blue
[SPEAKER_00]: pill because it kind of stuck right at
this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why fucking change it?
[SPEAKER_00]: But they may have hashtags or subnames or
taglines or something with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I'm rambling again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be the theme of the show,
but if you've been asking for those
[SPEAKER_00]: feminine seeds, you will be happy to know
that the clones are cut and the plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not very big yet, but be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those clones have been cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they are coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me, I want to say 150 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying 120 to 150.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 days because that's a good timeframe
that gives me time to get all the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that needs to happen done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, also good things come to those who
wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way to rush these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to grow at the rate they're
going to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to pollinate them when it's
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, all I can say is be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been being quite patient for quite
a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, just keep waiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise they're coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does segue me into my next note.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few days ago while I was working in my
grow space, I discovered an ugly furry
[SPEAKER_00]: spider.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's what nightmares are made of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a, he, it could be a she.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I just gender assumed it's gender.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize to the spider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I, it might not even be a spider
for all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm not a scientist or a
Scientologist or an arachnidist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but anyway, there is a creature in my
grow that does look a lot like a spider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and it's ugly and it's creepy and it's
furry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, in California, when I was a little
kid, we called them Mexican jumping
[SPEAKER_00]: spiders because they would ball up into a
little ball and then jump at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he looked at them, they'd freak my
shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't know if that's that I just
culturally appropriate that spider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the future is weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, there's a Mexican jumping spider
that I have decided it's a dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've named it as a boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it bro and I call it dude when I
talk to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, blame me if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I've developed a relationship with
this spider and I can't bring myself to
[SPEAKER_00]: kill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as he doesn't fuck with me,
I won't fuck with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it stays a few feet from me wherever I
move in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of keep an eye on it and I'm like,
where are you motherfucker?
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time I move around, so does he.
[SPEAKER_00]: He seems to know where I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: He stays away from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't want anything to do with me
just like I don't want anything to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: him, but I don't want to kill it because I
haven't seen a fungus net in there since
[SPEAKER_00]: that spider popped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's working security.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's doing me some favors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's earning his space.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's paying rent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am not killing him.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question to you is how do you feel
about a spider in your grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a polite looking spider.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not a cuddly fucking friendly looking
spider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, he is what nightmares
are fucking made of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an ugly spider and sorry spider.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you hear this, you're fucking ugly,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably think I'm ugly too,
but how do you guys feel about a spider in
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you leave a spider in the grow space?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if this spider is harmful to
humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't do any research on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that he stayed away from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that spider wants nothing to
do with me and it knows where I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I move a plant over here,
it goes that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's always up near the top of the
canopy so I can find him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He likes the light and I think he's just
waiting for the fungus gnats to go up to
[SPEAKER_00]: the light and then come down and then eats
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I think he's got a good strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There haven't been any other bugs in there
and I've been, I usually spray for pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spray pesticides once a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't sprayed because I've seen him in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to kill him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that's kind of, that's his
little playground.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how long he's going to live,
how long that spider breed lasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if it has a bunch of babies and I
have a bunch of fucking spiders in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if it's a mama spider and I'm calling
it bro this whole time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I've got a spider in the grow and
it seems to be working security because
[SPEAKER_00]: there are no other bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular type of spider doesn't
make a lot of webs.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not a webby spider.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen any webs or any messes in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you, how do you react?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you respond to a spider in your
grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like a praying mantis.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like ladybugs,
which in my opinion, ladybugs are lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to release ladybugs in
your grow, release a more aggressive
[SPEAKER_00]: predator, something that's going to be
worth its money, worth its time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladybugs die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladybugs die very quickly in the grow
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them end up in your fan and your
ductwork and you got to sweep them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you step on them and then they make
that crunchy poppy noise and you feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: shit about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also stink so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, they are a vector for diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bring their own problems with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them are harvested here in the
Rocky Mountain regions and they're sent
[SPEAKER_00]: all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're taking a Rocky Mountain ladybug
species and putting it all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: country, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not the world, but all over the
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't want to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not going to thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a more aggressive, more appropriate
predator is what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how do you feel about the spider?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been rambling long enough about him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you kill that spider or do you not?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know all the hippie girls are going,
don't kill the spider.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's peaceful in there, but I want to
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a production area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want it clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want it safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also he's paying rent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's eating more bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a lot of rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long have I been going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Long enough to work my way into the
question that I want to present you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking a lot about when is the
first day of flip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always, and I'm going to say it again,
just because I want to put it out there
[SPEAKER_00]: one more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day one of flower is when you change the
timer to 1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You decide when day one is you turn the
timer to 1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, let me, let me regroup and resay
this again in an indoor grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day one of flowering is when you turn the
timer to 12 hours on and 12 hours off or
[SPEAKER_00]: something similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be 1113 or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But day one is when you change that timer,
not any other time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people want to wait till they see
pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people want to do that and then count
10 days after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a fucking math equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day one is the day we change the timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do a math equation?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no algebra involved here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that being said, the next question is
when do I flip?
[SPEAKER_00]: When?
[SPEAKER_00]: When do I flip?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I know when it is time to flip my
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I know?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really, really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of knowing when to flip your plants
is understanding your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another big part about knowing when to
flip your plants is understanding how much
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants are going to stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understanding the stretch of the flowering
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that for just a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I mean by the stretching phase?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we change that timer to 1212,
we have now told the plant it is flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The end is near.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an annual plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to live for one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally it would get a spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would get a summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the late summer, the time, the daylight
hours would get shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tells the plant, oh, the winter is
near.
[SPEAKER_00]: I better flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant wants to make flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowers are the parts we are after.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to smoke the dried flower tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant's main goal is to receive pollen
so that it can get pollinated,
[SPEAKER_00]: make seeds, and grow again next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we turn our timer to 1212 to tell
the plant to begin to flower, it starts
[SPEAKER_00]: stretching.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a natural part of turning to
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants just naturally stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some strains will stretch more than
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be a tongue twister if I had
one more dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: But research the strains you are growing
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of my strains straight up will
double in height, which means you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: flower your plants when they are halfway
to your maximum height.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me use a good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your grow space is six feet tall,
let's say that you've got a six foot tall
[SPEAKER_00]: grow space, you've got to deduct the
height of the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say that from the floor to your
light is six feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got six feet of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep in mind that we need space
between the light and the top of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: when we finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've worked ourselves down to five
feet, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds about right in most
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get about a foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to go 18 inches, two feet
from the light, depending on your light,
[SPEAKER_00]: your air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So allow yourself that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just stick with 18 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got, we had six feet,
you've got four and a half feet of growth
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants are going to, now let's
also think you've got a pot that's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to take six or 10 inches off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say you've got four feet of
actual growth space now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say veg the plants until they are
two feet tall, maybe a little bit taller,
[SPEAKER_00]: then flip them into flower mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants double in size, they will
finish at four feet tall, which leaves you
[SPEAKER_00]: a few inches height for the pot,
which leaves you about a foot or 18 inches
[SPEAKER_00]: from your light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ideally you would flower when your
plants are about halfway to your maximum
[SPEAKER_00]: height.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are variables in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I did mention, some plants are going
to stretch a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants won't stretch very much,
depending on your light spectrum,
[SPEAKER_00]: your light intensity, the kind of light
you've got that may contribute or
[SPEAKER_00]: attribute to how much your plants do
stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a lot of really good light,
they won't stretch as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants aren't getting the right
light, the right light spectrum,
[SPEAKER_00]: the right intensity, the right time
period, they may stretch a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting up there looking for the
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why your plants are stretching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be prepared for anticipate a double
stretch when you're flowering a plant for
[SPEAKER_00]: the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are other things that you need
to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you want to spread that plant out a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to run out of vertical space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's grow it horizontally.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a plant that's stretching
out of control, you can grab it and bend
[SPEAKER_00]: it over and tie it down so it doesn't get
as tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the branches are going to start
growing up around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still going to go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the plant naturally wants to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can learn how to control it and
keep it down so you can veg a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to flower right away that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing we should think about is
topping.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we top the plants, we're allowing it
to grow into a nice even canopy,
[SPEAKER_00]: a nice bush.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took that main top out so those lower
branches can catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let all of that stuff fill your canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let all of that stuff fill your grow
space, then flip it so that way you can
[SPEAKER_00]: get all those bottom branches all even.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll get you evened out so you don't
have one big bud close to the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get that one big bud and bend it
over, or you can cut out the top and let
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottoms recover.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do things to fill that space
before you get one bud right up to the top
[SPEAKER_00]: of the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I was talking about bending plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's over and breaking shit off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that popping and twisting our
plants really slow down that vertical
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a full episode about popping and
twisting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to put a link to that in the show
notes in the video description.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can click right on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you popping and twisting
technique that does slow down the vertical
[SPEAKER_00]: growth because the plants are spending
their energy repairing that pop and twist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will not slow down or damage our
buds in any way because at this point
[SPEAKER_00]: there are no buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are just shifting their
hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going from veg to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're basically going through puberty.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need a couple of weeks for their
hormones to adjust, then they'll start
[SPEAKER_00]: making buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, crack them, pop them,
twist them, abuse them, get them short,
[SPEAKER_00]: get them the shape you want so that when
they start building buds they're right in
[SPEAKER_00]: the position we need them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I did just say that it's best to grow
those plants up until you've got them
[SPEAKER_00]: halfway and fill your space, but it is not
necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I run new plants, plants I've never
grown before, plants that I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're gonna do, I don't want to
waste time, space, and energy,
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, water, lights, all of the
above.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that stuff, real estate,
space, it's all very expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all very precious to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I'm running new stuff,
I don't run those plants very big at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put them in a beer cup or a six inch net
pot and I honestly veg them until they are
[SPEAKER_00]: about maybe six, eight inches tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I flower them and I don't do anything
to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't top them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do any manipulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let them grow because I simply want to
see what those seeds do, what I made new
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds what do these plants do,
what did I create?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they grow beautiful plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they grow a bunch of mutants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a bunch of intersex trash?
[SPEAKER_00]: What did I create?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it grow tall and skinny?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it grow short and squat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it make cool colors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I just make a bunch of hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a bunch of great trichome content
coming out of there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to know what I made so I
just grow little tiny plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't think that you have to grow giant
plants, but you can grow them about
[SPEAKER_00]: halfway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flip when you are ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I really like to run new plants
really small the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see people throwing away plants that are
like three and four feet tall and then
[SPEAKER_00]: like turns out it was a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, why did it ever get that
big?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have flowered it when it was
this big and then put it back into veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for you guys that are listening,
this big was the size of a GI Joe.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Four inches tall, three and three
quarters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could have flowered it when it was
that big.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll show you sex, put it right back in
veg, then keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a male, toss it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't waste your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I'm running small stuff,
I really do prefer tiny pots, tiny plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's no need to run big old
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what I do is let's say that I've got
a commercial environment and I can run a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put a tray of plants underneath
one light, like fill a four by four,
[SPEAKER_00]: a five by five section with just a tray of
small plants that we can water the tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put a pump that waters the tray every
day, two times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't even have to go there very
often.
[SPEAKER_00]: The commercial grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just pop in once a week and make sure
shit's running.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get my grow report, take my pictures and
get out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good way to do a phenol hunt,
a test run, just a little sample run to
[SPEAKER_00]: see what you got going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me recap here because I did get
quite rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: A really easy way to determine when to
flip your plants is when they are
[SPEAKER_00]: approximately half the height of your
maximum grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do have to keep in mind that you've
got a pot underneath them, going to raise
[SPEAKER_00]: them up 10 to 12, maybe 14 inches,
depending on the size of your pot and the
[SPEAKER_00]: height of your pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you do have to consider the height
between or the distance between your light
[SPEAKER_00]: and the top of your canopy, depending on
what kind of light you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will need more space.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some of my grow environments,
I've got the old school ducted lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got, it's an HPS light with glass and
a duct on it and a blower so that the heat
[SPEAKER_00]: from that light never makes it to my
canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: My plants can get quite close to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: At a commercial grow in Colorado Springs,
we're using gavitas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't get very close to the gavitas
because the plants will sizzle and burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not supposed to burn them until you
dry and cure them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to stay at least like 16,
18 inches away from those gavitas,
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 inches as fucking scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants start looking like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then some of the LEDs, depending on the
intensity, the spectrum, you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: really close or really far away with some
of the LEDs, depending on what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that case, keeping the plants the
distance from the light, I would
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely recommend most of those lights
are going to come with a recommendation
[SPEAKER_00]: from the manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow that, but go too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the plant, most of you are limited on
ceiling height.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go as high as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn the light to about 50% and see how
the plants react.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go closer and more intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better for the plants to show you I
want more light than for the plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: say, hey, I've had too much light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reaction from less light is way easier
to fix than the reaction from too much
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got one more detail that I should
add.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being a very experienced grower who's done
this for a long time, let me say that you
[SPEAKER_00]: are expecting eight, maybe nine weeks
until harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give yourself an extra week or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allow room and height for an extra week or
two of growth that you're not expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants need to grow longer than
you're going to allow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not done yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you think they're done, they're not
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every new grower wants to cut down early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give yourself the extra time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give yourself the extra height.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you allow the extra height,
you eliminate the excuse of they are too
[SPEAKER_00]: tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to cut them early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allow them to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plan ahead for that extra height.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super frustrating later in a grow
when you're trying to figure out how to
[SPEAKER_00]: bend these branches over and lower shit
because you've only got 10 more days,
[SPEAKER_00]: but everything's growing into the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to figure out, am I going to
turn down the light?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I turn?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I tip the light?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I turn the light fucking sideways?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I bend this fucking branch over?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always such a frustrating 10 days if
you don't prepare for that last bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give yourself plenty of space between the
top of your plant and your light plan
[SPEAKER_00]: ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably flip about half of your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually grow my plants to about I'm six
foot five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually grow my plants about knee high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I flower them in a three gallon
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get about they get topped once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow till they're about knee high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I flower them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They finish out about maybe my just below
my chest area, low chest area.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just about perfect for an indoor
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps, hoes, friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: foes, smokers, growers, clone cutters,
pollen, chuckers, all of you beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis enthusiasts out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you once again for
listening to another episode of the Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say episode 600, 683, it makes me
feel weird and great inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing to think you guys have stuck
around for 683 episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we do 683 more together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the words of encouragement,
all of the compliments keep me going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will reconsider reading some of the
YouTube comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys did kind of encourage me to read
those YouTube comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outnumber the trolls, fill my inbox,
fill my comment section up with positive
[SPEAKER_00]: words of encouragement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just totally wash out the trolls and I'll
go read them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the deal I'll make with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys boost me up, fill it up with
love and positivity and make it to where I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't even see all the troll comments,
then I'll go check.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something else I should mention,
a lot of the troll comments don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: make it to the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to review them, so only I get to
read all the abusive shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to decline it and tell YouTube,
don't post that abusive shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of them have to go through me for
review before you even get to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, you guys sent me a lot of great
messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saying, bro, just read the comments
because we love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to support you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill those comments up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will read them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just outnumber those silly trolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's wrap up this show before I
dig that hole any deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions, corrections,
comments or concerns, you know that I
[SPEAKER_00]: would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email address is of course grow from
your heart at hotmail.com.

[SPEAKER_00]: Please do reach out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, don't forget about the Discord
server.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a great thing happening on the
Discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ends around Halloween.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a trick or treat thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do check out the Discord for more
details and information.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a link to the Discord and the
show notes and the video description,
[SPEAKER_00]: but to make it nice and easy, just go to
my website, iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the links you need are right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are vendor links, the Discord link,
the newsletter link.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all right there.

[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: My throat is telling me it is time to wrap
up the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to say good night for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back in a couple of days with
fresh new content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give a giant shout out to my buddy
Made While Medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see you in the next one.
