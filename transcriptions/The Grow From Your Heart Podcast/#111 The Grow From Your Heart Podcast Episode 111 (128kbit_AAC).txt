celebrating this season, I hope you have a
[SPEAKER_08]: great holiday.

some good turps.

edibles.

know that what I'm paying for is going to
[SPEAKER_08]: give me a nice fat dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that I can rely on Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't trust your dab to a rig made in
China by a Chinese child without proper
[SPEAKER_08]: eye protection or adequate pay,

just as hard as you and I.

[SPEAKER_08]: It gives me big fat rips.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got it hooked up to the e-nail.

couple of seconds and I'm going to take a
[SPEAKER_08]: couple of fat dabs.

happen down there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I hope they're taking a shot for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to take like two shots
between the five.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to fall asleep.

[SPEAKER_03]: days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just put it that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot it was something we could bring

who was on the phone?
[SPEAKER_08]: What did I say?
[SPEAKER_08]: Phone.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how high I am over there on the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_08]: The guy that I just met last night,

[SPEAKER_08]: This is the guy we call the Clear
Scientist.
[SPEAKER_08]: My buddy, Chris.
[SPEAKER_08]: How you doing, brother?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm doing excellent yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am high as shit, dude.

[SPEAKER_08]: Well, thanks for joining me on the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here comes a beautiful Miss Stansel
sneaking through.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: And here's a guy I just met today.
[SPEAKER_08]: This guy's name's Brian.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got a really fantabulous long name.
[SPEAKER_08]: What do they call you, my friend?
[SPEAKER_08]: The Mad Alchemist.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Mad Alchemist.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have an Instagram that you like?
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have people to stalk you on while
they're listening to the show?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you're low-key.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of like a low-key kind of dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hear you're into some cool shit,
so we may open the doors to talk about
[SPEAKER_08]: some of that stuff here in the near
future.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do like cool shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hear that you two, Chris and Brian,
are like the hash mad scientists.
[SPEAKER_07]: People say that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of just a good- I'll go ahead
and say that.
[SPEAKER_08]: They are, yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I ask about the product that I heard
about a minute ago, the Mother's Milk?
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I ask you guys about that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you ready to talk about that on a
podcast, or is that something we have to
[SPEAKER_08]: keep on the down low?
[SPEAKER_02]: We can talk about it, sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to hear about that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll reveal what they can.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I ask too many questions, just tell me
I'm out of line.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really mostly this guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a water-soluble hash oil solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: You make the solution, so you say,
oh, this has got five or 10 milligrams per
[SPEAKER_02]: milliliter of solutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you're going to have a little test
tube or some volumetric flask or something
[SPEAKER_02]: and measure out exactly how many
milligrams you're going to want to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it's potent and it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: It lasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we all want to try some of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hunt likes the Dr. Pepper mix.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just going to say I would like to
drop some in my Dr. Pepper.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hear it hits you within 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're sooner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's definitely the 24th flavor in
there for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: The 24th flavor in my Dr. Pepper.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long does it last like a normal
edible?
[SPEAKER_02]: Consensus.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can stay awake long enough.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can stay awake.
[SPEAKER_07]: Compare the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you take enough, it lasts a really long
time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hunt, would you like to testify on this
matter?
[SPEAKER_08]: There's milk.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to bring to the mic our buddy
Hunt, the Grammy Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's hanging out in the room.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's tell us a little bit about what
happens when you have consumed the
[SPEAKER_08]: Mother's Milk.
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you like this stuff?
[SPEAKER_04]: Straight from the teat.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a smokeless, immediate type of
effect where literally after three or four
[SPEAKER_04]: sips or a couple straws worth,
you can feel it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If the drink is potent enough,
within five to ten minutes, you're at
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty much euphoria.
[SPEAKER_04]: It also compounds itself or some sort of
multiplier where if there's 60 milligrams
[SPEAKER_04]: in the cup, it really feels like 200
milligrams when you drink it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some batches in the R&D phase were
extremely terapy and unpleasant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other batches have been refined into
perfection.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for your testimony, kind sir.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you ever want to grab a mic,
just jump in, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you're hanging out over there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Enjoy yourself.
[SPEAKER_08]: Squad up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess the golden question is,
do you bring any of this shit,
[SPEAKER_08]: bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I failed on that front, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know I was coming into a couple
hours ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've gotten over an hour drive home and
it's snowing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be a bobsled ride getting
down this mountain where we are.
[SPEAKER_08]: This place is beautiful, but getting down
tonight in the dark.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, how about the deer?
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody else experience the deer?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we did experience the deer.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was some crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I grew up in Ohio, lived in Colorado here
for a couple years.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we lived down here in Colorado
Springs, I always knew the deers to be
[SPEAKER_06]: pretty damn friendly and fearless,
but this motherfucker was trying to get in
[SPEAKER_06]: on the cipher or some shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: He backed down like eight of us sitting
around smoking in a circle.
[SPEAKER_07]: This fool came over, startled us,
and we slowly walked back to the house.
[SPEAKER_06]: He literally backed us into a corner.
[SPEAKER_06]: Into the door.
[SPEAKER_06]: We pulled up into the driveway.
[SPEAKER_08]: He stopped in front of the cars and looked
at us like, you got the pass or what?
[SPEAKER_08]: Then he came up to my window like 10
bucks.
[SPEAKER_07]: He looked at me in the eye.
[SPEAKER_07]: He looked at my joint.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that dude was serious.
[SPEAKER_07]: He looked at me in the eye again.
[SPEAKER_07]: I dropped the joint.
[SPEAKER_06]: At one point I bent down to put the blunt
out.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what you bent over for,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: He got ready to charge though.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was ready.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was like a four point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice four point, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he's like an eight point.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a big boy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Chris, what was he?
[SPEAKER_08]: He was an eight pointer.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was an eight point buck, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you what.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought about wrangling him myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chris was going to give him a grapple.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, Chris, tornado.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who said they wanted to grab by the horns?
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you guys was serious about?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to get them by the horns.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to wrestle them.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd love to have seen that.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it comes back tonight, I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know jujitsu, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to get them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can play the spoons and the washboard
too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jujitsu don't work on deer, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's what she said.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I even ask you about the clear?
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I allowed to ask?
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you want to know?
[SPEAKER_08]: What can you tell me about the clear?
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of my listeners, this is listened to
by people from all over the world,
[SPEAKER_08]: not just people in Colorado or Cali that
know what's up.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of the people listening have a hard
time finding pot.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the clear, if you just want to tell
them kind of basically, they probably know
[SPEAKER_08]: about shatter and basic hashes from
listening.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you want to give them an update on
what the clear actually is, that'd be
[SPEAKER_08]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: So clear is a brand of product that we
started a couple of years ago in
[SPEAKER_07]: California.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was sort of the first, I guess,
popularized purified cannabis oil that we
[SPEAKER_07]: coined the name the clear because it was
always a nice high clarity and low color.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're one of the first, quote,
solvent free companies that existed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so people have their own ways of
making these activated cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_07]: decolorized and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we don't really speak to how we do
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We like to just keep it always a secret.
[SPEAKER_07]: Much respect.
[SPEAKER_07]: So other people do it and tell you how
they do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But as far as us, we kind of stick to just
a purification method.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have our own particulars as to what
machines we use.
[SPEAKER_07]: We build a lot of our own machines and
have our own processes and things like
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of just particulars.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have our own unique flavors that we
then will blend back in all natural
[SPEAKER_07]: flavors that can range from cannabis type
flavors that have high terpene content to
[SPEAKER_07]: like your standard strawberry or grape.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have sort of a flavor department
that we pump out different flavors and try
[SPEAKER_08]: to keep those flavors derived from
cannabis or other products.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're all derived from other
products.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything's natural.
[SPEAKER_07]: And none of them are like every like,
you know, for instance, the terpenes that
[SPEAKER_07]: we use are steam distilled and all the
flavors we use are, you know, high grade
[SPEAKER_07]: and are all, you know, based off of like,
you know, a lot of essential oils and,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, things like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have, you know, Chinese things and
we try to make sure that these are like
[SPEAKER_07]: the highest grade stuff, nothing Chinese
sourced.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've talked to you for a couple of nights
and I trust you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I trust your judgment on that kind of
product so far.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, there's a lot of,
you know, great uses for products like
[SPEAKER_07]: this.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can use them for topicals and edibles
and vapor cartridges and anything you can
[SPEAKER_07]: really want to, you know, formulate.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hear a lot of good things about the
clear.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll have to get our hands on some hunt,
hunt.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's your department.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: A few people that have it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just in Denver, not in the Springs
yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I got to drive to Denver to get it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are slowly making our, our
distribution.
[SPEAKER_07]: Through Colorado, bigger and wider.
[SPEAKER_08]: So greener green and healthy wellness is
interested, I think.
[SPEAKER_08]: To put that together.
[SPEAKER_08]: The boss is behind me laughing.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, Hey, wait, how can you say
that?
[SPEAKER_08]: You do the grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll do the managing.
[SPEAKER_08]: You shut your face.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jordan, what's up with turpax bro?
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey dude, thanks for the update on the
clear.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up with the turpax brother?
[SPEAKER_06]: We are, you know, we're doing recreational
processing up in Denver right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're still doing medical processing down
here in Colorado Springs and have a pretty
[SPEAKER_06]: large grow that is about to be up and
running for our medical wholesale.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, gonna have a lot of really awesome
flavors that we're going to be making out
[SPEAKER_06]: of there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything that gets grown in that
facility has to be extracted.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so, you know, we'll have a lot of,
uh, really, really awesome turps on the
[SPEAKER_06]: market.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has to be extracted.
[SPEAKER_06]: Has to be extracted.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing wrong with turps.
[SPEAKER_06]: Full plant runs.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, then also, you know, it's going to be
a pretty exciting month.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are going out to Illinois in the middle
of this month and we are doing some
[SPEAKER_06]: consulting out there with one of the first
operators to get up and running,
[SPEAKER_06]: um, for medical cannabis in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to be going out there to,
uh, extract their crop and, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: help get their processing operation going,
help them with some of the, um,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, processing preparation,
you know, trimming and all that kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Expand the brand.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not, that's not really a brand
situation.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the market in, um, in Illinois
is very small.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's more of like a consultation help,
you know, kind of do like a co-brand
[SPEAKER_06]: private label type situation where we go
out there and help create their brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, which is, you know, one of the first,
you know, they'll have some of the first,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, infused products available in the
Illinois medical cannabis market and
[SPEAKER_06]: probably, you know, be some of the first
legal butane extractions to be done in
[SPEAKER_06]: that state.
[SPEAKER_06]: If not the first, um, we're also going to
be, uh, getting up and running in Las
[SPEAKER_06]: Vegas within the next month, which,
uh, should also be very exciting.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that'll be right about when this comes
out.
[SPEAKER_08]: This will probably come out in about two
or three weeks.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that'll be right when this drops.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, hopefully that will be,
uh, right around the time, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: around the first of the year where we're
getting up and running in Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_06]: That will be, uh, you know, turpex branded
products that we're going to be,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, selling wax, shatter,
vape pens, things like that, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: throughout the Las Vegas market are,
uh, California, you know, we, we
[SPEAKER_06]: originally came out here from California
and it'll be pretty awesome because now
[SPEAKER_06]: California patients will have access to
the products that we make again,
[SPEAKER_06]: because, uh, Nevada has reciprocal medical
marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_06]: So anybody, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Reciprocity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Reciprocity.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to Dan for going to English
class.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a grammar lesson that we'll get
into later.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're in Vegas and you have a
California medical marijuana card,
[SPEAKER_08]: you can shop at a Vegas dispensary.
[SPEAKER_06]: You shop at a Vegas dispensary,
Reno, any Nevada medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_06]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your Colorado card there as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys heard that go to Vegas and take
your medical marijuana card and go
[SPEAKER_08]: shopping, get some herb.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: They are up and running out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, go get some turpex at the
first of the year, dab it out.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll let you guys know where the drops are
happening.
[SPEAKER_08]: How much of, uh, of the, so you guys are
talking about nug runs.
[SPEAKER_08]: All of the room you're growing has to be
made into Earl.
[SPEAKER_08]: What percentage of that?
[SPEAKER_08]: And if there's, if I'm at a line,
just let me know and I won't ask the
[SPEAKER_08]: question, how much of that product will
actually be sold as smokeable Earl and how
[SPEAKER_08]: much of it will be sold to a vendor and
turned into something like a topical or an
[SPEAKER_08]: edible or something?
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say a hundred percent of that will
be sold as smokeable oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you know, it's, we, you know,
we, we take pretty, we take pretty good
[SPEAKER_06]: steps in the grow to make sure that,
you know, we have the, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: really high quality.
[SPEAKER_06]: We wish we were able to let people,
you know, experience the flowers,
[SPEAKER_06]: but the fact that we can take all that
high quality flower product and turn it
[SPEAKER_06]: into extracts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you know, we want to get as much of
that branded turpex, awesome nug run.
[SPEAKER_06]: And flavor on the market as possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would say most of that product will
be sold as smokeable oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we start delving into other products
and find that, you know, it's more
[SPEAKER_06]: beneficial to do things that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we're working into that now,
but right now the plan is to just make,
[SPEAKER_06]: shatter wax, live resin, maybe some bubble
hash, live resin.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to talk about live resin for a
minute?
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard you say something to a client
earlier.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, the bottom line, bro, what makes it
live resident and what doesn't just so
[SPEAKER_08]: it's, I've said this on the show and
people call me a hater.
[SPEAKER_08]: What makes it live resin?
[SPEAKER_06]: The fact that it's a live plant that's cut
down and then frozen before it is dried.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then what machine do you run it
through?
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, we personally, we use an emo tech at
our Colorado operations as well as the
[SPEAKER_06]: ones that we'll use in Nevada and
Illinois.
[SPEAKER_08]: See guys, I didn't even say it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't bait him.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just let him say his thing and he
backed up everything I have said.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what the question really comes down to
there are some like little small
[SPEAKER_07]: distinctions in like live resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people will dry like a slight bit and
then freeze versus like a full dry.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you feel?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you consider that any drying?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think it's the immediate cut and
freeze?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause some people complain about like
tubes clogging up with water and doing
[SPEAKER_07]: fucked up shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I would say live resins really not
meant for a tube.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the, the live resin process,
I just, you know, because, because of the
[SPEAKER_06]: way everything gets clogged and everything
like that, I just would never recommend
[SPEAKER_06]: doing it in a tube.
[SPEAKER_03]: You take the same steps as like fresh
frozen ice water.
[SPEAKER_03]: And instead though, you just blast it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if I do it through like a sweet leaf,
am I still making live resin?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it going to come out the same?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I've never used one.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think theoretically it wouldn't matter.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, uh, you know what machine you use,
it's kind of like a style, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of like the fact that the plant has
not had a chance to dry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the machine's just another
variable that you just got to compensate
[SPEAKER_06]: for to try to get the end product that
you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if the machine operates a little
bit differently, just if you have the
[SPEAKER_06]: experience, you'd figure it out,
adjust it, try to compensate and make,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it's a process.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I don't really think,
you know, live resin is what do you guys
[SPEAKER_07]: prefer as far as like type of now grown,
cured, fresh, dried, fresh, dried.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's certain strains that come out
amazing as live resin that, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: really tastes awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think those are, it's like the tangy
tangies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like tangy lemon, like all those ones
taste amazing as live resin, but all of
[SPEAKER_06]: those tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dry, cured too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the main reason why people like
live resin so much is because the color.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, color brings out a lot of flavor,
but certain types of flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Certain flavors get, get muted down by
like this kind of watery thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's planty, it's vegetative.
[SPEAKER_06]: But certain strains in live resin,
the turps are amplified.
[SPEAKER_06]: And other strains, I feel like,
yeah, other strains, I feel like it takes
[SPEAKER_06]: like a nice, like dry and cure to really
bring out the turps to their like maximum
[SPEAKER_06]: potential.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when that happens,
[SPEAKER_06]: the oil is not going to be as
aesthetically pleasing as if it's cut down
[SPEAKER_06]: early, frozen and extracted in that form.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's going to look piss yellow.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, I've learned to take the plants a
little bit early if I know they're going
[SPEAKER_08]: to be oil.
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes it look so much better.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's definitely a, uh, definitely a tactic
that a lot of growers use these days.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to go around the room.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's your favorite strain to smoke as a
flower and favorite to dab?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just talking to Chris about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: My favorite was always the SFVOG and I
haven't had it in quite some time,
[SPEAKER_03]: but uh, that's my, that's the ultimate in
flower and dab form.
[SPEAKER_08]: The San Fernando Valley OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to, I'm going to, if I ask a
lot of people, if I asked a hundred
[SPEAKER_08]: people, I bet 50 of them, would say the
SFVOG.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: And probably 40 of them didn't smoke the
real one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I have.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure you have.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know who you are, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know who you are, brother.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Chris is thinking about it already.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want us to skip you for a second?
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Brian, favorite strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like smoking, uh, Jack Herrera
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, really any, any African sativa,
I just, I just love the snow cap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Nigerian nightmare type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: All those guys, they just have that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's terpenolene is a common
terpene.
[SPEAKER_02]: There isn't really high prevalence and I
just, I really like those get up and do
[SPEAKER_02]: things during your day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I love to dab that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love to smoke that on flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just, and when it's done right,
it's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be done so well.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to assume that terpenolene is a
terpenoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris, Chris wants to talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to hear about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Terp, terpenolene is one of the isomers of
terp.
[SPEAKER_07]: Terpene.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe it's gamma terp, terp gamma.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, that, um, has a very distinct
smell and is attributed to like the Jack
[SPEAKER_07]: and XJ type smells.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of times can be a very like
overpowering note in like a lemon haze or
[SPEAKER_07]: a silver haze or something like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, very fairly common in like hybridized
cannabis, sativas, um, but very distinct.
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dutch tree.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's, well, you can really,
that's, I think, like, if you're going to
[SPEAKER_07]: get into terp terpenes, that's when you're
going to be able to pick up more than,
[SPEAKER_07]: more than most, most like most people are
going to identify that because it stands a
[SPEAKER_07]: little different than most of the
terpenes, a little less spicy,
[SPEAKER_07]: a little bit more sweet.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's your favorite stream,
bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad you nailed it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to let him hesitate for a
second.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was really fixated on like that old,
old school blueberry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just that.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were talking about that last night.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That DJ short blueberry short style.
[SPEAKER_07]: And is that flower?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to be flower.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the dabs, I've just, we fell in
love with this lemon strain we got that we
[SPEAKER_07]: call lemon grab.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we got, uh, it was apparently,
you know, just passed down through a
[SPEAKER_07]: number of people through, uh, the homey
out at, uh, Orham farms up in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was apparently some 20 year old
lemon from Soma.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it is just a killer strain.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just makes this like just intense
lemon and it has none of the terpenaline
[SPEAKER_07]: taste.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a lot different than,
uh, you know, the common lemons.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we talked about yesterday,
a much different than, uh, no tangy notes,
[SPEAKER_07]: no, um, no, uh, uh, what was that lemon we
were talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, um, uh, age and orange,
death by lemon, lemon, Jeffery,
[SPEAKER_07]: lemon, dot lemon G.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was really cool to have this sort of
like unique lemon strain.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a nice harvest that we grew in
house and made some amazing oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: So those are my favorite strains.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all you, my friend, heavy breather.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean a good perp, you know, granddaddy
perp for granddaddy perp flower and
[SPEAKER_08]: dabbers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, that's a flower, you know,
just blunt swisher sweets at granddaddy
[SPEAKER_06]: perp and call it a day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but you know, granddaddy perps
probably a favorite, but you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: mainly more, you know, I really love,
uh, OG, uh, good OG G cut OG is my
[SPEAKER_06]: particular favorite.
[SPEAKER_07]: How can you hate OGs?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think everyone loves it.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's your favorite?
[SPEAKER_06]: This guy's got a real fruity palette over
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of the room went for the OGs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say the OGs and kems.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And definitely chem.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been going really heavy on like some
chem D's and chem 91's lately.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really liked those a lot as well,
but yeah, mainly, you know, G cut OG
[SPEAKER_06]: flower dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll cook it up from net from time to
time.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a unique thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll get burnt out.
[SPEAKER_08]: If there's too much cookies.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been smoking a lot of gorilla glue
lately.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't have that distinct,
you know, like a good gorilla glue,
[SPEAKER_07]: man.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's got like, you smell that with your
eyes closed.
[SPEAKER_07]: You smell the different notes.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got the distinct.
[SPEAKER_06]: Break it up and you get a little something
different, you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And have you guys compared the,
uh, the gorilla glue number fours with the
[SPEAKER_07]: S ones?
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a couple of packs of the S ones
that we got from, um, the home ain't
[SPEAKER_06]: unknown profit out in California.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have not popped those just yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that we've got this new warehouse
firing off, I think we're going to check
[SPEAKER_06]: them out and, uh, we have the cut of the G
G four.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, so, you know, it'll be, it'll be,
it will be able to do a pretty nice little
[SPEAKER_06]: side by side comparison.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've, I've grown a ton of G G four,
so I'll be able to recognize it a little
[SPEAKER_08]: bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're talking about the granddaddy
purple.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I said, it's not my favorite.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to kind of dis your strain here,
but then I've got the two guys in the room
[SPEAKER_08]: that are going to be able to explain to me
why I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, when I smoke granddaddy perps,
no matter, and it's a lot of purple.
[SPEAKER_08]: Buds do this to me when they're dried and
cured.
[SPEAKER_08]: They taste like they are still wet.
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that, have you experienced that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Or does that make sense to you that it's
tastes like there's moisture in the bud or
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't like the flavor of granddaddy
perps.
[SPEAKER_07]: The moisture content shouldn't be
affected.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this probably not going to be a
moisture thing?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like directly?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't, I don't think it's actually
moisture.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just tastes like wetness or tastes like
sweet top note.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you, a lot of these, like the perps and
like floral, these are kind of just
[SPEAKER_07]: different sort of like floral.
[SPEAKER_07]: Floral top notes, turpinoids, things that
are like a little bit less like
[SPEAKER_07]: elucidated.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would think you link to cannabis,
like sort of spectrum relative to like the
[SPEAKER_07]: symbol terpene.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, you've got like a situation
where, like how they age and how they
[SPEAKER_07]: oxidize is kind of dependent, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And so you may get that effect,
but some people might identify that as
[SPEAKER_07]: like a fresh as fuck smelling.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's almost what it tastes like
every time, even when it's dried and cured
[SPEAKER_08]: properly.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, granddaddy perps, a fickle,
a fickle lady, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that real deal Urkel that I like.
[SPEAKER_06]: The purple Urkel?
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you know, you know, there's
different phenos and cuts and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like there's definitely one that's
like a little bit heavier on like the
[SPEAKER_06]: cardboard terps, which may be kind of what
you're talking about a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of smells like maybe it was cured
in a wet, in a brown paper bag and left in
[SPEAKER_06]: there a little bit too long.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a good kind of GDP as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: That being said though, I don't know where
you were getting a lot of your GDP from,
[SPEAKER_06]: but you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I said true that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, it's all purple bloods,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was this GDP you were growing or was
this GDP?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I've never grown it because I've
never been a fan since the beginning.
[SPEAKER_06]: GDP was a hugely mass produced strain out
of California for quite some period of
[SPEAKER_06]: time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And was one of the, you know, you know,
was one of the earlier ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: Massive commercial style grow warehouses
where they're sending it across the
[SPEAKER_06]: country.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, people wanted it all over.
[SPEAKER_06]: The cure wasn't really part of the
equation in those big, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just get it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just get it going.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well you guys can give me a good cut of
the granddaddy perps.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll grow the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll trim it myself.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll cure it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Super frosty.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good granddaddy perp done right,
I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody in Colorado, California,
give me a cut.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the thing is too, we got purple
leaves, not purple trichomes, if I'm not
[SPEAKER_07]: mistaken, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: This isn't one of those, you know,
a lot of people making these to get the
[SPEAKER_07]: different color bubble coming out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm pretty sure, if I'm not mistaken,
those make mostly purple leaves,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Not in the trichome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have any?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, granddaddy perp,
depending on how it's done, you can have
[SPEAKER_06]: green grapes, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the black cherry kim.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, go for it, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I talk a lot on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to say green grapes are
my favorite.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have the purple leaves, but the green
buds, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: The black cherry kim is well known for its
purple, but one of those green phenotypes
[SPEAKER_08]: is amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one of the keepers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my only, and it's way out of the
purple range is that black cherry kim,
[SPEAKER_08]: it grows purple, but it doesn't taste like
anything else purple.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I wanted to ask though, what happened
to, why did the original turpex Instagram
[SPEAKER_08]: get the kibosh?
[SPEAKER_08]: What happened there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, what'd you do?
[SPEAKER_03]: The suits came in and said, it's time to
clean it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you guys are, you guys are going
too hard and we're going to have to split.
[SPEAKER_06]: How many followers was that?
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you have now?
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, 1500.
[SPEAKER_06]: A few weeks.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They should be down.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've been going hard on people and
people who don't even like really sell
[SPEAKER_07]: anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: We even got so far as to get ahold of
somebody over there and they, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, told us, can't have,
uh, certain information on there that we
[SPEAKER_06]: had on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: What information?
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you help anyone out?
[SPEAKER_06]: Contact information, basically any form of
contact information, any sort of pricing
[SPEAKER_06]: information in terms of anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: No contact.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm opening my Instagram right now to see
if I've got contact info on there because
[SPEAKER_08]: they shut me down at 50, uh, I was at 19 K
and I'm at like 1500 and I feel dumb.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's make a song about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Instagram, stop trying to fuck you.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just want to take nice pictures of weed
and slabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not so bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm telling you there's all kinds of
people on your shit who are selling mean
[SPEAKER_06]: and Xanax on their pages.
[SPEAKER_06]: You should really be worried about them
and not us.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just want to post pictures of weed and
slabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really not so bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why did you take our page?
[SPEAKER_06]: Why did you take Jeff's page?
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish Instagram would focus on all the
people who are selling crack DME for info.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got crack DME for info.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got lean DME for info.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll get you whatever you need.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Instagram, we're coming for you and we're
not taking no for an answer.
[SPEAKER_06]: We will post pictures of our slabs and our
glass and our weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you indeed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to post freely.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the Instagram song, ladies and
gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you guys have a band name or are you
just the Terpy boys?
[SPEAKER_06]: We are Doc Butthole and the Brown Eyes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Doc Butthole and the Brown Eyes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's a great segue.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I think what has been demanded,
uh, Ms. Damsel just walked by and wanted
[SPEAKER_08]: to hear the butthole song.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, is there such a thing as the butthole
song that happens between you two?
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, not necessarily the butthole song.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's just kind of a variety of,
you know, a multitude of multi-platinum
[SPEAKER_06]: tracks.
[SPEAKER_08]: What would it take to get you boys to riff
a little bit of the butthole riff here on
[SPEAKER_08]: the show for me?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it would probably take those five
buttholes that are downstairs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we might have to pause real quick and
come back once we get the whole crew.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: So why don't you, uh, just start strumming
a butthole riff and we'll see if we can
[SPEAKER_08]: tempt this young man to sing some butthole
jams for us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go, ladies and gentlemen,
butthole jam volume one live on the grow
[SPEAKER_08]: from your heart podcast brought to you by
Dan and George.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are growing from our hearts right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what you guys tuned in for.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your life is less important than this
song.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you ever seen a cute little butthole
that you just wanted to maybe paint a
[SPEAKER_06]: picture of it and maybe do some other
things as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you know that we like to lick lots
of buttholes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It tastes so sweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: It tastes kind of like a coconut meat.
[SPEAKER_08]: More recently than I care to admit.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's what a lucky guy to have those
butthole turps for dinner every night.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure she will fight.
[SPEAKER_06]: It shines like a diamond when you're done
because it's so damn clean.
[SPEAKER_06]: Licking butt is serene.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my dream.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I don't lick it for a while,
I get mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets green.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gotta blow off some steam.
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep it clean.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know my favorite string.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's blue dream.
[SPEAKER_06]: Blue dream kinda tastes like a stripper's
ass crack.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am piney.
[SPEAKER_06]: Strippers love blue dream.
[SPEAKER_06]: Strippers love blue dream.
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's one thing I know in my years in
this game, blue dream.
[SPEAKER_06]: Makes strippers go insane.
[SPEAKER_06]: Blue dream.
[SPEAKER_06]: And some glitter on your butthole.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how you know you are smoking that
stripper's delight.
[SPEAKER_06]: Blue dream.
[SPEAKER_06]: Piney.
[SPEAKER_06]: Blue dream.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate blue dream.
Blue dream.
[SPEAKER_06]: Blue dream.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, all right ladies and gentlemen,
you heard it here first, the butthole
[SPEAKER_08]: song.
[SPEAKER_08]: Segwayed into a little bit of blue dream.
[SPEAKER_07]: Into a little bit of late blue dream.
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't heard that performed in at least
as long as I've been alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as he's been a part of R&K.
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard Jimmy played that back in 84.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, fucking Jimmy, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, fucking Jimmy fucking kills it,
man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jimmy Garcia, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I heard he's better than Trey.
[SPEAKER_08]: Way better, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so we've gone a long time and I
want to reward my listeners.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone that's made it through the
butthole song, that's made it all the
[SPEAKER_08]: shenanigans, through the shenanigans.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk about Hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got some amazing Hash artists here
in the room.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone's nice and relaxed.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're all comfortable.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're all friends now.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's coming up with Hash?
[SPEAKER_08]: What's gonna be next?
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got Clear Hash.
Terps.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got dissolvable THC.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone wants the Terps.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can root in our Dr. Pepper.
[SPEAKER_07]: Terps, that's the truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone's talking Terps.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone talks Terps.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't really even know what Terps
means.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, most people don't know what a Terp
is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Terps being flavor.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're gonna call it flavor components.
[SPEAKER_07]: What the flavor is.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a lot going on with Terps and
a lot of different flavors.
[SPEAKER_07]: Terps.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think, you know, I got some people
out there doing some little Terp isolates
[SPEAKER_07]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think the game's gonna be,
you know, sort of just keeping the essence
[SPEAKER_07]: of cannabis so that everyone can
experience it and all the different
[SPEAKER_07]: formulations.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's like a kind of more of an
art than cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're a little bit more stable.
[SPEAKER_07]: And flavors are kind of like an art.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, perfumers and people who do that
sort of extraction have been, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: doing it for a long time and have a lot of
their own methods.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think cannabis hasn't quite matured
to that level of science and it's kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: getting there.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've just now been given the freedom.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were a little, we were prohibited from
doing that experimentation.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so you feel like Terps are
next.
[SPEAKER_08]: You look like you got something important
to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was gonna say, yeah, Terps are good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We definitely have not been inhibited in
doing that because those are all legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so some people have been doing some
research on terpenes for a while and with
[SPEAKER_02]: regard to, I mean, aromatherapy.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people poo poo on that,
but it's definitely real.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the cannabis game, we see that
that's real because it's one of the things
[SPEAKER_02]: that gets us either way that we want to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then also, you know, you use it for
people using lavender oil and stuff like
[SPEAKER_02]: that, just in the little, is it bedside
steamers and stuff like that or whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: the essential essence stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's definitely real.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so incorporating that into cannabis is
pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, keeping that original essence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so coming up with the different
extractions and trying to get just the
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes and then get plants that produce
a lot of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's pretty neat information out
there and theories on how you can
[SPEAKER_02]: influence the terpene levels by soil
management and like environmental controls
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't the only industry where
terpenes are prevalent or where people
[SPEAKER_02]: want the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Terpenes from what we're growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's a lot of literature around
there about different, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: lavender oil, like I said, is a big one,
or like rose hip oil or just all sorts of
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they want to be able to extract those
super efficiently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can look at some of those,
these other industries and follow their
[SPEAKER_02]: lead on how to better extract the stuff
that you want in like an environmentally
[SPEAKER_02]: friendly and easy way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's definitely big and that's going
to be the focus in a big part of the
[SPEAKER_02]: future probably.
[SPEAKER_08]: You said that environmental factors play a
lot into my terpenoids and my soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you're not, you're more on the hash
side than you are the grow game from what
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand about you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Could you give myself and my listeners one
hint on how we could improve our terps in
[SPEAKER_08]: our garden?
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing that we could just stop doing or
start doing that would correct our terps.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got that paper in the car and I
haven't read it yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I printed it out before I drove down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe, maybe the next podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys, you heard it here.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's going to read that and find out.
[SPEAKER_08]: You look like you got something to say,
Jordan.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up with rosin, bro?
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up with rosin, bro?
[SPEAKER_08]: Triple threat.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of my friends listen to this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've tasted one person's rosin that I
liked.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything else tastes like burnt popcorn.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get a lot of the burnt popcorn.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had one guy, my buddy Tim came through
and he had some properly made rosin.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think he made it himself.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was the only one who had rosin that I
liked.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how about that low temp?
[SPEAKER_07]: Low temp, high pressure rosin from bubble.
[SPEAKER_07]: Rosin from sift.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get away from the plant matter.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't want that shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't want the cuticle waxes.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want what's in the heads anyway.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are you pressing it through all the
stuff?
[SPEAKER_07]: Even if you did like a half efficient dry
sift or any kind of other sift,
[SPEAKER_07]: it gets you away from that bulk of the
plant material and that's going to
[SPEAKER_07]: increase your resin quality.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to get a lot less of the
resin stuck in the plant material and
[SPEAKER_07]: overall just going to be more of a
pleasant experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just kind of come up with a reasonable
sift.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dry ice sift or if you can keep the
moisture away.
[SPEAKER_07]: People are building out cold rooms,
going the full length.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can break that material down,
get away from all that leaf.
[SPEAKER_07]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh man, that's a lot of work for a home
grower sometimes.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the most recommended way of getting
some dry sift out of that to work it into
[SPEAKER_08]: rosin?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you can just kind of promptly
break down.
[SPEAKER_07]: They got rotat machines.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got ways of sifting material that
are pretty efficient if you just go about
[SPEAKER_07]: it the right way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I rosin my keef?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, I see a bunch of head nods.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_08]: Done that.
[SPEAKER_08]: How'd that come out?
[SPEAKER_08]: Did it taste like burnt popcorn or since
we didn't use plant matter, did it taste
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It tasted all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean it definitely tastes better than
what comes out of the flour.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, shit in, shit out is a classic
and always the truth when it comes to any
[SPEAKER_07]: process.
[SPEAKER_07]: True, very true.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the truth of hash making.
[SPEAKER_08]: What should I be doing with my reclaim?
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got a drop down that's probably got
... Throwing it away.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just throw it away?
[SPEAKER_07]: Just toss it?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll process that for you for $6 to $12 a
gram.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just kidding.
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't throw anything out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Put it in your oven.
[SPEAKER_07]: Put it in your oven.
[SPEAKER_07]: Heat the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make it into CBN.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make sleepy time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sleepy time, CBN, heat it up, make it in
and then just dab it again or make edibles
[SPEAKER_08]: with it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Dab it, eat it, do whatever.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dab it or eat it.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_07]: Dabbing it a lot will have very little
psychoactivity, but you'll probably find a
[SPEAKER_07]: calming sleepy time effect from it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got a video going and they said,
can we season our nails with reclaim?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why couldn't you, bro?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you totally could.
[SPEAKER_08]: Season that nail.
[SPEAKER_08]: That way you're not wasting a good dab.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or if you're kind of upset with your
buddy, take some of his oil and just kind
[SPEAKER_07]: of use it to clean and make a new nail.
[SPEAKER_07]: When he brings the flame in, it's got
boo-boos, it's got a few tannins.
[SPEAKER_07]: When he's not looking, toss it on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing I've seen recently regarding to
the rosin thing, just jump back to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw a picture on the internet the other
day of someone who had smashed their
[SPEAKER_06]: fingers in the pneumatic.
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a girl because there's girl
fingernails on the remaining fingers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Gross.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were trying to press rosin in one of
those super low temp, high pressure
[SPEAKER_06]: situations and didn't get their fingers
out of the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was not a pretty sight.
[SPEAKER_08]: It looked like you ran over a banana.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was terrible.
[SPEAKER_08]: It looked like you microwaved a hot dog.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just, yeah, that was a mess.
[SPEAKER_06]: Be careful rosin in the home out there,
kids.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of you guys are using, you stole your
girlfriend's hair straightener.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not using a hydraulic press or
anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: To be fair, that, as goofy and stupid as
it works, is pretty damn good for makeup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got no hatred on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could win a cup off that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, the best rosin I've tried was
from actually flour and a hair
[SPEAKER_03]: straightener.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the first time we tried it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that from, the Gorilla Glue?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember your rosin virginity,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the thing we're going to run into
too, just like any of these other
[SPEAKER_07]: extracts, is that some plants will be
better suited for turpentine extraction.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some plants will be better for BHO.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some plants will be better for rosin.
[SPEAKER_07]: You get to certain heats and tend shit
with certain turpentines and no bueno and
[SPEAKER_07]: certain ones are fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's a matter of where do
these, if it's all going towards oil,
[SPEAKER_07]: then there's five or six ways to make oil,
then that's going to leave different
[SPEAKER_07]: spectrums of which plants get turned in.
[SPEAKER_07]: The GDP, maybe it gets pressed and doesn't
taste like so.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So whatever, or maybe it's like you really
taste better when you get it first.
[SPEAKER_07]: All open possibilities.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the way you think, my friend.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we got to get some GDP and press it
and then blast it and then make bubble out
[SPEAKER_08]: of it and see if we can convince me that I
like that flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you're going to love it.
[SPEAKER_08]: If not, we'll burn it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's best in flour form though.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let's get it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll grow it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll smoke it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_08]: All of us.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're in agreeance with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just call me on over.
[SPEAKER_08]: Call me over.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've been going for a long time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our listeners have probably checked out
around the butthole song.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I hope a lot of people enjoyed that
extra bonus hash talk.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're paying attention, that's your
bonus.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a big shout out to you because
these guys are, I've got some of the hash
[SPEAKER_08]: mad scientists, the forefront hash guys in
the room here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish I would have been more prepared,
but I had no idea these cats were even
[SPEAKER_08]: going to be here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for being on the show you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for sharing the hash wisdom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Turpin' out with me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Chris looks like he's got more stuff
brewing up.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you've got more knowledge you want to
drop on these listeners, bro, I will never
[SPEAKER_08]: stop you.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll put a spotlight on you.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll give you a microphone.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it's time to wrap up the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you guys like to wrap us up with
another song?
[SPEAKER_08]: Would that be possible?
[SPEAKER_06]: Got a topic for us, Jeff?
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's just do some dab talk and some
growing from your heart.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe talk about boobs a little.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: While you guys start the riffing,
I'm going to say thanks everybody for
[SPEAKER_08]: joining me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate everybody for being on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys on Periscope, I'm going to close
the video.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's just leave it on so you guys can
hear the song.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to point it over at this guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can hear a song.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for joining me playing guitar.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fist bump, bro, before you get going.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mental fist bump from across the room.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Follow the Clear Scientist.
[SPEAKER_08]: Made a new friend in Brian tonight.
[SPEAKER_08]: Learned a lot of great shit from me
already.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cannot wait to try the Mother's Milk.
[SPEAKER_08]: Water soluble THC that won't taste like
anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can just cause me all day.
[SPEAKER_08]: I could use an app sometimes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then of course, Jordan, thanks for coming
on the show and singing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anytime.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're my favorite choir boy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got to take what the Lord gave you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate each and every one of you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which Lord is that?
[SPEAKER_06]: The Jewish one.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Jewish one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I wasn't going to go there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll be back.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to let these guys sing a little
song when they wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I will be back to wrap up the show and say
goodbye in the official way.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to set my microphone down and
take a dab and enjoy the song,
[SPEAKER_08]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for having us, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh dude, thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate the hash knowledge.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want you guys back soon.
[SPEAKER_08]: Enjoy the song, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are growing from our hearts.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are growing from our hearts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rusted Jeff, his dreads are as long as I'm
tall.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he takes lots of dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rusted Jeff, he is growing turps for the
green and healthy shop these days.
[SPEAKER_06]: While Cocker Daniel plays guitar,
[SPEAKER_06]: I need a dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need a dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: So big and strong, out of my bong.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jeff wanted me to sing about boobs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are my favorite things.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's about 10 hot titties sitting in
this house.
[SPEAKER_06]: But unfortunately, they won't let me take
off their blouse.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're kind of mean.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they still have nice titties.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got to grow from our hearts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Grow from your hearts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_06]: Grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_06]: Grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_06]: Grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we are growing from our hearts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Smoking dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ripping farts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Growing from our hearts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Growing from our hearts.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to grow from your heart.
