[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and foes, smokers and growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 496 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by my friends at Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular feminized or auto
flower seeds in your garden, I highly
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend Seeds Here Now, and you can find
them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Cherry
Fluff Full Spectrum Extract from our
[SPEAKER_00]: friends at Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of bottlewash and cherry
kush mints.
[SPEAKER_00]: The package describes the flavor as cherry
marshmallow and leather musk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about this concentrate on the
show before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy the buzz and the flavor
from this concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back of the package, it says that
this product does contain 69.84% total THC
[SPEAKER_00]: and non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot
Labs for the delicious Cherry Fluff Full
[SPEAKER_00]: Spectrum Extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, in this episode,
I'm going to read some listener emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to that point of the show,
let's do some shout outs to a few of our
[SPEAKER_00]: friends from Patreon.

[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's turn down that music and
focus a little bit on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not miss an episode, but I feel like
I kind of checked out mentally for a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did have a death in my family that
messed up my rhythm that took me out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the game, but I feel like I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my head back on my shoulders.
[SPEAKER_00]: My life rhythms are back in order.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of great friends and a lot
of great family who supported me through
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big thanks to everybody who supported
me, kept me happy, kept me stoned,
[SPEAKER_00]: kept me smiling, kept me distracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The friends around here, the family around
here, but also the people that reached out
[SPEAKER_00]: on online, the people that sent me emails,
the people that sent me Instagram and
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook messages, the people that sent me
text messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I received all of those messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not reply to all of them because it
was overwhelming, but thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm back on my game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my shit together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get this podcast flowing again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is right on time because episode
number 500 is coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working on some ideas for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been asking you to share ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten a lot of great feedback on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited for episode 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then shortly after episode 500,
I will start the series of episodes where
[SPEAKER_00]: I describe the mix that I use in a
commercial grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will go in thorough detail about my
nutrient mix and how I feed my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will happen shortly after episode
500.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay tuned for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I've got a great episode about
popping and twisting our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also got a great episode about
lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of great stuff coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited to be back in the game and
bring you some quality podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, thank you to everybody who
supported me and kind of let me take a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of a break while I was having a
rough time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also getting excited because the Endo
Expo is coming up really soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Endo Expo in Denver, Colorado,
that is on January 25th and 26th at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver Mart in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saturday is a business to business day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunday is open to the general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need tickets, I suggest you get
them now because the event will sell out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do get tickets, get there early
because there is a long line to get into
[SPEAKER_00]: the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Endo Expo is a wonderful trade
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very large event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of your favorite breeders will be
there with the booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be there at booth 533.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drop by, say hi, shake my hand,
grab a few packs of fresh irie genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to seeing you at the Endo
Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that music just politely faded
itself out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's jump right into the email portion
of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first email in this episode comes from
our friend, The Cannocrat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to The Cannocrat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cannocrat has been supporting the Grow
From Your Heart podcast for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a big supporter of the Dude Grow
Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to The Cannocrat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being a crucial member of
the cannabis and the cannabis podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: His message goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, dude, I just wanted to take a minute
to wish you a happy new year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, happy fucking new year, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for reaching out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I hope 2020 brings you,
your family, and your business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great success, and I have no doubt it
will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy new year to yourself as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope 2020 blesses you, your family,
your business, and your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you said, I have no doubt that
your year will be amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a great fucking dude, and you're
killing it in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving with the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, also, I wanted to extend my
thoughts about your recent loss again,
[SPEAKER_00]: as your uncle seemed like a fun dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these kind messages really keep me
fueled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it helps out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, you told the Metallica
story on one of the very first episodes of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Grow From Your Heart podcast that I
listened to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, this dude's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should keep listening to this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're about to be at 500
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great way to tie everything
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do remember talking about my uncle and
talking about Metallica early on in the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast, because that's influential shit
to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to come up sometimes in a
show or sometimes in conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love that you caught an episode where
I talked about my uncle and I talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: Metallica, and then I did it just again a
couple of episodes ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've been listening for quite a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're right, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are approaching episode 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means four episodes from now will be
number 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually just sent a text message to a
few of your favorites that have been on
[SPEAKER_00]: the show, inviting them to come back and
be on the show for 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a group chat going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get a date together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll sit down and record episode 500,
hopefully by the end of the weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 500 is coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, I am super excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, congrats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being here for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it goes on to say, so 500,
you were asking for some ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I reached out on the podcast and I
said, what do we do for episode 500?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should it be ceremonious or do we just
smoke out and record a normal show just
[SPEAKER_00]: like we normally do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is some feedback from my friend,
the Kanekrat.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, do it live.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, rotating cast, white Mike,
Clint, Jesse, a few hours of dabs,
[SPEAKER_00]: rambles, and general bullshitting about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the only downsides to that is I
believe Jesse is in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse likes to take random vacations down
there in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: He speaks better Spanish than he does
English now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a thing for Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's tacos.
[SPEAKER_00]: He fucking loves tacos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse is half taco at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jesse won't be around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, I did invite white Mike to
episode 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't be episode 500 without white
Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be rude as hell to not invite
white Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel he needs to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did invite Cracker Mike for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I invited Clint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also invited Double Door Dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm waiting to see, let those three guys
kind of lock in a date, get some stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: scheduled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've got two or three other
people I'm going to send a text to once I
[SPEAKER_00]: have a better idea of who is coming and
how many chairs and microphones I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: left.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've got one or two more people that I
do need to invite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to lock in a date and tell
these people this is when it happens
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's how they work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some of your friends,
you let them schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them, you just have to tell them
Tuesday at five and then they'll show up
[SPEAKER_00]: Tuesday at seven thirty, just like you
anticipated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how your stoner friends are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to get my friends,
the crew, the iry army over for the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is hard to schedule that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I can get a few people over and if
I can get them all to agree to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not have any issue with doing some
of the podcast live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may not do the actual podcast portion of
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Live, I may do a pre-show dab session on
Instagram Live would be the easiest way
[SPEAKER_00]: for me to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could just set up the iPad, prop it up
on something across the room so it gets
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole smoking section into the shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we could just do a little dab
session and say what's up to everybody on
[SPEAKER_00]: the live show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we could turn off that and then
actually record the actual podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe do a little bit of a bonus live
party before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll get too stoned after that and
I'll forget to turn off the camera and we
[SPEAKER_00]: may keep rolling and I may record the
entire podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it is not too challenging,
I may piece it into a YouTube video.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, video editing is not my
favorite thing and it is very time
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got a lot going on this month
with the Indo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I make no promises for video,
but I may do a live chat before.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, these dabs got me fucking
rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had plenty of caffeine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked that cherry fluff and I cannot
shut the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is gonna be a longer podcast than I
anticipated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can it crack goes on to say, general
bullshitting about cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says, YouTube on a Saturday
evening or something, just my two cents.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two days I offered everybody to do the
show are the coming Friday and Saturday.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a couple people say Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one person said Saturday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will dial that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do my best to post to social media
and let people know that I am about to go
[SPEAKER_00]: live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he wraps that up and says,
just my two cents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey bro, your two cents is heavy around
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been around for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've proven yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you are capable of rational
thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your two cents goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for reaching out, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on to say, I've had a great run
with iRegenetics in 2019 and will strive
[SPEAKER_00]: to be an even better grower and human in
2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he signed with his real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if he wants his real name out
there, but big thanks, big respect to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannacrat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're on Instagram or Cannabuzz,
I highly recommend you check out an
[SPEAKER_00]: application called Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a shameless plug for Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll wrap that up with a
shameless plug for my buddy, the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannacrat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabuzz is a cannabis friendly social
media application.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot buy, sell or trade cannabis,
but you can post your cannabis related
[SPEAKER_00]: content to Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could post your cannabis weed photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could post your dab videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could post your bong rip videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could post your videos of yourself
smoking a joint and being silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any of those photos that Instagram has
been taking down, Cannabuzz invites you to
[SPEAKER_00]: come post.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabuzz is a free application.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's available for your Android,
it's available for your iPhone,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can even access the application
through the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to join Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once you've joined Cannabuzz,
give me a follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm ire-underscore-genetics on Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once you're all set up on Cannabuzz,
I recommend you follow
[SPEAKER_00]: the-underscore-canna-underscore-crat, the
Cannacrat on Instagram and the Cannacrat
[SPEAKER_00]: on Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been posting some amazing ganja
photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a beautiful grow of the Prophet
growing, and it looks amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can almost smell it through his photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep scratching my phone screen and
holding it up to my face, just wishing I
[SPEAKER_00]: could get some scratch and sniff
smell-o-vision technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, make sure you give the
Cannacrat a big follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants really do look fucking super
good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's keep moving forward
because I am high and rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next email comes from our friend who
calls themselves Dude Dank, and it goes a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Jeff, it's Dude Dank here again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just thought that since you asked for
ideas, since you have episode 500 coming
[SPEAKER_00]: up and the DGC have episode 1000 coming
up, why not collaborate and do an
[SPEAKER_00]: anniversary show together and pull off a
bit of a party?
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that is a cool fucking idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a really good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, just an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thought it might be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, I support and love both shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you for the great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I support and love both shows as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the full DGC crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the Dude, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Scotty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Guru and everybody behind
the scenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there are a lot of folks that make
that show happen that we don't get to see,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we don't talk about a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's give them some love right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big fist bump to all of the folks behind
the scenes at the Dude Grow show that we
[SPEAKER_00]: never get to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do love the idea of doing a
party, kind of an episode, us doing 500
[SPEAKER_00]: and them doing number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1000.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is the Dude Grow's studio
where Scotty is, is about four hours away
[SPEAKER_00]: from my location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Dude is in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we wanted to do something like that,
it would take a lot of planning and a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of internet technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would basically eliminate the
possibility of getting my crew here to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to be on the show as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would need too many computers,
too many cameras, too much equipment,
[SPEAKER_00]: too much preparation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't have any gurus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any warehouse Kiles or any
errands or anybody like that to come do my
[SPEAKER_00]: shit for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Grow From Your Heart podcast is all
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a one man show over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have the technology,
the gear or the crew for that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's a cool idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see it in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be the greatest party ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do actually have a couple of events
that become the Dude Grow's event,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is also a lot of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast listeners, a lot of the Irie
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics crew, the Irie Army is all the
same people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all show up to the same event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those events are thrown by the Dude Grow's
crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the Dude Grow's Cup around 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get together again around 710
and we do the Dude Grow's concentration
[SPEAKER_00]: celebration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got two great events thrown by
the Dude Grow's crew, by the Dude Grow's
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the Dude for the Dude
Grow's Cup and big shout out to Scotty for
[SPEAKER_00]: the Dude Grow's concentration celebration.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at those events, it becomes a big Dude
Grow's crew, Grow From Your Heart podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: crew, Irie Army crew, sort of a gathering
because we're all listening to the same
[SPEAKER_00]: shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all support the same people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all the same community.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are all on the same team and we all
have the same goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a great party, which is coming
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't going to be a plug for the
event, but the Dude Grow's Cup is coming
[SPEAKER_00]: up in April.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned for announcements and details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you listen to the Dude Grow's
show for all of the information on that
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to all my friends at the Dude
Grow's show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, much love and much respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wraps up this message with,
take care, dude, dank, you, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, my friend, Dude Dank from the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all of the support and thank
you for the great suggestions for episode
[SPEAKER_00]: 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have another email right in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no need to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next message comes from my buddy,
Dick Goals, and it goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Merry Christmas, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Merry Christmas back at you, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it goes on to say, thank you for all
of your wisdom, conversation, inspiration,
[SPEAKER_00]: and seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wisdom, conversation, and inspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I guess I do deliver all of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great compliment and thank you
for noticing and pointing that out and
[SPEAKER_00]: complimenting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes on to say, oh, and your work
preserving and improving cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you for noticing, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a huge cluster of great
compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfectly timed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I wouldn't be as
inspired to grow and I certainly wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: be doing as well so early on without the
hours of fantastic content you put out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am delighted to hear that my little work
I've done sitting here and writing and
[SPEAKER_00]: then talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted to hear that that effort has
made your grow experience more enjoyable
[SPEAKER_00]: and more successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those two things may come
together, the enjoyment and success may
[SPEAKER_00]: reflect each other, but it does mean a lot
for me to hear that you feel like you did
[SPEAKER_00]: better because of the little effort I put
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to put a lot of effort out as
well, my friend, so it was a group effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, in an industry quickly
becoming corporate where people
[SPEAKER_00]: increasingly try to hide their knowledge
as trade secret, you put it almost all out
[SPEAKER_00]: there and thus improve the quality of
cannabis for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is kind of my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I learn rather quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learn things that I care about rather
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a very absorbent brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if that's the appropriate
terms for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about how smart I am and I don't
even know the fucking words to use for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I can retain knowledge that I
care about quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, I care a lot about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I care a lot about growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I care a lot about smoking, consuming
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely care a lot about breeding
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have a big passion for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big part of my life and I feel like
it has taken me very far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I am successful in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot of people can actually say they
feel successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm doing what I enjoy doing
and I'm surviving semi-comfortably by
[SPEAKER_00]: doing something that I have passion for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel like I'm working my ass off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work very hard, but since I love it and
have passion for it, I don't feel like I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: slaving away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working for myself and doing something
that I have passion for, it just feels
[SPEAKER_00]: like I'm having the best day every day
when I'm working and I'm doing little air
[SPEAKER_00]: quotes when I say the word working.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is work, but it's not work that a lot
of people have to endure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm very blessed and I hate to
sound cliche right now, but I am very
[SPEAKER_00]: blessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am very grateful for the fact that I
don't have to work for a corporation or
[SPEAKER_00]: that I don't have to have one of those
nine to five jobs that everybody hates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very grateful that I don't have to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like since this plant took me so
far, since I had such great passion for
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant, since I was able to learn so
quickly and there was such a need for this
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge, I feel like it was my duty and
my job to put all of this stuff I learned
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is so much bad advice on the
internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many bad growers offering
what looks like expert advice online,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of that stuff is going to cause
more problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like it was partly my
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a big mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't stop talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a huge passion for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got all this beautiful gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like something came together and
said, you need to put this information out
[SPEAKER_00]: there for everybody to be able to grow the
quality cannabis that you and your friends
[SPEAKER_00]: are producing in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was around the Colorado medical
marijuana market early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was growing in another state before it
was legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't talk too much about that,
but it may have been happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a lot of experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a little bit ahead of the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have been doing it before it was
legal, so I had a little bit of practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as it was legal, all I had to
do is go, look, I know how to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody needed help and needed
guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was more than happy to return that
karma back to the world because I got away
[SPEAKER_00]: with illegal grows in illegal states.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started my cannabis career as a black
market, just a joint seller.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked at a restaurant and I sold joints
to the kitchen crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually I sold eights to the
kitchen crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually I sold a bunch of
quarters to all of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually I was selling quarter
pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, you're just selling a
bunch of pounds and then you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy shit that you don't want to be doing
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now those days are over for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm here in the legal cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like I kind of got away with a
bunch of shit that I may or may not
[SPEAKER_00]: allegedly have done back in the day
involving cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I feel like my karma is to put
this knowledge back out here and help
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody produce top shelf medicine or
recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that's medicine also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel better after I consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means it's probably medicinal in
some sort of way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absolutely therapeutic for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we'll just make up a new term,
therapeutic cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right in the middle between
recreational and medicinal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first dab is medicinal marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: My second dab is medicinal marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: My third one is therapeutic.
[SPEAKER_00]: My fourth one, that's recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm fucking rambly from the
recreational dabs I've been taking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's finish up this email because I got
off way on a tangent there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I hope you have a fantastic
Christmas with your friends and family.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot wait to shake your hand and say
hello at the Endo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dick Goles, I'm excited to meet you,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been talking online for quite a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am very excited to shake your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wraps it up with, thanks again for all
you do for myself and the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't go unnoticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does mean a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wrap it up with best, then they sign
it from Rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's my buddy, Dick Goles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Dick Goles out there
in the world, having to live with the name
[SPEAKER_00]: Dick Goles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was probably fun sometimes,
probably fucking horrible sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Dick, thank you for all the love and
all the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for noticing that I am doing a lot
for the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you have a great Christmas and a
great new year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to shaking your hand at
the Endo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like another great opportunity
for a shameless plug for the Endo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: January 25th and 26th at the Denver Mart
in Denver, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the Endo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: January 25th is business to business day.
[SPEAKER_00]: January 26th is open to the general
public.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do need to get your tickets in
advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I keep saying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The event will sell out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also get there early because the lines do
get long rather quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come find iRegenetics at booth 533.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drop by, shake my hand, take a selfie,
say hello, grab some iRegenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to meeting everybody at the
Endo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to get an email or a tweet or
a text message or an Instagram message
[SPEAKER_00]: from you the day after the Endo Expo
saying, walked by your booth, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You looked busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would have been cool to shake your hand,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come shake my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm there for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you got to wait in line for a
couple of seconds, come say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come shake my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say what's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be your friend also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm 6'5".
[SPEAKER_00]: I got dreads to my fucking knees almost
and I may look a little crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a nice dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be your friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't bite.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, come say hi.
