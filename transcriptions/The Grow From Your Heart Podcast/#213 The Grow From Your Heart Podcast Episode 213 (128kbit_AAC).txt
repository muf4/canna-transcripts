[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode number 213 of the
Grow From Your Heart Podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_01]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_01]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_01]: Roots Band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks to Kat, Ku, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, somebody who has not
been here in a long time is back on the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our good friend, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for swinging by.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said you wanted to come hang out and
take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, well, should if you're
coming, we're going to put a microphone in
[SPEAKER_01]: your face and document this shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds good to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's let's talk about some stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get there, let's introduce Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's across the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: White Mike is joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like you were here just about 24
hours ago doing the same shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give or take.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even that long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just left a midnight left to run
midnight and it's fucking seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost seven ten.
[SPEAKER_01]: So somewhere in this podcast, we will be
taking some seven ten dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a table covered in high grade top
shelf extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some golden goat shatter over
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some lemon Jeffrey high cannabinoid
full spectrum extracts and lemon Jeffrey
[SPEAKER_01]: high terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said terpene.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never said it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: High terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: The high terpene full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevro brought some what was that skunk
berry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some lemon skunk terp sauce.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got some CBD ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some Jack's Jeffrey number two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Geez, I don't need I think it's some live
resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got some sunshine for live resin,
which is Chem four.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sunshine daydream.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going with some flavors right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a flavorful table full.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some what else do we got in
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the the Arise shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some lemon skunk shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some grateful dog floating around
here somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got some orange skunk shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some grateful dog shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of yeah, there's a bunch of
tasty stuff available to dab on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some space bitch shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to my friend, the barefoot
grower and barefoot extracts for keeping
[SPEAKER_01]: me laced up with good shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to my friends at Apothecary for
keeping me laced up with super sweet live
[SPEAKER_01]: resins, ambrosias, full spectrum extracts,
sugars, batters, the fucking full range of
[SPEAKER_01]: the best hash you could smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry if you're not in a legal state.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't mean to brag.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just mean to brag the word.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're spoiled hash brats and we fucking
love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went quiet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone just agreed and nodded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now we're all a little baked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me for the clearing of the throat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just took an amazingly large dab once
again of these high terpene full spectrum
[SPEAKER_01]: extract and it puts you in another place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes you float around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes you a little tingly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoy the way that shit makes me
feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the price point, it's definitely
worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kev started his whole, his welcoming to
the show by saying, let's talk about some
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bro, let's talk about some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where have you been, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where have I been?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had some of my own stuff going on and
kind of dropped out of the scene a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit and started rebuilding and getting
back involved with the cannabis community,
[SPEAKER_02]: the music community, art community.
[SPEAKER_02]: I missed a few things while I was kind of
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of a catch up with all these,
all these new terp sauces and all these
[SPEAKER_02]: HTFSEs and HCFSEs, but it's, it's been a
quick, a quick learning curve back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So started making some dirt for a little
while doing some different soil
[SPEAKER_02]: applications and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Custom, uh, custom soil applications for
different cannabis growers, depending on,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, how they wanted to grow and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do some fresh batch mixes for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to give your company,
your soil company a shout out while you're
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I'm not with the company
anymore, but I still do support their
[SPEAKER_02]: product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, CWC soil is a great place for a
cannabis grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys see what they do for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look up, look them up online.
[SPEAKER_02]: CWC soil, Colorado weed company soil
located here in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, you can get a custom soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: With all your additives or whatever you
need, whether it be hydro, a live mix or a
[SPEAKER_02]: soilless blend.
[SPEAKER_02]: So give them a, give them a shout.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good plug for them, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all love.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything going well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's going great, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some, some cool opportunities
rolling with, uh, some, uh, some new
[SPEAKER_02]: people in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw you think about what you can say
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't say too much at the moment,
but, uh, it's going to be exciting here in
[SPEAKER_01]: the next couple of months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to hearing about it on a
few days.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a night bright uplifting high,
which I haven't gotten out of some dabs in
[SPEAKER_02]: a little while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's real heavy for me lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the sativas tend to be, uh,
just a little, not a sativa enough,
[SPEAKER_02]: I suppose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are, it's a real crisp,
clean uplifting bright high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to make time go very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like time just travels when you smoke this
stuff, you'll start a conversation and be
[SPEAKER_01]: like, Oh shit breaks over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I got to get back to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, whoops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like it could be that for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are my first couple of hits of
the lemon Jeffrey in particular.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, was that the first time you
tried the high cannabinoid full spectrum
[SPEAKER_02]: extracts?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I've had a few of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had a few of the HTF SE's as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it seems like each dispensary has a
little bit different consistency and style
[SPEAKER_02]: of doing, doing it and still having the
same label on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm still kind of trying to find where
it's actually that product or someone's
[SPEAKER_02]: just kind of calling it that cause it's
that, that new thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, still trying to find that,
that, that balance there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, uh, there was a huge difference
in the lemon Jeffrey, the star dog and the
[SPEAKER_01]: mob boss.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the, uh, the high cannabinoid full
spectrum extract just, and they were all
[SPEAKER_01]: from apothecary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every one of them had a, had a huge
difference in consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lemon Jeff's got the largest crystals
I've seen so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that I thought it was really neat when
I busted that open, the mob boss was a
[SPEAKER_01]: little dustier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just looked like real small crystals
and the star dog was sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's stuck to the dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: This stuff will stick to the dabber for
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of that also would,
would contribute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I could be wrong, but, um,
what could contribute to that anyway,
[SPEAKER_02]: is the, uh, the actual structure and
crystal size of the oils themselves on the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about what's coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your, um, your trichomes and things like
that would, would all be kind of different
[SPEAKER_02]: structure and size on the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would make sense for the extract to
kind of show some of that variance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since they're, uh, an extract company,
they're getting material from their grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're probably getting, but they get
material from my grow at three rivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get material from altitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're getting a whole bunch of
different products to run.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to see a lot of different,
uh, textures and different size crystals
[SPEAKER_01]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when they're also different
extract companies running it, they
[SPEAKER_01]: probably have, there's an art.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would assume that at apothecary they
have, I know there are at least two dudes
[SPEAKER_01]: making the high cannabinoid full spectrum
extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure each one of them has their own
little, their one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an art form.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just science.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an art form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure they've got, so I'm sure if
you go to a whole nother facility,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have a way another method.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to come out similar,
but it's going to be art.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like music.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you read the notes off the page,
you and I are going to read the same
[SPEAKER_01]: notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to play it a little bit
differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Entirely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes total sense, especially with,
um, extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's going to have their own little,
it's an art.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call this, they call them extract
artists before anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I'm not sure if I like the high
cannabinoid full spectrum extract,
[SPEAKER_01]: the high turf or, uh, what's the other
shit, the distillate that comes in
[SPEAKER_01]: syringes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure which I like better right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really big toss up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's really just batch and strain
specific for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate, uh, when I'm having a
bad head day, like I've got a head trauma
[SPEAKER_01]: and sometimes there's like just a
vibration in my brain that drives me
crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a big fat dab of distillate will make
that go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so sometimes distillate is my
favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, today I had a slight headache after
lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ate something that was a little too
greasy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ate a burrito from this fucking place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just fucking so delicious,
but it's so greasy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it was all vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, the dab I took after that of the
lemon Jeffrey just took my little headache
[SPEAKER_01]: away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made me, I think it made me forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just so high that I was like,
I don't even have a headache.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what I'm doing anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Jeffrey is doing something really
nice for a body high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's doing something real nice to
all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That urge to just kind of chill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we should go do a project.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that kind of high.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you want to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a good project in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's that kind of motivating
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to clean a garage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen your garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was worth a try.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I'd try to see what you're in
the mood to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to clean my garage either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't feel bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, I did invite these guys over for a
podcast, not just to sit here and
[SPEAKER_01]: bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're, uh, that's already covered on
plenty of other podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I received an email from a listener and
it's quite a long email, but I appreciate
[SPEAKER_01]: these types of emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if they want me to say their
real name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to scroll down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just signed it as Lauren.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess that's fair enough to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said the other person's name on the
episode and I had to delete it and edit
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you guys heard that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, let's read this email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Ross DeGeoff, I wanted to let you
know just how much I value the info I have
[SPEAKER_01]: learned from your growing episodes and how
much I appreciate you working so hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: put that information out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your podcast is my absolute favorite and
I've actually been going back and
[SPEAKER_01]: re-listening to episodes, which I have
never done with any other podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I listen to your podcast all the time,
but especially where I'm working in my
[SPEAKER_01]: veggie garden and in my indoor garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just the start.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're already hearing a whole bunch of
great stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm their favorite podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many great podcasts out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could be listening to Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could be listening to cereal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got so many better options and I'm
your favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's rad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I completely appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been going back and listening to
old episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really cool because I'm actually
reposting old episodes all over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll get to hear them in the feed and
not have to go dig too far because iTunes
[SPEAKER_01]: and Stitcher will only hold 100 episodes
and I've got 213 now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a hundred and thirty and you're
getting skipped on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The good part, I've created a YouTube
channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go to YouTube and search for the
Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now episodes one through 50 are
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a half ass video, but all of the
audio is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hear every bit of it, one through
50.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm working on making all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to catch them all up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll be able to catch all of the
episodes always and forever on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I get them there, it takes a minute
to make the videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use a Mac book.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm using iMovie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm inserting photos and just doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I go, it takes a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bear with me, but I'm going to get them up
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll get to listen to all the old
stuff there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a ton of good grow information in
those episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Around the 50s to 70s, I was really
putting it out with a lot of good,
[SPEAKER_01]: intense, in-depth grow info.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the head injury kind of fucking
slowed that down and I had to get back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now my head's back and now I just work
too damn much to put those episodes
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I write them over time and do episodes
like these to fill in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once I get the long episodes
written, I put them out and people love
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you listen to my podcast all the time,
but especially when working in the veggie
[SPEAKER_01]: garden and in the indoor garden,
that's rad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I give the plants good energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope they like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the email goes on to say, also,
I have some questions for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm currently growing Kanatonic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever had any experience with it,
either consuming or growing it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not had any experience with
Kanatonic that I can recall.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I'm growing Kanadential at Three
Rivers Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets really tall and it smells fucking
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gassy, it's real stanky, it's got
some kush, some earth tones to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoy that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't tell you anything specific
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't stand.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 70 strains and the Kanadential,
if I were to take home 10, I would
[SPEAKER_01]: probably choose the Kanadential as one of
those 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it just smells like gas and I like the
size, but I don't know enough about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys have any experience with
Kanadential?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or no, sorry, Kanatonic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a little bit of experience with
some Kanatonic flower and some egg.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know much about how the plant
grows itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the stuff I had was finished,
harvested, smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Kanatonic I had was kind of gassy like
you were talking about, but with the nice
[SPEAKER_02]: sweet aftertaste that kind of lingered.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's reminiscent of the CBD that tends
to be in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the extract was very CBD heavy as
far as the effect and the flavor I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my experience with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real sappy as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know if you got this from a seed
or from a clone, Lauren.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I would like to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Email me and let me know about that when
you reply to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know if you're running a pack of
seeds and if you're doing a fino hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we'll talk a little bit about that or
if you got it from a clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we'll talk about where you got it and
we'll see if you've got a known cut or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll give us some more stuff to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Around your Kanatonic question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to move on with the email.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, on one of your episodes,
I believe it was called Consumption of
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had Mike and a friend named Doug.
[SPEAKER_01]: You haven't had him on any other episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was wondering if he's still doing
okay or maybe if he just isn't the type to
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoy doing a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really liked his perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: My parents are around his age and
beginning to feel the aches of age pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been mentioning the possibility of
trying cannabis for some of their
[SPEAKER_01]: ailments, but they're a little resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm going to have them listen to
that episode to help them move that
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doug's doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to be too much into Doug's personal
life, Doug's son just got married.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been tied up in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The family's been in town and there were a
lot of cool people in town that haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: been around for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doug's health is pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hung out with Doug twice recently and
his mental health seems better than ever,
[SPEAKER_01]: to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got his head on straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes his medicine fucks him up and
he's doing really well lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Doug is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's just a busy man.
[SPEAKER_01]: My schedule is sporadic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I don't even know when I'm going
to record.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look at the clock and I'm like,
hi, I could record right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin wanted to come hang out today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to hang out with Mike and it's
Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I called these guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like podcast, my house, six o'clock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since Kevin wanted to hang out,
I was like, it's cool to do an episode
[SPEAKER_01]: with about old stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wouldn't bring Kevin back because he
hasn't been on in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought that was neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It worked out perfect, but it's sporadic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to add in with Doug's schedule is
just real tricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Doug's doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's doing really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you call it when your son gets
married?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that change your status?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: If Davey got married, what would you be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have a daughter-in-law.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got one of those now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's a beautiful woman.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a great woman.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's intelligent.
[SPEAKER_01]: She seems to have her shit together and
she's got an adorable little guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've got a great little family
situation happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So congratulations to Zach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, congrats, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, congrats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doug and the whole family.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're great fucking people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that whole family.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all genuine.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all just have a smile to them just in
their walk.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: They seem genuine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Doug's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen him in a long time,
so it's good to hear that he's doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have to get him over.
[SPEAKER_01]: As to the part about your parents
considering cannabis, because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: feeling aches and pains of age real hard
and they're resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: What have they got to lose?
[SPEAKER_01]: They could try cannabis once and see if it
works and they'll know if they love it or
[SPEAKER_01]: hate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they've got a decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't try it, maybe there's
something.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sir, ma'am, if you try it once,
you'll know if you love it or hate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it does work, you may have the
magical cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it doesn't, then you just don't
have to do it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's worth one shitty experience maybe to
find out if you could have relief for the
[SPEAKER_01]: rest of your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even have to worry about a
shitty experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on where you live, I was just
scrolling through my phone and saw another
[SPEAKER_00]: advertisement for a very low dose THC,
but a nice moderate dose CBD edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was like two milligrams and 10
milligrams or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are pretty common in Colorado,
California, Washington, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just go to the store and pick up a
pack, take them over to your parents'
[SPEAKER_00]: house.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to worry about getting two
stone or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not enough THC in the whole pack
to really get high, but there's 10 good
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD doses in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in Colorado anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's more than enough to try out a
product a couple of evenings and see if it
[SPEAKER_00]: helps with the aches and pains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's nothing to worry about that
route.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't interact with medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC can amplify painkillers, but that's
really about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unless they have a job that's going to
drug test them, there's nothing to really
[SPEAKER_01]: be too worried about.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are afraid because of programming,
because of prohibition, because our good
[SPEAKER_01]: president said it was illegal 100 years
ago, and that's how it's been.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be okay if you try a little bit of
THC and a whole lot of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll probably make you feel better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, once ain't going to hurt
you, it may make you feel a whole lot
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if you find relief?
[SPEAKER_01]: What if you're knocking a thing that is
the one thing that's going to make your
[SPEAKER_01]: life better?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting old.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you got to lose?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to live forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy these last years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be my advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Might be a little cynical the way I said
that, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit, you aren't going to live forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel good while you're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy the best you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for sharing that episode,
or at least thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we recorded that specific
episode, was to get some information about
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD and using some of these products to
manage aches and pains specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for helping us achieve its
intended goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let us know if you do talk to your
folks about using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, keep us updated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want some guidance,
maybe we'll, Mike and I, and I'll ask
[SPEAKER_01]: other people and be like, hey,
how would you approach talking to your
[SPEAKER_01]: folks about starting to use some cannabis
as part of your daily regimen to feel
better?
[SPEAKER_00]: All three of the people at this table did
that for a living for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Kevin's old man uses cannabis for
relief.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I have quite the extensive and
versatile history of cannabis use for
[SPEAKER_02]: medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been several people in my family
and myself included that have used it for
[SPEAKER_02]: several different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: My father uses it for chronic pain and now
to treat his cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, it's very wide range with my
experience from chronic pain, various
[SPEAKER_02]: diseases, surgeries, sleep issues,
eating disorders.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it just kind of goes on and on for
me in my experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes stuff that hurts not hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it just makes it just just kind of I
couldn't say it any simpler than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it works on so many different
levels because the endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_00]: is throughout your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: It impacts every system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like a foot rub for the inside of
your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just makes everything just feel like it
is loosened up just a little tiny bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps dull the pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps treat the inflammation that's
causing the pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a miraculous plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It helps your body heal itself.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And handle its own problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think everybody gets that's
awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love the healing properties of this
plant that we we advocate.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more to this email.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to keep moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: This listener and emailer says,
my next question, will you be putting out
[SPEAKER_01]: any golden goat seeds again in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember hearing that you put out around
five thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also remember saying that you
wouldn't do feminized seeds again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any plans to release more?
[SPEAKER_01]: I really want to grow it, but it is
impossible for me to get a clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, do you have any other breeding
projects going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I've heard you talking about
your plans or projects regarding breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find that stuff very interesting as a
beginner grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I figure you're very busy with your job,
podcast and life.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me recap this paragraph and I'll
answer the questions as we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will you be putting out any seeds of
golden goat in the near future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Highly unlikely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most likely that's just a no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not plain golden goat by itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: That takes a lot of work that I don't want
to do right now because I'm working on
[SPEAKER_01]: other stuff, which will be part of a
future answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I do have things like firefly.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, wait, that's lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is there are things that are close
to golden goat available.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got golden goat to a rise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took the golden goat and crossed it to a
rise.
[SPEAKER_01]: A rise is golden goat to daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are phenotypes that come out that
look exactly like golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's available.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure where you can get that,
but send me an email and I will find a
[SPEAKER_01]: distributor that's got it in stock for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else do I need to answer here?
[SPEAKER_01]: You said that I said I won't do feminine
seeds again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not certain of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just I would rather make regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more fun for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like having more males to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I pigeonhole myself making
feminine seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a huge market for it, but I'm not
only breeding for the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm breeding to create specific traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the same time, I'm also breeding to
see what comes out of some of the things
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already done to keep my cubes and
squares happening the way I want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any plans to release more, not just
straight up golden goat, not more feminine
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you said you really want to grow,
but it's impossible to get a clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can get you a golden goat clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to give me warning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not an open invite for
everybody to just fucking show up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're in Colorado, it's legal for
me to give you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't already hear a fucking live for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The doorbell just rang.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the fuck is going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at me funny when I talk about
giving away a sticker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just told people about golden goat
clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get here, you can get one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are several places you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a dispensary right now that has
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you could find it in Colorado if
you spent a couple of hours calling shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but we could figure something out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are we in this email?
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, do you have any other breeding
projects going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny you should ask just a couple of
days ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put about there are 16, 17, 18,
and there are about 20 plus or minus 20
[SPEAKER_01]: females under a light with a Solomon male
in the middle, and they will get hit with
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 7 or 9.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, if anybody wants to get a dab
going, it's almost time for some 710.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a dabber for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll grab this dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only got two dabbers and three people,
but we'll fucking take dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another dabber on that table,
but this will work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll make it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to get this going by 710
anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not surprised.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike will be late.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can be late.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was late today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does anybody have any clue where the fuck
we were in this talk?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, breeding stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solomon was about ready to knock up a
bunch of plants downstairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Solomon is going to knock up some stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some Kalanji Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a Capelton in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Grateful Dog to Arise makes a strain
called Morning Dew, and it smells a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: like the Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're only going to be able to dab one at
a time because this rig's clogged and I
[SPEAKER_01]: can't get the nail off because that
thing's just sealed shut.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been smoked through solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only useful rig at the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more concerned with flaming recording
equipment than I am with dabbing on time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kev can handle this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a torch, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go ahead and take the dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get lined up, and then after that,
I'll take one, and then we'll get Mike a
[SPEAKER_01]: dab going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got those plants in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, there's Capelton.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is Kalanji Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those have never been bred to the Arise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what that's going to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a White Widow in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Hell's OG in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Jeff's OG in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arise to Hell's OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arise to Jeff's OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Hell's OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to think by the rows,
but I get thrown off because I moved some
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff around the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a Platinum Tangi in there that I
think was made by the Garden of Whedon.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a Jack Flag.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a Hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a Chem IV.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a Stardog.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all going to get pollinated by the
King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are all underway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recently made something that I've just
been calling the cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Cookies and Cream Number 13 from
Exotic Genetics, the female that a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people have been using for a lot of great
hash making and breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hit that with the Arise pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just call it the cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes some stinky phenotypes that stay
short.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the bottom branches grow to the same
length, so they all come up to a nice even
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy, and then they make one top that
comes right out of that that sticks up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you cut that tip off, you get this nice
little menorah, this nice fucking even
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy, and you can scrog it out real
beautifully.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a cool one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made Lemon Jeffery to the Arise.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little stretchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little sativa-y.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of support.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of sativa in that,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of stretchy traits in there,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it'll stretch, and it'll go sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got one small one in a flower room
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing what it does underneath a
small light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put it in a smaller pot, and I'm trying
to see if I can keep it compacted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I flowered it earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see if I can force it to stay
smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't top it this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just playing with things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can cap it that way if you want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the way I would have done it,
but we're going to let you slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I wasn't going to do it that way
either, but it's the way it was sitting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sometimes you just got to do what
you got to do when a carb cap's on the
[SPEAKER_01]: table.
[SPEAKER_01]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my most recent breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hit a white widow with a rise pollen,
and I have not grown any of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hit flow with the rise pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't grown any of those seeds,
so there's some stuff that needs to be
[SPEAKER_01]: tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just haven't done it yet, and there's
not enough of them to send them out to get
[SPEAKER_01]: other people to test them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just did one small plant, so that's
what's going on with the breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feel free to any of the stuff that's open
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to dip this golden goat dab into
some of your lemon skunk turps,
[SPEAKER_01]: is what I'm really interested in doing.
Please do.
[SPEAKER_02]: That dab I just took was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see the look on your face.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look like you're swimming and
drowning, and maybe masturbating a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to just give it just a little
mini dunk right there, just put some of
[SPEAKER_01]: that on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to describe the consistency of
those turps last night.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't mention that there's a little
surface tension.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can feel, when you go to push it,
the dab doesn't go through the turps
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to break the surface tension to
get the turps onto the dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could sprinkle a dab in there,
and it would just stay on the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't fall to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am going to take this dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me read something to fire one of you
guys off on a talk here, because let's
[SPEAKER_01]: see.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said, how many plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talked about breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interested as a new grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it when new growers listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I figure you're very busy with your job,
podcast, and personal life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff's totally busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jump in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell them about how busy I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, that's why certain guests are on
more often than not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and Jeff are able to make our schedules
line up a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse is equally or easily as busy as
Jeff, if not more so.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's way busier than I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I take the dab, I'm going to cut in
while I'm just heating, and then as soon
[SPEAKER_01]: as I stop, I'll take the dab, and you can
talk more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to apologize for Jesse not
making it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know why he didn't make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had to transplant a bunch of plants,
and somebody didn't show up for work.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got a late start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse tried to come last week and got
hosed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't his fault, so I'm going to
apologize on his behalf.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry I pumped you guys up saying he
was coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: He apologizes for not making it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of shit happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're ganja growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We work in a commercial facility,
and if shit goes wrong, since we're the
[SPEAKER_01]: managers, we're the ones that pull the
slack, and that's why he didn't make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He pulled the slack and made that shit
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dab's ready, so one, two, three,
somebody talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: They fucking stared at each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: They Mexican standups stared at each
other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was perfect, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you recover from that dab yet,
buddy?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still trying to.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was what I looked for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't going to stare you down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I wonder if he's ready to talk
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was still making dab faces a second
ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was making those dab faces,
it still felt like I was still taking a
[SPEAKER_02]: dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff's dab's so big.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got half a dab randomly inhaling
across the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this stuff is so good, people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're so spoiled here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's kind of ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado's full.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to emphasize that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those lemon turps are stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: His face flashes the flag again.
Stupid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to read and see if this is right
for us, because it does something to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, is this okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was reading the label.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was reading the label myself earlier
this morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: That tastes like I just dabbed Lemon
Pledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the best way, but I OD'd on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I dabbed a little bit too much
Lemon Pledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I falling out of the chair?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it just look like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm okay, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not call 911.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may need a life alert fucking bracelet
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those smell amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, I'll get you a little golden go dab
and then you can just I'll let Kev dunk it
[SPEAKER_01]: into his turps for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can experience what I just did to
my face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike doesn't need big dads, so his dab to
turp ratio is going to be much better than
[SPEAKER_01]: ours was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a good dab for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's perfect.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks insulting if somebody gave me
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the fuck, dude?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I get a dab?
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like the shit I wipe off my
dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the reason when I'm offering people
a dab, I just hand them the hash and a
[SPEAKER_00]: dabber and kind of pray that they don't
send it flying everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm about to do right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's running on my tiny dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep turning it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll heat the nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was a full size dab, we'd be fine
right now, but it's not, so I've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: hamster with this piece of hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're blowing glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: High terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just got to keep it turning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just got to keep it turning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dunked on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells like lemon candies in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's highest giraffe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells so good right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't keep our attention straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: The computer's recording.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in the middle of an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a great fucking podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait to get back to this email and
find out where we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're almost at the bottom of the email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find which way is up again.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is hot as shit, so give it a few
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't dab that yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a carb cap.
Red means go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red means go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would use the other carb cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would use this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one just needs a wipe down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got some kitty fur or something on it
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one that pooped over here
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a little resin came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice little hash cloud comes dropping out
of the carb cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a kitty, so it's weird that
it's got cat fur on it, but I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be okay with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told somebody, one day you're going to
make a whole bunch of cats real happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: She didn't take too kindly to that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get back on this email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, no golden goat seeds for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I love updates on the people you've
had on previously, of course, if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: appropriate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they are okay with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We already talked a lot about Doug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doug, I hope you're okay with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they said, like sloppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quick update on sloppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hashtag free sloppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sloppy's in jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sloppy fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not exactly sure what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure that I should talk too much
about it on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Allegedly pod sloppy is in jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Free sloppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get sloppy out of jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you sloppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: The traveling stoner.
[SPEAKER_01]: The traveling stoner is doing the
traveling stoner shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bobo Blasterco is working at a dispensary
in Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: You asked about the traveling stoner and I
talked about Bobo, but they are one unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're traveling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bobo works at a dispensary in Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They hang out at the glass grind.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do product development meetings with
a lot of medium high and high level
[SPEAKER_01]: products in the cannabis and crossover
cannabis industries and clothing
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: She stays busy as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her website is up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I encourage you to check out the traveling
stoner.com and let her know that Rasta
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff sent you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I was listening to the podcast
and Rasta Jeff said, I should come check
[SPEAKER_01]: this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spencer, Spencer and Maddie are in
Washington running a gigantic,
[SPEAKER_01]: crushing it, crushing it like fucking
Voltron.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what that means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their social media is like one of my
favorite things all week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a gigantic outdoor slash a
greenhouse garden in Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the I-502 tier one and tier two
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grow a large percentage of all the
cannabis sold in their state.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very well respected.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of their pictures are fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Follow, it's probably garden of weed N,
W E E D N on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure where they get deleted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they just remake shit, follow them,
check them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're crushing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're always doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spencer and Maddie are doing well,
not only like social media wise and
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, but they're great people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were here just a few months ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: They visited, we hung out, we took dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spence had a smile on his face to see all
the crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maddie looked fucking beautiful as ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: She knows I think she's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: She looked fucking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had a big smile on her face.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody's doing well in that front.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who else did you say?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dabbing granny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dabbing granny is crazy as always.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had a little cold for a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had some chest congestion going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: She seems to have spit that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: She didn't take a minute, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: She just soldered through it till it went
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like she coughed that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: She doesn't cough and wheeze as much as
she was.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a social butterfly.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a great person.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's doing very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's taking good care of her,
I think it's her husband.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's her husband.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin's her husband.
[SPEAKER_01]: Taking good care of old Kev.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're having a good time, but taking
care of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse, we talked about Jesse a minute ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse's busy as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's managing a facility that is doing
very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: His pictures of his grow are awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't post as much as most people do
because he's too busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not really into the social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's kind of a farm boy and a dope grower,
not an Instagram celebrity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just his style.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse's doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, Kev's back.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I wanted Kev on this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing, Kev?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can speak for yourself on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yup, yup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing good now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got sober.
[SPEAKER_02]: No more alcohol for this guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a really huge change in my life
and it was 100% to the positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I ask how long?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know how many days right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 months and four days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Congrats, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: With zero problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've gone to bars with my friends and been
holding their drinks while they went to
[SPEAKER_02]: the bathroom and whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a long 10 months, ain't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have zero want for alcohol anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some circumstances in my life caused that
to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm unfortunate for those circumstances,
but I'm glad it happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: You notice that we hang out again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: After several months of that and kind of
changing my own attitude and my own
[SPEAKER_02]: demeanor, I noticed that a lot of the
friends that disappeared started just
[SPEAKER_02]: coming back naturally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't having to hit them up and ask for
their friendship or anything like that or
[SPEAKER_02]: wonder why we weren't hanging out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything became a lot clearer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing well and I'm on a great track to
get a whole lot of shit done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was about your age when I quit drinking
permanently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a break and then I went back to it
because my environment changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to a new area.
[SPEAKER_01]: My circumstances were different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was living with my band in a small
apartment and playing with my band every
[SPEAKER_01]: night.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no need for me to not get fucked
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I moved back and then I was like,
oh, I got to chill out on this getting
[SPEAKER_01]: fucked up every night.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't just be out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was drinking and driving and causing
problems and just being destructive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ruined relationships and fucking
probably lives and reputations for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I got sober.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, bro, some people
disappeared when I got shitty drunk,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then other people disappeared when I
got sober as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are like, oh, we're just
drinking friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to be your friend once you're
sober.
[SPEAKER_01]: You act like you're better than me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't really get any of that reaction,
but the people that I've seen who have
[SPEAKER_02]: disappeared because of that are not people
I really want to associate with.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that I'm sober and looking at things
differently, I have no ill will or hatred
[SPEAKER_02]: to say about those people.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just not people I want to hang out
with and be around on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cliff Ravenscraft taught me and I can't
remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was, it doesn't matter,
but it kind of does to me because I like
[SPEAKER_01]: giving credit to people who taught me
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was David Michael Stilsner
possibly, but somebody from a business
[SPEAKER_01]: type, inspirational type podcast taught my
friend Cliff Ravenscraft that you become
[SPEAKER_01]: the sum of the five people you choose to
surround yourself with the most
[SPEAKER_01]: frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about the five people that you bring
to your life, that you bring to your
[SPEAKER_01]: table, that you bring to your circle,
five of those people that you're around.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most frequently you mold your
personality and your lifestyle and your
[SPEAKER_01]: beliefs and whatever you shape to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not coworkers, although my
coworkers and I are such close friends
[SPEAKER_01]: that they kind of do, I would give them,
all of them would get one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: collective five people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that they all get one
influence spot together.
[SPEAKER_01]: My work crew counts as one and then
whoever else you're around kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike definitely has some influence on who
I am and I definitely have influence
[SPEAKER_01]: guaranteed just because we're around each
other so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we choose to because we know that
we're not going to fuck each other over.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to let each other fuck up
too bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to say something.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll let me do a little bit of dumb shit
cause he knows what I like to do and he
[SPEAKER_01]: knows where I like to kind of fuck up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when he gets, he'll let me fuck up
level three.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I go level four or five,
he'd be like, dude, hey, he'll pull the
[SPEAKER_01]: alarm and I'll do the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll call him on level two cause he's a
little walks a tighter ship than I.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be like, bro, you're going level
three.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen you go level three.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you going to do with this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when we'll call each other on if we
need to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen you really fucking do
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really crazy before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's hard to call you on bullshit,
but I would if I ever had the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to go off the rails too often.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we call you white Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause if there's a rule to follow,
you remind us like, guys, you shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_01]: leaving the house with that many pipes in
the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not that you shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just be aware of fucking how many
months you're going to have to sit in
[SPEAKER_00]: county extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you took two instead of three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike and I have always had this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know where I learned it,
but one time Mike blurred it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about the headline.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you do this, bro, think of what the
paper is going to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was something one of my parents was
big on was like, before you do something,
[SPEAKER_00]: just imagine it as a headline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like get drunk and wrap your car out of a
telephone pole.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a fun headline you want to be
associated with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're not going to say,
uh, cannabis advocate who hosts show to
[SPEAKER_01]: help people grow accidentally crashes
vehicle into tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to say fucking stoned pothead
wrecks car kills kittens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the news is not like fluffy shit
doesn't sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got to scare you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you, I mean, you can just think it
down two steps down the road for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like your option is either everyone's
going to know you from a picture taken
[SPEAKER_00]: when you were being booked into jail,
which is arguably the worst minute of your
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like up to that point, I'm sure like a
couple of weeks into shitty jail,
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like basically that's what your mugshot
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're dead, they scroll to your
Facebook and pick the most fucked up
[SPEAKER_00]: picture they can find.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's you forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like just think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that before you do anything,
you guys think about it, look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: headline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those awesome dad are totally going to be
played at your trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, my point was congrats on 10 months
and four days of sobriety, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're proud of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I work a lot, dude, but if you ever
feel like you got a drink to solve some
[SPEAKER_01]: problems, just tape me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll fucking figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that on a nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I said, that whole desire has
kind of, yeah, after a while you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I know how much a delicious,
uh, thick, disgusting dark beer with like
[SPEAKER_01]: an inch of white foam on the top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know how good that would taste,
but I know I can't do it because if I
[SPEAKER_01]: drink one, I'm going to have about 37 of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then who knows what the fuck's going
to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis, cannabis for everybody.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alcohol is poison.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is healing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not judging you if you drink,
but please don't, don't bring it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't share it with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, more on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who else should we give them an update on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who did we skip?
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't ask him.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who else do Mike?
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so high.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the horse's mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so high.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a beautiful young man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's walking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I've seen videos of him fucking
walking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's got a kid that's walking now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should put a lot of Mike's life into
perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a few days ago, this kid stood up and
fucking took off walking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that Mike's life is, is chasing a kid
that shits into a diaper and is trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: destroy everything that doesn't realize
he's trying to destroy everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's just what kids do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, Oh, look at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not accidentally kill yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't kick in until older apparently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it can be kind of high stress
during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Mike, it's getting away and taking
some dabs is a really nice way.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a great teammate and partner
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your wife is fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are lucky that you have each
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so is Davey, not to sound cheesy,
but a lot of relationships these days are
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking very not the way your guys is.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin and I can attest to that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of shit is broken.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys are lucky to have all three of
you under the same roof and giving each
[SPEAKER_01]: other hugs right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, Mike's doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fucking great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm sure you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did we miss anybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure someone will pop up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to know about more people,
just ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we forgot you, you should call and try
to be on more podcasts so we don't forget
[SPEAKER_00]: you next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: This comes Rob from sour seeds is doing
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Adam is doing the same old shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He works at the head shop and rides a
skateboard and smokes and fucking drinks
[SPEAKER_01]: at 40 occasionally and does that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who did the worms?
[SPEAKER_01]: The worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Sean, Sean, Sean, Sean and I mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, do I talk about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sean's got Sean's new father.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, do I say that on a show without his
permission or anything, but Sean's a baby
[SPEAKER_01]: daddy now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, shout out to Sean and Kelly,
Kelly, uh, they, he runs a big grow also.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we don't hear from him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's out at sand salt running that giant
grow out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what, uh, Sean from the worm
organic as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's who you're thinking of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, King Cola Ross Cola Facebook message
just a few weeks ago saying, Hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's up, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, who else has been on the show that we
should talk about?
[SPEAKER_01]: We shouldn't have to dig too deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you want to know about anybody
else, let us know because we're high and
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going blank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's trying to write a note.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause he wants to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can turn off your mic and you can say it
or you could just, he looked at me like,
[SPEAKER_01]: do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your mic's off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think my mic caught that, but,
uh, fuck you think I was trying not to say
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one of, one of our microphones
might've caught that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's who's been, there's only one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, uh, so let's continue on with
the email.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to know about more people,
just send me specifics and we'll let you
[SPEAKER_01]: know a bit more about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we're, we on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took dads and we're high and we were
forgetting stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who sat next to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who was sat here on the show?
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe Buzzy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Joe moved to the East coast and is
consulting and running a large grow out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he's kind of a private dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not even going to say where he is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably shouldn't have said the two
names together like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you're thinking about people have sat
in certain chairs on certain episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing the episode 100 and I think
we've hit everybody that was on that
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Clint's not doing as much comedy
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he's a family man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's getting his shit together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that's what Clint is always,
uh, just trying to be a better dude,
[SPEAKER_01]: a better dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he's all over the social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check him out at tall Clint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Wade's back in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wade was on the show once.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he's a comedian again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't talk to him for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: He moved.
[SPEAKER_01]: He left, uh, and he didn't do any social
media, but now he's back and he's got a
[SPEAKER_01]: comedy show somewhere in town on seven 10,
I believe in Pueblo June 10th,
[SPEAKER_01]: six 10.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have been a lot cooler if it was
seven 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a good way to, uh, just to get a
quick refresher to see who else we might
[SPEAKER_01]: want to mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, because I can just scroll through the
podcast feed and see, this is the long way
[SPEAKER_01]: of doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll just scroll through the feed and see
who's, uh, who's on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently I was listening to the split
podcast the last time I used my,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, my iTunes here or my Apple Apple
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not supposed to say iTunes and
podcasts together anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're supposed to say Apple podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a new thing that Apple's doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what's going on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of creepy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I haven't heard from Tony in a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was on an episode a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a new father.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, everyone's got a lot of shit going
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Jesse Mike, that's Jesse and Mike most
of the time, Jesse and Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems like everybody has been
covered.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, we just rambled for a long time
trying to think about, Oh, Sammy,
[SPEAKER_01]: Sammy's doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Sammy's a parent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sammy's running a big grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see what just happened over
there, but those dudes are fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: throwing stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dabs happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dab and granny.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about her, Mike, Jesse barefoot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will's doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he was in North Carolina, went to go
visit some family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude's getting married.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, congrats to Will and, uh, Rachel and,
uh, their new vehicle.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just put together the coolest,
uh, is it a Bronco, a Blazer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think it's a Bronco.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's old.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an old Bronco.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got that old school flare.
[SPEAKER_01]: He bought one that was beat up and then he
polished it up himself and it looks
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, everything's going well for that kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just paid off a giant debt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So barefoot's having a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things are doing well for that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, cat and coot from the mystic roots
just had a beautiful baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need to talk about too much else.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's enough people.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to know about someone
specific, hit me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably missed somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we missed you, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a lot of fucking people in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just made it weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, uh, the email goes on to say,
I'd love a hoodie or a t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've still got any of those
available, how do I get one?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got both available.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just need to know what size you wear and
then I'll tell you how much they cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let you know all about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most expensive part of the fucking
hoodies is shipping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they're big and I put them in the
priority mailboxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It costs like 17 bucks to ship those
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but I'll give you the hoodie at a
reasonable price since you're a podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: listener and I'll give you a hoodie and a
t-shirt at a very much more reasonable
[SPEAKER_01]: price.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try to stuff them in the same box.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully it fits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may have your size.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure I'd have to go look and look
in the box.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see the box.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's staring at the box like they're
right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should just go look and see if you've
got her size or his size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if I do, but,
uh, let's see more of the email goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I made this email long enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course I'm stoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, so are we took 50 minutes to get
through this email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the entire episode worth of
content.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you go on to say, I just really
appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've donated to your Patreon to show
my support.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know, send me a message and let me
know what your username is on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, maybe I owe you a shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of people have done some things
that I probably should give them some
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, uh, to say thank you like t-shirts
or stickers or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause people have been helping me out and
I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you say I'd prefer you use my email
handle instead of my name.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you for fuck, I did it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll use your email handle, but now I
gotta go back and edit this one also.
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes me think that my, my idea last
time is a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just instead of, Hey, Ross, the Jeff just
in bold letters do or you're allowed to,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you're not allowed to use my name on
the show just to make it easier on poor
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know if I'm using the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to fucking cut out all the
names because it just says use that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it doesn't show another name,
their email handle and their name are the
[SPEAKER_01]: same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not sure, but I'm just going to cut
that out just in case.
So beep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize for using your name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll fix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just put fucking noise over it or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just, I'll record a big burp and just
put that over every time I say someone's
[SPEAKER_01]: name, just fart into the mic and play that
for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's how I feel every time I do
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, thanks for the long email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys don't let me discourage you with
my blatant fuck ups here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me more emails grow from your heart
at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll read your email and I won't say your
name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't bust you out so that everybody
knows you're growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're taking dabs here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not doing rocket surgery.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes we slip up on some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just say a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: With all this stuff on the table is I'm
impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't melt anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were dabbing a minute ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just using the torch with the mics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of open flames and a lot of
flammable, meltable stuff that all
[SPEAKER_00]: survived intact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's remind the listeners that one time I
heated up a nail and passed Mike the rig
[SPEAKER_01]: and a dab and Mike put his mouth on the
microphone like this for her and tried to
[SPEAKER_01]: inhale through the microphone and pressed
the dab onto the nail and wondered why it
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looked at the dab confused and wondering
why it was still vaporizing into the air
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of inhaling through the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, moved my mouth to the left on the
other dick shaped piece and moved his
[SPEAKER_01]: mouth over and started sucking and just
went about it like, that's how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We survived.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll never forget that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're not the only one that's... No,
I'm not the only one that's done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microphone dab happens here.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of great shit has happened at this
table.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave Charlie McMullen a dab to where he
sweated about a bucket of water right
[SPEAKER_01]: where he was sitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You dabbed Jesse out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dabbed Jesse to where he took a nap on
that couch over there.
Jesse greened all the way out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He bad timed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew a Lou Hunt from The Haunted
Windchimes took a little surprise nap on
[SPEAKER_01]: the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was trying to walk outside to get fresh
air and he looked at me and his eyes
[SPEAKER_01]: rolled back in his head and I caught him
and laid him on the floor in the living
[SPEAKER_01]: room.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wade and I carried him out to a chair
outside and he's like, I just need a
[SPEAKER_01]: cigarette was all he kept saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we gave him a cigarette and he was
fucking fine after he lit up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He took two drags off that cigarette and
he turned the right color again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's close to the right color.
[SPEAKER_01]: As he gets his color changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: At one point we did an episode about
edible consumption and dosing and right
[SPEAKER_00]: after somebody emailed you it was like,
fuck bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: The numbers you gave me just ruined... I
think it was the dude's wife.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, wrecked his girlfriend real bad and
made her scared.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I read that, I laughed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt legitimately bad for that person or
that person's wife, but I also laughed
[SPEAKER_00]: really hard because I remember when we
were recording that episode, as soon as
[SPEAKER_00]: you started giving specific numbers,
I was like, oh dude, he's going to ruin
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to ruin some poor dude in
Carolina.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize for that again.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a long time ago and I still feel
bad for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some fun here, but... It's not my
goal is to wreck people.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this table, my goal is to wreck people.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the podcast, my goal is to help people.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you come here, you better fucking be
prepared to get an Uber home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're listening from afar and want to
come here and try some of this stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: just bring a friend and go slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to sesh with people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to smoke with some friends
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go places and sesh out and with new
people that I've known.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a half gram dab in front of people
the other day and then they didn't even
[SPEAKER_01]: want to dab with me after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I'm not going to give you one
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look how little it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, no, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw what you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't even want to dab after just
watching me do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right then.
[SPEAKER_01]: People get scared, but hey, come hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come take some dabs with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to keep up or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just have fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come have fun with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take some dabs in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in Colorado Springs,
Pueblo, there's a lot of cool places we
[SPEAKER_01]: can go take some dabs legally,
safely, congregate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kev, where were you hanging out taking
dabs?
[SPEAKER_01]: You were talking about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the smoke lounges.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yesterday I was up at the dab lounge on
Circle up in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I like that place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that place too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that where Mr. Ben Verbeck hangs out
and manages?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Benley Verbeck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always run into awesome people there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always meet new, awesome people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome people there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great community, great vibe in that
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go play pool and take your dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, it gets very little better than
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Comedy shows going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't wanted to go to a dab lounge in
a long time and that just sold the fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: out of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hung out with Jeff Tate and Emma Arnold
in the dab lounge one day because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: semi-famous comedians.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know comedy, you know Jeff Tate and
Emma Arnold and nobody came to their
[SPEAKER_01]: comedy show.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like 20 people there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're getting some really good names,
some good shows coming through the dab
[SPEAKER_02]: lounge.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody's wanting to hit some comedy
shows, you can usually get pretty good
[SPEAKER_02]: prices in that place and you can go do
dabs and watch comedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to be 21 and up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to not be a dickhead.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch out for people's dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only thing I don't like is
people, they bring their fucking dogs in
[SPEAKER_01]: there and let them roam around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that's legit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to smoke and trying to not
dodge the dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why you gotta bring a dog to a dab lounge?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fucking bunch of hippies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: A bunch of fucking hat pin wearing wooks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the Canna Canyon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Truly a dog fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one cool thing about having
different smoke lounges.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not dissing the dab lounge by any
means.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of these places pay us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go to different places for different
reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dab lounge, he said you can play pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a bar there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a bar, they have TVs there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a sports bar environment in one
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a stage there for comedy or for
bands to play on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got several rooms with different
types of vibes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on how they set it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be one big room or multiple
rooms, but it's loud in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of chaotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of shit going on,
which sometimes I want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did the Veteran Farmers Alliance event
in there and it was chaotic and I had a
[SPEAKER_01]: good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I went for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw the comedy show in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was chaotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I want to kick it and record a
podcast and talk to the three of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Canna Canyon is where you go for the
night.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of couches.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a table.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no TVs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a living room you can stop by.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it that there are no TVs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The music is at a level to where I was
able to record a podcast without saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, can you turn that down just a smidge?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a smidge down already.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just background noise.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could talk over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't have to speak up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Camille is a wonderful decorator.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would assume Camille decorated that
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It screams of Camille.
[SPEAKER_01]: The paint, the colors are natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not white.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not white and orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not red, gold, and green like a Rasta
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a classy contemporary lady
design sort of place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's chill.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like they went to Ikea and got
fresh, clean furniture.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another place on the south side of
Springs that I'm not going to mention by
[SPEAKER_01]: name, but it looks like they got all their
fucking shit at the furniture or at the
[SPEAKER_01]: thrift store.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I go in there, I don't like letting
my shirt touch the couch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep my dreadlocks far, far away from
their furniture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's scuzzy in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only been there twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I went in there to check it out,
once another friend wanted to go and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, here, this is why I don't go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like, oh, this is scuzzy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, yeah, let's fucking bail from
here and go to the Cannon Canyon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on what you're looking for,
there are different places.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the one, there are the two places
together, the lion, and then what's next
[SPEAKER_01]: to the lion?
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that Studio 64?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a totally different place with a
totally different atmosphere and a totally
[SPEAKER_01]: different environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more tighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more compact, but it's got a good
laughter, Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a different vibe than any of the
other places and it's got glass all around
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an old bar, so all the windows you
can see in and out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other places you can't see in and out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the privacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one, the Vape Lounge, the
Speakeasy, the Speakeasy Vape Lounge.
[SPEAKER_01]: That place has pool tables, music,
bars, a dab bar, a band, pool,
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking foosball, video games.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got everything going on in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really cool, but it's too fucking
much for my brain after a few dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just pinball in one corner, pool in
another corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like being in a small arcade and
trying to dab and it just makes you go
[SPEAKER_01]: nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's something for everybody is my
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that there are so many options.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to go be chaotic,
if you want to go talk quietly,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a place we can go do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I was getting at.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys got anything else to say while
we're on a podcast?
[SPEAKER_01]: Since you've got, I won't even say how
many people are listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of people listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recently, we've been in the top 100 on the
lifestyle and culture and the society and
[SPEAKER_01]: culture tabs in Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been in the top 100 several times.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been as high as number 70 and 68 in
a couple of the tabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have not reached in the education tab
yet, but that's a hard one to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people beat us out of that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just to be in the top 100 of anything
on Stitcher is an honor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks to everybody that listens to
Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to everybody that listens on
iTunes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I truly appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I asked if you guys had any shit to say
and then I really interrupted you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll give you the mic for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, man, I think we covered it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming and hanging out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congrats again on sobriety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more fun to do dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't it, dude?
[SPEAKER_01]: You remember the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't wonder where your car is parked.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know where your wallet went.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to chew your arm off and
escape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost never find unexplained bruising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rarely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's going to be the occasional
like, oh yeah, I branded myself with that
[SPEAKER_00]: new nail on accident, but that's rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: My health is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully improved, so all the way around.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's visually noticeable, brother man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's visually noticeable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, you got anything you want to say
while there are a whole bunch of people
[SPEAKER_01]: listening to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the emails coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make good shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally appreciate the emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what else I like is iTunes
ratings and reviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be awesome if you left me a rating
and a review on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go to the iTunes store, search for the
Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right in the middle, it says ratings and
reviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: Click right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then right above that, it says write a
review.
[SPEAKER_01]: Click on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Write a review.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know what you think about the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll read your review on a future episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then click on a star.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one through five.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, everybody has given me a five star
review.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me as many as you feel I deserve.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's hard to say for some reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to say it off the top of my
head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Came out funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: My tongue is getting high today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leave me a review.
