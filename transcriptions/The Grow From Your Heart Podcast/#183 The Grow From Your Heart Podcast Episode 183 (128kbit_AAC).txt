[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for episode number 183 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a source for cannabis news,
education, and conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, if you're a new grower,
if you're a professional grower,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you're a news smoker or a dedicated
dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or
[SPEAKER_03]: even someone who's just curious about the
current state of cannabis, this,
[SPEAKER_03]: my friends, is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_03]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_03]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to Kat, Kood, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ladies and gentlemen, White Mike is
joining me again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's life going, brother?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so busy right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of a challenge getting you
over here and getting a time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our schedules even line up right now,
and it's still a challenge.
[SPEAKER_04]: It lines up and still does not line up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just glad we were able to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good to see you again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to hang out and take some dabs with
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's been a minute, but yeah,
I had a nice little sesh before the show,
[SPEAKER_04]: so yeah, enjoy, folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of sesh before the show,
big shout out to the Barefoot Grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew some cactus cooler flowers,
and I had the Barefoot Grower do the
[SPEAKER_03]: extraction for me, and everybody that has
dabbed this shatter has been like,
[SPEAKER_03]: holy shit, that's delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a little sesh tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lindsay the Traveling Stoner was here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse the throat clearing, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's because of the little sesh we had.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lindsay the Traveling Stoner was here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobo Blaster Co.
[SPEAKER_03]: was here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, Miss Jenny was here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike and I were here dabbing out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody was loving the cactus cooler
shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's super delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all approve.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since we're doing shout outs, let's do a
big shout out to my friend at Handmade
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Handmade Apparel.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys need shirts, hoodies,
hat pins, stickers, if you need any type
[SPEAKER_03]: of custom high quality printing,
I completely recommend and highly endorse
[SPEAKER_03]: my friends at Handmade Apparel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check them out at HandmadeApparel.biz.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike's rocking his Grow Up From Your Heart
podcast hoodie and looking super fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: stylish tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: You staying warm, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: These things are nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike went to smoke outside and he told me
it's 20 degrees outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's ridiculously cold.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a nice little heat wave and it
spoiled ourselves for two days and now
[SPEAKER_04]: it's back to 20.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad I don't smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds miserable out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's not fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So shout out to our friends at Handmade
Apparel.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys make sure you support them.
[SPEAKER_03]: HandmadeApparel.biz.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for keeping me warm and stylish,
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of shout outs, dude, we got a
huge shout out from a podcast called The
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude Grows Show.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Dude Grows Podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody tagged me on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I listened to that podcast anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hadn't quite gotten to that episode,
but somebody on Twitter was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: dude, you should check out The Dude Grows
Show because they give you a huge shout
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they really did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Huge endorsement.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to return the favor.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys make sure you check out The Dude
Grows Show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great podcast about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I endorse it and I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They say good shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't disagree with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So go check them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've liked every episode I've listened to
so far.
[SPEAKER_04]: So definitely endorsement for me as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was funny that they checked
you on being called White Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't give yourself a nickname,
folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was not my own doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I invented calling you White Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're my white guy friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was one of the I was trying to think up
the full story this week when I heard the
[SPEAKER_04]: shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't the first night we went to
record.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just sort of fell out of your head as
something to introduce me as I've always
[SPEAKER_03]: thought of you as like if I'm going to do
if you're in the car and I'm going to do
[SPEAKER_03]: something stupid, you're always the one
that goes, you shouldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You shouldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you're like you're like the white
guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's super white.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a good kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not going to let you break the rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's he's.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you became White Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like my my law friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's not that I won't let you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just I like to remind you exactly
what yes, what I'm getting into before I
[SPEAKER_03]: get myself into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a misdemeanor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I approve.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a felony.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to go stand over here and
act like I don't know you for 12 minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys I'm playing with knobs on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I cleaned up the recording area and
apparently I bumped some knobs somewhere
[SPEAKER_03]: on the recording equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at some points it sounds like shit at
the very beginning there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I've got it dialed in now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I sounded distracted, that was why
I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_04]: That that intro was real clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that you spent the entire time
staring at the readouts, looking for
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever was causing that issue when we
first ran through.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, everything looks good now,
except for the volume.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a volume dip a second ago,
but I think we're we're leveled out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody wants to hear about our fucking
tech issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for listening, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate you for joining me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope we've got everything worked out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just know that we work really hard or Jeff
works really hard to make sure the show
[SPEAKER_04]: sounds good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Mike gives very strong words of
encouragement.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So shout out to our friends at the Dude
Grow Show.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was great hearing that they they enjoy
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was funny hearing them make fun of
White Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: White Mike did not give himself the name.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a comment I've gotten several times
and I always chuckle like you can't give
[SPEAKER_04]: yourself a nickname.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had no say in this happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you meet White Mike, you'll go,
oh, I get that one, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I want to give a shout out to
everybody who listened to the old
[SPEAKER_03]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I posted episode number 180.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's 181.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember how the pattern goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's 182, 181.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got to be 180, too, is actually a
repost of old episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's episodes one through three.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after this episode, I'm going to
post episodes four through six.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as long as I can keep up, you guys,
my schedule is looking ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: I work a lot of hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have my own garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have my own life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I try to keep a lot of podcast stuff
coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as long as I can keep it in my
schedule and keep my life balanced,
[SPEAKER_03]: I plan to put out chunks of large episodes
every week as often as I can keep up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, somebody mentioned that I should put
the old episodes on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was secretly doing that already.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't want to announce it until I had a
lot of them up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Episodes one through 19 are on the old I
Grow Culture YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I have created a brand new Grow
From the Heart podcast YouTube channel
[SPEAKER_03]: that's got two full videos on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I shared the first 19.
[SPEAKER_03]: So episodes one through 21 are available
on YouTube right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: The good thing about YouTube, they don't
limit you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can post as much stuff as you can put
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only problem is it takes me a long
time to make a video.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of OCD and I like my stuff almost
perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it takes me a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are patient with me, I'll try to
catch up every video.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have every video for every podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: It may just be one long, the whole video
just may be the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_03]: podcast logo for the entire thing,
but it will be available on YouTube,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is what people seem to want and what
they're asking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I found ways to bring you the old
content so that you can listen to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I cannot wait to hear your comments,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tweet me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking forward to going back and
listening to the stuff from the very
[SPEAKER_04]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_04]: I vaguely remember being here for it,
but I'm looking forward to hearing it
[SPEAKER_03]: fresh.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't listen to episode number one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just embarrassed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, oh, I was such a poor
podcaster.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I had heart and I was really into it,
but I embarrassed myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I cut people off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I interrupted so much at the beginning and
it always used to bug me.
[SPEAKER_03]: When Conan O'Brien would have guests on,
he would interrupt the shit out of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that bothered me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it bothered me to see myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hear myself doing it in a podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just feel like I've come such a long
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: The shows come a long way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, in every aspect too, from the
equipment pile that we're working with to
[SPEAKER_04]: the format of the show, everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: You couldn't tell today.
[SPEAKER_03]: This equipment is frustrating me,
but I think we're recording a good
[SPEAKER_03]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to get over that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to everybody that listened
to episodes one through three.
[SPEAKER_03]: Continue listening because four through
six are coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't guarantee it'll be three episodes
all the time, but it will be approximately
[SPEAKER_03]: three hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: My recording software doesn't like longer
than three hour files.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really don't think your downloads
are going to be appreciating more than
[SPEAKER_03]: three hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Joe Rogan cuts out at three hours for a
reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somewhere there's a grow from your heart
fan with dial up.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just slamming their face into the
desk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why's it gotta be a three hour file?
[SPEAKER_03]: Their data plan is fucking blowing up.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're mad at me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I can't download this till next
month.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this episode is not going to be one of
those grow episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've been doing recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike is here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to hang out.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is going to be a more casual episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have a couple of topics that we're
going to hit, but this isn't going to be a
[SPEAKER_03]: garden packed episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've done by myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for listening to those.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you're learning a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: The last two or three episodes were
killer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to listen to the show when I'm out
running around.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as soon as, as soon as those episodes
start, I know the feel of it at the
[SPEAKER_04]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, shit, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I get home, I'm going to get a
notebook and just start it fresh and make
[SPEAKER_04]: sure I get the notes down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to all the people that take
notes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love knowing that there are people out
there taking notes packed into such a
[SPEAKER_04]: short amount of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm trying not to, to overwhelm the
listener by doing too many topics,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I'm also trying not to make it useless
to even do a show by only having so much
[SPEAKER_03]: info and my throat burns out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to talk by yourself for like 40
minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Going solid like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The time goes slow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I do want to mention though,
I was, I've been talking a lot about
[SPEAKER_03]: evergreen pyrethrams, a pyrethrum
concentrate, or I'm not sure exactly even
[SPEAKER_03]: how it should be mentioned, but evergreen
pyrethrum, it's like 5% pyrethrum
[SPEAKER_03]: concentrate or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have been using it to battle fungus
gnats.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mixed 10 milliliters per gallon in my
regular feed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I mixed up my nutrients like normal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I just threw 10 mils per gallon
in there, gave it a nice mix, adjusted the
[SPEAKER_03]: pH.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I watered all the plants with
that and I don't see any flying bugs
[SPEAKER_03]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also mixed up nine mils per gallon and
applied it as a foliar spray to all of my
[SPEAKER_03]: vegging plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have not seen a flying insect.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually, right after I sprayed,
I hung up fresh yellow sticky traps and
[SPEAKER_03]: there are not bugs on those fresh yellow
sticky traps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything has gone away.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think the evergreen as a soil drench
and as a spray combo worked very well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I intend to hit it again with the soil
drench in approximately four or five days
[SPEAKER_03]: to make sure any eggs in there disappear
as well.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I was waiting for,
is did it get the eggs?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know so many people who have ranted and
raved about their bug fight success on
[SPEAKER_04]: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday only to
weep on Thursday when it's back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know how to be persistent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I set the product right where I'll see
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's where I'm like, oh yeah, you got to
use that the next time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it will work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I mixed up some push from veg
bloom and some evergreen and sprayed them
[SPEAKER_03]: at the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never thought of spraying multiple
products at one time until I met a guy who
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen him spray four and five or six
different products.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a foliar feed all at one time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen him do, and I'm not saying how I
feel about this, but this is what I've
[SPEAKER_03]: seen him do.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did azimax, he did smite, he did
banish, and he also did a little bit of
[SPEAKER_03]: Grandivo I think he put in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, he didn't do Grandivo.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did evergreen pyrethrum and then he did
push to balance everything out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he just sprays that shit on the plants
and his plants look wonderful and it keeps
[SPEAKER_03]: the pests away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do your research before you start mixing
stuff, folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I was trying to say that I
can't agree or say what I wouldn't do,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I've seen it done and it works well
for this guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the evergreen as a soil drench worked
marvelously from what I can see so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of what I was trying to get at
you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything that works, share it with the
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially since I've been preaching about
it on my own podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, well, I'm going to buy this
and try it because I feel like every time
[SPEAKER_03]: the seasons change here in Colorado and
we're in Pueblo, Colorado, this is kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of...
[SPEAKER_03]: Seasons change every 40 minutes here right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, it's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to take... I could have worn
shorts today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was out running errands.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could have worn shorts, but then in the
evening it was hoodie weather and then
[SPEAKER_03]: tonight everyone's fucking cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 20 degrees outside and tomorrow it's
probably going to be pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somewhere in the high 60s, low 70s
tomorrow, which for us is like super nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a t-shirt, shorts, skate shoes,
hot socks.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: When it hits 63, 64, you start seeing
shorts and flip flops here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when it gets to 70, the skate parks
are filled.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are out on their bikes hustling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just making sure everything's still
going here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have the podcast screen up and
we're still recording.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is successful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's something we have not done in quite
a while and I feel like it is time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to read some iTunes comments.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love reading the iTunes comments.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike is signaling that he wants a fan.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got some hash if you've got a rig in
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I've got all of the above.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a, you get a line, I'll get a poll.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a dabber.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want a dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want a line or a poll.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got the wrong line.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just got weird quickly, quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike's going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as he starts coughing,
I'll turn off his microphone, but I'll
[SPEAKER_03]: leave it on until then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just know that I appreciate your comments
folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love seeing them go up.
[SPEAKER_03]: On iTunes, you guys, if you want to leave
a comment, you can go to iTunes,
[SPEAKER_03]: go to the iTunes store, search for the
Girl From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to scroll to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll see the podcast logo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Click on there, then go to the ratings and
reviews tabs and you can click on how many
[SPEAKER_03]: stars you'd like to give me so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what I'm trying to brag about.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got 44 listeners who have given me
all five star ratings.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you click on the amount of stars that
you feel I deserve and then type in a
[SPEAKER_03]: little review.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the future, I will read your
comment on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm about to do right now from some
folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go in a chronological order.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Turn off Mike's mic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can still hear you coughing through my
mic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you, then everyone will know you're
alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got his arms out like Jesus,
like it's going to help.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike, tell us what you just dabbed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to cough.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was some of the cactus cooler shatter
and all beautiful body high with that dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what the arms were about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you got it together, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Turning you off again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Turning you off again.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to let Mike cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, you guys, we're going to get
serious.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to read a comment.
[SPEAKER_03]: The comment I want to start with,
I need to scroll to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most recent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where was it?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one comes from a listener who calls
themselves JJ olive oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh eight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I feel like I may have read this
comment before, but I'm not certain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to start with this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, Jeff is a very, a very positive
guy with so many informative things to say
[SPEAKER_03]: about growing and the rest of the
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to be a positive dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to stay positive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did an episode called stay positive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to be just an upbeat sort of dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that means a lot to me that you notice
that and you, uh, that you say I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: informative.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, that's a positive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And about growing and the rest of the
industry, I think that bringing my insight
[SPEAKER_03]: to the, of the cannabis industry to you
guys is completely valuable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike is bailing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike is just getting the fuck out of here.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said he'll be back in a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a solo podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Suddenly our next comment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, JJ olive oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for the comment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I completely appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad you find me informative.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next comment comes from Sam S 37.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this one says, thanks Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the comment says, I've learned a ton
from Jeff and the awesome guests.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for sharing your knowledge with the
community and helping make the world a
[SPEAKER_03]: better place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep fighting the good fight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sam, you're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here to fight the good fight.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope I'm rallying a bunch of other
folks to fight the good fight with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I promise I will keep sharing the
knowledge with the community.
[SPEAKER_03]: I promise you that's what I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for the comment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad you're learning from me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike, you're back.
[SPEAKER_04]: You better mostly, mostly better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some beverages will keep me going.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back to the show, brother,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always good to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next comment comes from a person
who calls themselves terpene station.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if that's a play on Terrapin
station.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out if it is super cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, the headline of the comment is
love the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the comment goes like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wish it was longer and or more often.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear that so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to do more.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried really hard to win the lotto this
week, guys, so that we could do this full
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I keep getting these emails from these
Nigerian princes that say they're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: give me millions of dollars, but they
never seem to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I would take so much of that
Nigerian diamond money.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're down to help, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: He also goes on to say they also go on to
say, keep it up, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You do a great job and make working in the
garden that much better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ever think of a live stream or YouTube
channel, the YouTube channel I mentioned
[SPEAKER_03]: earlier that it's coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are videos up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to make more.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can either do more episodes or I could
get them on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a toss up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to try to balance my time that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also live streams.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you can catch me on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you can catch me on Facebook
live.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't do a lot of the Instagram live,
but I do some Periscope and I do some
[SPEAKER_03]: Facebook live stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the only way I really do live
streams.
[SPEAKER_03]: And honestly, I haven't had a ton of time
for that stuff either, but I'm glad you
[SPEAKER_03]: love the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been putting out really long
episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a three hour episode posted.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe that'll help you crush some time
in the garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: You keep listening while you're in the
garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope the plants aren't sick of my voice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for the comment, Terpian Station.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got one last comment.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one says a friend in the garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's from Jubilant Organics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they said, I found this awesome
podcast just a few weeks ago, and I
[SPEAKER_03]: haven't stopped listening since.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like Jeff is a good friend in the
garden now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even controversial topics are explained in
intelligent manners and simply encourage
[SPEAKER_03]: listeners to inform themselves and make
their own decisions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff picks great guests and keeps the tone
personal, allowing for great
[SPEAKER_03]: conversations.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad you enjoy the show every Monday.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I put it out on Mondays.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even when I'm on the episode that's about
to come out, it's still the highlight of
[SPEAKER_04]: my Monday, almost every week.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's sadly awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's sad.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome that I'm the highlight of
your week, but it's sad that I'm the
[SPEAKER_03]: highlight of your week.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not the whole week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Highlight of your Monday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, that's still a little sad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mondays suck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Monday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's why I put the show out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Mondays suck for a lot of people,
but- It's nice to have something good
[SPEAKER_04]: that's unique to Mondays.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least I get to listen to this podcast
and learn a little bit about ganja and
[SPEAKER_03]: hang out with my friend Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jubilant, I'm glad that you feel like you
were friends already, especially since you
[SPEAKER_03]: just found us a few weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you ever have questions, make sure you
send me some messages, because I'd love to
[SPEAKER_03]: answer those questions about your garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if you've ever sent me a
message, but I would love to help you out
[SPEAKER_03]: in the garden if you have any troubles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And dude, thanks for, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, man.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike got a huge shout out on Twitter,
wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I sent you a screenshot of it and said,
shout out to White Mike.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So shout out to everybody that enjoys
White Mike also.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate it, folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to say hi, you can hit me up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's at Nemopunk15 on Twitter,
or you can find me on Facebook at Pueblo
[SPEAKER_04]: for sensible cannabis laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you check them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys support Mike's Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_03]: There he posts a lot of great informative
cannabis stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an easy way to stay up to date on
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank everybody who sent me an
iTunes comment, Jubilant Organics,
[SPEAKER_03]: Terpene Station, Sam S 37 and JJ Olive Oil
08.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for all the comments.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, thanks to everybody who has sent me
a comment.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the past, I've got 44 ratings.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got 37 comments.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody seems satisfied so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Mike, we've been talking for a
whole lot of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think it's time to start talking
about the main topic of our podcast for
[SPEAKER_03]: this evening?
[SPEAKER_03]: We should start inching to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: My head just tried to tangent us real
hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what's on your mind?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you want to tangent about?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just chuckling about the different
levels for each social media.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like just the other day, I heard you
randomly mentioned that one photo you put
[SPEAKER_04]: up had like 500 likes and you were
specifying it in a time frame.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we're talking about iTunes,
totally different platform, very different
[SPEAKER_04]: scale of good versus bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are so many different things on
iTunes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I run two different social media
platforms at home for non-cannabis related
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff in the info that I'm able to see
from my demographics and stuff each week
[SPEAKER_04]: on the two are not relatable.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's something I have to remind
myself of every week.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like 10 here is better than 100 over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you completely weren't joking when you
said that you just wanted to go all
[SPEAKER_03]: tangenty, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that was I was fucking serious.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you said do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I did it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You saw the dab I just took.
[SPEAKER_04]: You saw me turn purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, exactly what I'm doing is
preparing myself a dab because I was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to be where Mike's fucking head is
right now because whatever happened to him
[SPEAKER_04]: looks fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you say you want to go buy some
fireworks tonight, I'll go, sure,
[SPEAKER_04]: let's get the car.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'm just up for anything right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: That dab was delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put me in a great mood.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Will for doing a great job
with this extraction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good work, brother, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, obviously it's working.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This stuff tastes so delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only way I can describe it is there is
pineapple and there's orange, but then
[SPEAKER_03]: there's this like this flavor that sticks
on your face.
[SPEAKER_03]: It won't go away.
[SPEAKER_03]: It like stays on the roof of your mouth
and it leaves like a coating.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a candy coating and you're doing
it right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're making the feeling just licking the
top of your mouth.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just finished a Jolly Rancher and I wish
I had another one that flavor feeling or
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of when you get a little tiny piece
of it stuck in one tooth and you just lick
[SPEAKER_03]: that tooth and you get a hint of the
flavor for like the next half hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, there's a little pineapple here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has such a bold flavor and it tastes
most dabs and most cannabis consumption
[SPEAKER_03]: and smoking leaves my mouth dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like my mouth is juicy after I
smoke these dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like moist and I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not thirsty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: My mouth didn't need hydration after the
dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: My throat did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I roasted myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think all of the listeners heard the
roast.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a long time listener,
you're used to me coughing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even want an analogy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a person that coughs a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Coughing like an old chain smoker.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you know Mike and if you've dabbed
at the table with him, you've seen him
[SPEAKER_03]: turn multiple colors and look at me like,
bro, is that okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Chris, there's a 90% chance you're
listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it wasn't you earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just how I react to dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was like, Oh no, I killed him.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kept trying to say I'm fine,
but I couldn't do what I do just a minute
[SPEAKER_04]: ago on the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't make words.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobo Blastercoat gave him a pretty good
size dab earlier and Mike turned purple
[SPEAKER_03]: and pink and pink and purple and red,
white and blue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun to do the whole Crayola box after
a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole Crayola box.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bro, do you want to step up to the plate
and explain to our listeners the recent
[SPEAKER_03]: news that Dickhead Sean Spicer announced?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, as those, if you're in the cannabis
community, even a little bit, you're
[SPEAKER_04]: already at least mildly aware that the
white house is looking at increased
[SPEAKER_04]: enforcement on recreational marijuana
coast to coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the big announcement from
Thursday's press briefing or one of
[SPEAKER_04]: several.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've got an article specific to that
story pulled up with a couple of good,
[SPEAKER_04]: accurate quotes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, don't tell him that you're lying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I'm dabbing.
[SPEAKER_04]: He knows where it is, but he's too high to
make the keys work just yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause he's doing the rainbow thing that I
just did right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did swimming motions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like trying to swim a little bit
like, Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: He does the colors, just not the coughing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could feel how red I am.
[SPEAKER_04]: You and the Rasta flag behind you match
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my red sleeves on my t-shirt,
but in my defense, Mike, I think you take
[SPEAKER_03]: like a 0.1 dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: My dabs are tiny.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely the tobacco people.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't smoke cigarettes now,
do never start for any reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you do smoke tobacco, just try to
quit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's gross.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're a pretty girl and you smoke
tobacco, just quit even sooner.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a, that's unattractive.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, basically just to kind of lead you
into this, um, this wasn't something that
[SPEAKER_04]: like the white house announced as a new
big policy policy decision.
[SPEAKER_04]: This, uh, this all started because a
reporter from, I believe Arkansas,
[SPEAKER_04]: asked a question that was, and I'm
paraphrasing our state legalized medical
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana last November.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are y'all going to do about that?
[SPEAKER_04]: If anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, so this was not something they came
out and announced.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody asked and he replied.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I didn't even know that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm glad you told me that because none
of the news has really reported that fact.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want you to read the article before I do
my thing on this, but that was what
[SPEAKER_04]: happened and what's been reported in the,
the cognitive dissonance there is why I
[SPEAKER_04]: called you last night and was like,
we need to podcast.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, as soon as I heard this,
I was like, I need to get Mike over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to record.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go look at the graph on
garage man and make sure we're recording
[SPEAKER_03]: correctly because I'm paranoid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure everything's smooth.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we're going to start reading this
article.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do my best not to cough through the
whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to cough because the dab I took
was tremendous.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should not have done that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to dads.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big up to dads.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to syrupy beverages that help
you not cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Caffeine might be my favorite drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this article comes from the cannabis
and the headline is Trump administration
[SPEAKER_03]: puts recreational marijuana in crosshairs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it's written by Alicia Wallace from
the cannabis staff.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're only going to read a portion of the
article and it starts like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: States where recreational marijuana is
legal will be subject to an end quotes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says greater enforcement under the
Trump administration.
[SPEAKER_03]: White house spokesman Sean Spicer said
Thursday, but watchers of a multi-billion
[SPEAKER_03]: dollar weed industry are waiting to see
whether Spicer statements during his daily
[SPEAKER_03]: briefing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually yield a real shift in enforcement
policy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty much the gist of the story.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said that and nothing has happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: No clue has been given.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no raids have been done.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing that happened is Sean
Spicer.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't know who that is,
it's who Melissa McCarthy has been just
[SPEAKER_04]: destroying on Saturday night live.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, he's the mouthpiece for the white
house is what his job boils down to.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think press secretary or something is
his official title.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he just speaks basic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, he's like the white house.
[SPEAKER_04]: If the press could would pester them 24
seven with questions about everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: His job is to hold a meeting every day
where they get to do that for an hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_04]: The people that take this job age so
quickly sit up there and bullshit people
[SPEAKER_03]: for an hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yes and no because I would troll
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've got a team of genius monkeys
working on that as we speak, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: And our next question, I would just troll
the shit out of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why you don't work for the white house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and the whole Babylon thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but, uh, um, he was asked this
question this week and, and what you just
[SPEAKER_04]: read was basically the first part of his
answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, which means nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you, you, you should pull the
video for yourself and watch the whole
[SPEAKER_04]: five or seven minute clip on marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like from 20 minutes to 28 minutes or
something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, um, just punch in, uh,
what was the date yesterday?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you type in Sean Spicer and marijuana,
yeah, Sean Spicer marijuana will come up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was like the 23rd February.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it'll come up where you can watch the
whole video on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a bunch of different links to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and it's worth the watch in its
entirety because there's some other really
[SPEAKER_04]: bizarre political statements he makes
during this particular press briefing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where I am right now in the
article, uh, the statement that he said
[SPEAKER_03]: that bothered most people is there's a big
difference between medical marijuana and
[SPEAKER_03]: recreational marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think when you see something like
the opioid addiction crisis blossoming in
[SPEAKER_03]: so many States around this country,
the last thing we should be doing is
[SPEAKER_03]: encouraging people.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of information in that
sentence.
[SPEAKER_04]: A as far as he's saying right now,
kind of off the top of his head in the
[SPEAKER_04]: response to a question he was just asked
the white house views recreational and
[SPEAKER_04]: medical marijuana is very different
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and two, um, marijuana and the opioid
epidemic that we're suffering coast to
[SPEAKER_04]: coast are somehow related.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that second piece is where the entire
marijuana community was like, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: now, um, the gateway has been debunked a
million times.
[SPEAKER_03]: I consume cannabis every single day to
avoid taking pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are countless people across the
country that share that exact same story.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know somebody who left another state and
they came here to get away from
[SPEAKER_03]: pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_03]: They smoke cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had an addiction.
[SPEAKER_03]: They, they do have a medical problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: That doctor gave them tons of,
this is how it happens to most people,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You get, you get hurt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every day talks to eight of these people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get injured.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doctor gives you pills.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you need those pills.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you're addicted to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: The doctor gets money for giving you those
pills.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doctor keeps giving you pills.
[SPEAKER_03]: You feel good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you take them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You keep fucking taking them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't hurt anymore, but you don't know
that because you love taking these pills.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eventually you're just trying to get more
pills.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause when you don't take them,
your body feels like shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a guy that actually left another
state and is here because he was in that
[SPEAKER_03]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now all he does is smoke cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: He doesn't take any pills.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, I don't hurt.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I hurt the, uh, in our city of
Pueblo, the main doctor that's sort of out
[SPEAKER_04]: publicly fighting the heroin epidemic,
um, going to city council, giving them
[SPEAKER_04]: presentations, asking for funding for this
or that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Program.
[SPEAKER_04]: He started a needle exchange program here.
[SPEAKER_04]: He basically said the first half of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when they said, you know, where this
epidemic wire, why is this happening?
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, you know, for 15 years,
we handed out, um, opiates like they were
[SPEAKER_04]: Tic Tacs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now an infinite number of people are
mildly addicted or severely addicted to
[SPEAKER_04]: prescription painkillers for the last 10
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been kicking people off those pills
and now they're, they're turning to street
[SPEAKER_04]: heroin because they're addicted to opiates
and can't take the opiates they were
[SPEAKER_04]: originally addicted to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now they're overdosing on heroin
because they don't have any idea how to
[SPEAKER_04]: dose it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for the first time in their addiction,
they're buying a drug that doesn't come in
[SPEAKER_04]: specific dosages.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and so we're seeing, uh, overdoses
like we did in the seventies, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: and in Colorado and the rest of the
medical marijuana states, I don't know if
[SPEAKER_04]: the data is back on the rec states yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Opioid overdoses are down here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Compared to places that don't have
liberalized marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's that access to a different pain
medication and a stepping stone drug to
[SPEAKER_04]: get you off of all of the pills that
you're hooked on.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's causing those reductions in deaths.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we have the spokesman for the
white house saying that marijuana use is
[SPEAKER_04]: causing the opioid epidemic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's drastically against the
research.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't directly say that.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just said that we don't need to be
encouraged.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the thing that really caught my ears
about that sentence is it's straight out
[SPEAKER_04]: of the anti pot talking book or talking
point playbook.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see project Sam saying that over and
over and over again.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just reframing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and with Jeff sessions is the AG that
was really our indication, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: or should have been any way that this
administration would at least not be
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis friendly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Jeff sessions is the highest cop in
the country is not a good thing for
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis consumers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, on the upside, they view medical and
recreational marijuana is very different
[SPEAKER_04]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it sounds like if they do something,
we're still going to have medical
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they, if they do decide to act,
they're only going to act on recreational
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there was a really bizarre,
and this piece hasn't been widely
[SPEAKER_04]: reported.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the next reporter asks a question
that's totally unrelated and then pitches
[SPEAKER_04]: in a followup to the marijuana piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Sean Spicer elaborates and says,
um, well, medical marijuana, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a rule and it's called the
Rohrbacher amendment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was, uh, um, a rider to an
appropriations bill in 2014.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I believe that, uh, says the DOJ can't
get funding to go after, um, I can't
[SPEAKER_04]: remember if it's people only, or if it
mentions businesses as well, but in
[SPEAKER_04]: practice it's applied to businesses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, can't go after people, uh,
abiding by state medical marijuana laws,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's medical marijuana specific.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so in places like Colorado,
where we have both a medical and a
[SPEAKER_04]: recreational marijuana system rules,
regulations, they're totally separate.
[SPEAKER_04]: We could see in federal enforcement action
where they threatened to come in and raid
[SPEAKER_04]: all the rec shops.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was part of what our buddy Sean
Spicer said here.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, uh, there is still a federal law
that we need to abide by in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: recreational marijuana and other drugs of
that nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so right now there's no little special
rule that says the DOJ can't get funding
[SPEAKER_04]: to agree with state's recreational
marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a bill right now that's set to go
nowhere in Congress to do just that,
[SPEAKER_04]: to create the same rule, but say
recreational.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and so I'm urging everyone to call
their senators and their house of
[SPEAKER_04]: representative members.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really easy to look who that is up
online.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and just email them and say,
pretty please protect state's rights when
[SPEAKER_04]: it comes to medical and recreational
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, if you Google, um, a couple of the
words I just said, you'll be able to find
[SPEAKER_04]: the specific bill number.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to be extra studious and say,
please support bill blank, blank,
[SPEAKER_04]: blank, blank.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I had that number in front of me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't, um, and, uh, and really do
an effective email, but, uh, please call
[SPEAKER_04]: and push.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause that's how we stop this from
becoming more than something a guy said in
[SPEAKER_04]: a press briefing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, because we don't really know what this
means the press on this like the headline
[SPEAKER_03]: they give you, he didn't know he was going
to be speaking on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he was just kind of talking out of his
ass.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like, well, yes and no,
the, this is a topic that's too big for
[SPEAKER_04]: him and the president and a couple of
other key people whose job it is to field
[SPEAKER_04]: questions regularly.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've definitely talked about it,
at least in a broad general sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and so it's not completely pulled out
of his ass.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really wish it was, um, because it's
sort of in the vein of traditional
[SPEAKER_04]: Republican talking points when it comes to
marijuana legalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's against federal law.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're bad hippie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's the general stance from the
right on this until very, very recently.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but this isn't a specific policy
decision.
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't the white house saying Trump
signed an executive order or has asked
[SPEAKER_04]: Congress to write a law that, um,
or has threatened to, it's just,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, a response to a question.
[SPEAKER_04]: And unfortunately with this
administration, we have no idea what the
[SPEAKER_04]: fuck that might mean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's got a lot of the cannabis,
cannabis industry at the edge of their
[SPEAKER_03]: seat is waiting to see what the move is.
[SPEAKER_04]: The really bad side to what he said was,
um, uh, that's going to be up to the
[SPEAKER_04]: department of justice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what that means is we kind of left
that up to Jeff sessions and we know that
[SPEAKER_04]: he's an anti-marijuana, anti-drug
crusader.
[SPEAKER_03]: People don't smoke marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, there's some much more outlandish
statements regarding marijuana that are
[SPEAKER_04]: attributed to him that I'm sure you'll see
if you Google his name, but, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: the, the good people don't smoke marijuana
is a quote.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's proud of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll stand by that.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's happy to be the top cop in the land
where 36 states are in conflict with
[SPEAKER_04]: federal law.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike, you're not a good person.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I'm a, I'm a terrible person.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get accused of that a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Montell Williams is a bad person.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's, I mean, the crazy thing is,
is there's an estimated 20 million
[SPEAKER_04]: American marijuana consumers and that's
people that smoke pot each year ish that
[SPEAKER_04]: admit it, that admit it, that when the
federal government calls and says,
[SPEAKER_04]: hi, we're the federal government.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd like to talk about your drug use.
[SPEAKER_04]: You go sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then answer yes to I smoke marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's 20 million people, a hundred
million in their lifetime.
[SPEAKER_04]: My guess is the numbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably closer to like 45 million
Americans smoke marijuana a year,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's hard to gauge how many people
answer that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the first thing they teach you
when you start studying research like
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: They asked us that in high school too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like how many drugs have you done?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like zero fucking tripping when
they asked me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and then there's the other group of
people that Mark, I shoot heroin every day
[SPEAKER_04]: when they've never seen cigarettes,
like both groups of people exist.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but just saying there's 20 million of
us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll take the government's low ball
number.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's 4 million NRA members.
[SPEAKER_04]: They get a say in every law that's passed
in this country.
[SPEAKER_04]: They get a say in every single person
that's elected in this country.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's 4 million of those people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I say those people, I'm not
saying I'm not now or haven't been a NRA
[SPEAKER_04]: member in the past.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew up in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a very conservative parent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but there's only 4 million of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not very many people.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's less than the number of people that
are in Colorado period.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado doesn't get a say in who's
elected Senator in New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's a very small number of people
and there's two reasons they have power.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because their members regularly send
10, 20, $30 a year to the NRA and their
[SPEAKER_04]: members vote.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's fucking it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't have any other magical powers.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't have a magic genie that helps
them achieve their goals.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have 4 million people that contribute
a small amount of money individually each
[SPEAKER_04]: year and they all vote.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if the government's low ball number
is 20 million American pot smokers,
[SPEAKER_04]: why are we the butt of every joke when it
comes to politics?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is marijuana still illegal in most
States?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is it still illegal federally?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we won't contribute small amounts
of money individually to places like the
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana policy project that actually
fight for legalization nationally.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we don't vote or when we do vote,
we don't vote unified.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we should all vote.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the obvious part.
[SPEAKER_03]: If, uh, so you said the marijuana policy,
say it again, the marijuana policy
[SPEAKER_03]: project, marijuana policy project.
[SPEAKER_03]: If, if you had to choose one organization
other than the grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_03]: podcast to send funds to, to support the
legalization of cannabis, where would you
[SPEAKER_03]: recommend?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a couple.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you actually want to contribute
financially, you should take more than
[SPEAKER_04]: listening to this podcast or whatever I
say to figure out who you want to donate
[SPEAKER_04]: to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so I'm not even going to throw out a
name.
[SPEAKER_04]: I threw out marijuana policy project off
the cuff, just cause they do a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: policy work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but so should they start locally or
should they go with the big national
[SPEAKER_03]: group?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it depends where you're at and what
your situation is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you live in a full prohibition state,
by all means start locally.
[SPEAKER_03]: So throw some fuel at the fire on your
side, put some, put some ammo in the,
[SPEAKER_03]: in the gun there by putting some financial
contributions into your side of the
[SPEAKER_03]: battle.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only time marijuana consumers get
together is, uh, is, is to get baked.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we would just do it a little bit
for like three years in a row,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's all it would take.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all it would take.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, I know it's never going to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just four years in a row.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not hopeful.
[SPEAKER_03]: A whole Trump presidency.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, see, that's the thing that year
one's already over and it's only February.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's scary to say it, but like,
that's how politics works.
[SPEAKER_04]: True.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're behind the, because the last year is
all campaign.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and honestly, there's like 47 things
on his agenda.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to deploy all the illegals.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to build the wall.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you mean like two years, I have to
watch all those stupid commercials again.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna be like two and a half years,
huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Worse in about four months, local election
ad start.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but they're not nearly as bad as the
presidential ads on TV.
[SPEAKER_04]: They get away with saying crazy or shit,
but they're not nearly as frequent as the
[SPEAKER_04]: national ads.
[SPEAKER_03]: And our local ads are kind of funny
because I know the people and it's funny
[SPEAKER_03]: to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: It amuses me.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, Oh, I even lost my little rant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just get involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find out who you can contribute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be too financially.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're in the position, do it,
go the amount of shit Trump's got slated
[SPEAKER_04]: for already just the stuff that he's kind
of thrown together is this is seriously in
[SPEAKER_04]: the works.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're working on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're actually issuing directives and
memorandums telling people to work on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That list of shit is already four years
deep.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you add in campaigning for
reelection, midterm elections and the work
[SPEAKER_04]: he has to do out on the stump saying I'm
your president vote for this guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we don't really have time to go get
all the stoners.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the other thing I wanted to,
to really emphasize while we're talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about this, before we move on is that all
of the press around this was scary
[SPEAKER_04]: sounding.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you watch the video and understand
what's actually happening in the moment,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is something you've been waiting for
to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not scary.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's expected.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and the there's good news in it too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so don't freak out yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other good news is that no,
no one's going to be in jail in the next
[SPEAKER_04]: year or two because they work in the
marijuana industry legally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's only been semi-illegal anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always been federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've always been kind of just pushing
the button and pressing our luck.
[SPEAKER_04]: This, the, I mean, the legitimate threat
of, of jail time is there, but the reality
[SPEAKER_04]: is that it's a numbers game.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something like five or 6,000 DEA
agents total.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something like 25,000 Colorado
marijuana, legal marijuana employees.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, something like 3000 legal marijuana
businesses across the state.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, almost a thousand storefronts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you just do the math.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, okay, two DEA agents,
two, two businesses a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's just not workable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you add in that there's eight
states that are wrecked now, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: it, it becomes completely undoable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so any sort of action from the white
house on this will be, um, and it'll start
[SPEAKER_04]: off with, we're officially going to take
an action though.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll come out and announce that coming
up, they're going to do something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then in a couple of weeks,
they'll announce what they're doing is
[SPEAKER_04]: most likely sending, um, the eight states
that have gone recreational.
[SPEAKER_04]: If that's all they choose to target,
um, that, uh, they're going to threaten
[SPEAKER_04]: some sort of major federal funding piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they continue to issue licenses,
we're going to take away all your highway
[SPEAKER_03]: funding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what they did with the drinking
age when they wanted to raise it to 21
[SPEAKER_04]: coast to coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there were a number of states that
were like, how fuck you states rights.
[SPEAKER_04]: The feds were like, yo, you're totally
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck without roads.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was the only threat they had to
make.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't even have to put it in writing
bullshit, tough love.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and that's the reality of how states
get their funding right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: If uncle Sam may happy with you,
your state starts to death in a year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so it won't take much to, to,
to really dismantle the industry coast to
[SPEAKER_04]: coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: If that's what they choose to do,
but they're not going to do it with,
[SPEAKER_04]: with big guns and vests that won't show up
for two years down the road until the last
[SPEAKER_04]: nine shops that won't shut down with
threat letters.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, love is just still out there slinging
eights for fucking 70 bucks until there's
[SPEAKER_04]: just one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it gets freaky, but this will be
a slow long process.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like it was building up to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You remember when you had one store and
then you had eight stores and then you had
[SPEAKER_04]: 37 stores.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when we were the only store in
the city of Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was an hour and 40 minute drive to the
next one.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a, there was that one spot in
Pueblo West, but they had like a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know another one that's still there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't even say their name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't let me tangent that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to take a turn here.
[SPEAKER_03]: People, uh, excuse my coughs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took a giant dab while Mike was ranting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything feels good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just had to cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we've been talking a lot about
politics and this Sean Spicer and his
[SPEAKER_03]: bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we're going to talk about something a
little bit different now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to lighten up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to talk about cannabis,
cannabis consumption.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so before I had this cactus cooler
hash, I had our friend, uh, the barefoot
[SPEAKER_03]: grower make some other hash out of some
flowers that I had.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was some cascade and I had a nice
portion of cascade shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I dabbed on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit for, Oh, a good month.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, like I had, I had a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I dabbed on it for like a solid month.
[SPEAKER_03]: All my friends at work loved it because I
would dab on my breaks with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Occasionally when I could like,
bro, can get a dab of this and he'd be
[SPEAKER_03]: like, Holy shit, that ruins me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was loving it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I noticed that when I would smoke
with some people, they would get so high
[SPEAKER_03]: from it and I could take giant dabs and
I'd just be like, that was delicious,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I don't really get super high from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a couple of days ago I was
getting low and I knew that the time from
[SPEAKER_03]: my new batch of hash to where my old batch
of hash, there might be an overlap to
[SPEAKER_03]: where I would run out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got some hash from a dispensary and
it wasn't like super quality hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't bad hash, but it wasn't like
really expensive, fancy hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just middle of the mall hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, it was quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, I worked for living hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got so fucking high off that hash,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: One normal size dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the time I blew it out, I felt my eyes
get that bloodshot tinge to it and my face
[SPEAKER_03]: went a little fuzzy and my brain started
dancing in my head like, Oh, there it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been missing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I really think, uh, that some,
that a phenomenon happens with me and
[SPEAKER_03]: probably with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I've heard many, many, many people
talk about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I call it strain lock is the name I've
assigned it.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it fully has a slag.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called strain lock.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard many people refer to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you agree that if you smoke the same
strain day after day after day,
[SPEAKER_04]: I do it to myself with flowers all the
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long does it take you with flowers to
make that happens?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it depends how much I'm consuming
and how fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I can smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did an outdoor blueberry at one point
and I remember watching it happen and
[SPEAKER_04]: knowing it was happening and I couldn't do
anything to stop it because of just how
[SPEAKER_04]: things were financially at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I had, um, like three nice quarter
pound bags, this blueberry that I
[SPEAKER_04]: harvested and the first bag went real
slow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was taking, taking nugs out of that bag
for like, two, three months, just smoking
[SPEAKER_04]: like crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was week outdoor that I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember the batch.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that batch very well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, the first bag went real slow in
the second bag, you know, it went a little
[SPEAKER_04]: faster, but not noticeably.
[SPEAKER_04]: The third bag was gone in like a week,
just smoking through it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I, I couldn't get baked anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I would get, you know, any sort of
like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I really need five minutes away.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to go smoke, smoke a joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that would go away.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the, oh, I'm baked would never kick
in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were just getting the medicine and
not, not enough to push your brain into
[SPEAKER_03]: that zone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had, I grew two plants that run and
the other one came out terribly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just, it got like two weeks before it
was done and it just decided it was done
[SPEAKER_04]: and laid over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I didn't know what I was doing at
the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just harvested it real quick and had
a friend blast it and it took them a while
[SPEAKER_04]: to get around to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause they took one look at the material
and were like, Oh, this is something
[SPEAKER_04]: somebody fucked up badly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes at the back of the line and it
stays there until there isn't a line and
[SPEAKER_04]: then it gets to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and when I finally got it back,
I was almost out of that blueberry in the
[SPEAKER_04]: first dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I was just like giggle baked for
like two solid hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember thinking it's had,
it's the strain lock.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been on that blueberry for so long.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I just did it to myself a little bit
with the, the last ounce I picked up,
[SPEAKER_04]: it was all I picked up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but I've been spacing plenty of my
vintage hash in and out of it to keep that
[SPEAKER_04]: from happening too badly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I smoked so much of that
cascade shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I became immune to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: My body was like, yeah, good job.
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I shopped to avoid it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, a buddy of mine, Dave, we used to get
it real bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, way back in the day when it was a
hundred dollar quarters, $400 ounces
[SPEAKER_04]: period for everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's one guy in the neighborhood
growing the same strain all the time,
[SPEAKER_03]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you just go to that one guy and get
that same strain every time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And eventually you're like, bro,
I hate to say it, but grow something
[SPEAKER_03]: different.
[SPEAKER_04]: We would wait for our paydays to line up
so that we could go to two guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we would actively like,
no, bro, we just smoked a bowl of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to smoke a bowl of the other just
to kind of even it out, just to keep this
[SPEAKER_04]: from happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause those dry spells back then where it
was like, Oh, really only the blue grapes
[SPEAKER_04]: again, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've smoked myself to a point to where if
I smoke too early in the morning,
[SPEAKER_03]: like I go to work early.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys like I'm going to work before the
sun's up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's dark when I drive to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I smoke before I go to work,
by the time I'm off work, like,
[SPEAKER_03]: cause or, or later in the night,
we'll see, we'll just, we'll take work out
[SPEAKER_03]: of the equation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll take any fucking function and
driving out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just make this innocent on Saturday
on my day off on Saturday.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I wake up and take a dab at nine and
take a dab at 10 and take a dab at 11 by
[SPEAKER_03]: like five or six o'clock, I'm taking a
half gram dads and I'm just chasing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I can't even get high properly as to
where that's where I've dabbed myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I felt myself getting there and then I had
to take a trip and I was gone for 10 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I got back, it was like,
I was in high school again.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I was going to say is take a
break.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you get to that point, just flush out
the system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't smoke for, try not to smoke for one
whole day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when you do smoke that next day,
you'd be like, Holy shit, that was worth
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I went from like daily heavy
consumption for like several years to no
[SPEAKER_04]: consumption almost just a tiny,
tiny, tiny, tiny amount of consumption for
[SPEAKER_04]: 10 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and when I came back, I hit the bong
that I had left, um, like a half smoked
[SPEAKER_04]: bowl.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just kind of looked at it and was
like, Oh, well, like I didn't really want
[SPEAKER_04]: to roast half a bowl that's already burned
and been sitting here for 10 days from my
[SPEAKER_04]: first weed back, but waste not want not.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hit it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember sitting the bong down and
looking around my basement, being like,
[SPEAKER_04]: where am I for a minute?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm baked in about five minutes later.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to get up and walk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Walk down the hall and lay down in bed for
20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the first time that had
happened in like a decade.
[SPEAKER_04]: At least a little tolerance break will
reset you quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you ever go through phases to where
you can just smoke and smoke and smoke and
[SPEAKER_03]: nothing happens, but then you have other
phases to where you can just look at your
[SPEAKER_03]: bag of weed and you're like, got them high
for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was micro dosing with edibles all day
long.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, just managing a couple of different
injuries that I had, um, I was taking THC
[SPEAKER_04]: and CBD all day long.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was playing with the looking for the
sweet spot dose.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so some days it was, um, we're so
spoiled here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm taking sativa tablets in the morning
and indica tablets in the afternoon and,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, half THC half CBD tablets spaced out
all day through.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would screw up the dosing from time
to time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember like getting home,
taking two bong hits, getting up and being
[SPEAKER_04]: like, Oh, Oh, I was shooting for a four
cause I got shit I need to do today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to six and headed to an eight.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I'm going to do now is go make a
sandwich.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to sit somewhere and eat it
quietly for 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll reassess, um, laundry
happening today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to make it to Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to push through those.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I get that, Oh no, this high,
this dab has got me just too high.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when I try to like just,
you got to get up when you feel it coming
[SPEAKER_03]: on.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you got a break, you got to get up
and get out the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like a timeframe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I don't hit that timeframe,
I become part of the couch or I become
[SPEAKER_03]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just do, do, do, do on Insta.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just got to get up and leave.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I'll just get up and leave the
house just to have gotten up and left the
[SPEAKER_03]: house.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, uh, I've got a hash at the house right
now and the high, the only way I can
[SPEAKER_04]: describe it is everything's an interesting
video game.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so like you can sit there and do 30
bottles through the sink and then,
[SPEAKER_04]: or pull them out of the dishwasher and
reassemble it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's super entertaining.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with a good podcast or some,
some Pandora on in the background,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll lose half a day like that with the
right hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just zipping around and enjoying the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting stuff done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bro, we've been going for almost an hour
and I feel like we should start wrapping
[SPEAKER_03]: up the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else you want to say about
Dickhead Sean Spicer or, uh, talk about
[SPEAKER_03]: strain lock?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you can mention Jeff Sessions if you
want, since for some reason his name
[SPEAKER_03]: almost came out of my face.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just, uh, I mean, this is some,
this is a drum I've been beaten for a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and honestly what, what I've seen
personally, especially after this most
[SPEAKER_04]: recent election, um, I mean, we went,
we, from having our jobs, maybe,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, getting voted away to a success coast
to coast for marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so for election night was a big win
for a lot of us.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm super liberal listeners.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you hadn't figured that out yet,
sorry to shock you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and so I was, I was really bummed
about president Trump, but I also wasn't
[SPEAKER_04]: excited about Hillary Clinton as a
candidate just to throw that out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, it wasn't that big and marijuana
one huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was enough of a note for me to,
to really take kind of a positive outlook
[SPEAKER_04]: from the election.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I saw from the marijuana
community here in Pueblo was relief,
[SPEAKER_04]: excitement, and then I got to be fucking
work on Monday.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was so nice to just have our lives
again, where you just had your
[SPEAKER_04]: responsibilities and you didn't have this
annoying threat looming over you,
[SPEAKER_04]: where there's this group of morons looking
to take our jobs away because they can't
[SPEAKER_04]: stand driving past green crosses on their
way to church.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, all of that went away and we could
just be us again for a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where we could get up and go to work and
pay our bills and go to bed and make
[SPEAKER_04]: dinners and, and just live for a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we took our eye off the ball.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we definitely did the same thing after
we legalized recreational recreational
[SPEAKER_04]: legalization happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all focused on getting a shop up,
getting a grow up, getting a job in the
[SPEAKER_04]: industry, keeping a job in the industry,
uh, innovating in the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we took our eye off the ball with
regulations and now we've got some really
[SPEAKER_04]: weird fucking rules in Colorado because
the anti-pop people didn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and if we don't kind of focus up and
more people don't get active soon,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, we're in trouble.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, politics swings back and forth,
like a pendulum.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, if you look back over history and it
gets clear, the further back in history
[SPEAKER_04]: you go, things go liberal, conservative,
liberal, conservative, liberal,
[SPEAKER_04]: conservative about every 10 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: The last eight years weren't conservative
at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next 10 years look to be like they
might be.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's not great news for the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we revert back to the one trait that
we've all got in common, it's kept us
[SPEAKER_04]: alive as a community this long.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like we hide well, we blend well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, if we have to, we disappear and you
can't see us at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we look like everybody else,
but smoke a lot of weed at night inside.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and that kept us alive for decades and
it's going to kill us right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make yourselves known.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just, I mean, just take a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're like, you know, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like voting is dumb.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't count.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need to pay attention to this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody else is on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just take a minute and think about $400
ounces again for everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about every now and again,
running into Maxi brick and taking a few
[SPEAKER_04]: minutes and being like, maybe it's a way I
can save 60 bucks this month.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember what those days were like,
and ask yourself if you want to go back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody wants to go back to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: No one I know that's made the transfer
into the legal industry wants anything to
[SPEAKER_04]: do with any part of what they had to deal
with back in the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: It, with the small exception of that kind
of profit margin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that was the only thing that made
anybody any, anything out of that old
[SPEAKER_04]: system.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was too much profit to the wrong
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it had to be that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it could be that way because it was
illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason the price of an ounce over
my adult life has gone from 400 an ounce
[SPEAKER_04]: for mediocre weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you were super happy to buy it to a
hundred and ounce, 150 an ounce,
[SPEAKER_04]: 200 an ounce.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't really want those $100 ounces.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw a place pitching $50.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a promo on, on social media,
$50 ounces out the door.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know what the tax rate is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, how much of that is shoe
leather?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like good Lord.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just trim, just untrimmed funky buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just what else could it possibly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see good ounces out there for like 135,
150 in that region.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're willing to hunt, you can find a
really solid ounce for, for a little under
[SPEAKER_04]: 150.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most places for, for something that you're
going to be super psyched about.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm usually paying about 200 if I'm going
to a rec shop with a decent menu price.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which isn't bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not bad at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: And honestly, I spent so long paying 400
an ounce and being happy about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mind paying 200 an ounce,
250 an ounce if I have to.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't feel so bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that if it ever comes to it,
I can go get four ounce for 200 bucks in
[SPEAKER_04]: hell if I need to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it comes with a lab test attached to
the package.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get all the spider mines and white
flies you could ever want.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, there were so many things that
are amazing about what we've done in
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado over the last few years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm just looking at the table and
I'm like, email, emails wouldn't be a
[SPEAKER_04]: thing if, if Colorado wouldn't have done
what we did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that the hash we've done on this
table wouldn't be around yet if Colorado
[SPEAKER_04]: hadn't done what we did.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not at all looking forward to what
the market might be like if people are
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to recreate what we've got now in
basements.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basements produce a lot of amazing flour.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when it comes to the hash rule,
you guys are just fucking hurting the
[SPEAKER_04]: industry trying to make that shit at home.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Leave that to the lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Leave that to the professionals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't blow up your basement making
hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't really hit it all during this
because I was trying to stay at least a
[SPEAKER_04]: little positive.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we don't need any black eyes right now
as a community.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time somebody gets high and drives
through a fence or over, over some
[SPEAKER_04]: pedestrian or blows up their fucking
apartment making hash, we all take two
[SPEAKER_04]: steps back.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the people that really want to see
nationwide raids, because that's what the
[SPEAKER_04]: anti-pop people are calling for.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're calling for nationwide raids.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're calling for 35,000 arrests because
there were two other really scary moves
[SPEAKER_04]: nationally this week.
[SPEAKER_04]: One, we rescinded the move away from
private prisons that went in last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all the private prisons don't have to
worry about getting shut down and
[SPEAKER_04]: transferred back into state ownership.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to need people to keep them
full.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't even remember what the fuck
the other one was.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was another one that tied into those
three that does not look good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, they're going to need people.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to need to make arrests.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the anti-pop folks around the country,
they've still stayed together.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've kept their eye on the ball since
the election.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been super excited to see
President Trump pick Jeff Sessions to be
[SPEAKER_04]: our attorney general.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's been kind of fun watching the
anti-pop people bicker about politics
[SPEAKER_04]: because some of them are liberal and some
of them are conservative.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing they agree on is they hate
pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the only people that they can interact
with on social media are other people that
[SPEAKER_04]: hate pot or think he called crazy a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they've been kind of in a war about
President Trump and they're all super
[SPEAKER_04]: excited about him now because he picked
Jeff Sessions who will go after marijuana
[SPEAKER_04]: for sure because that's sort of been his
thing his whole life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now this announcement or this response
from Sean Spicer, like they're getting
[SPEAKER_04]: what they want.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're speaking up.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're writing people.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're writing their representatives.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're making phone calls.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what elected representatives
listen to is how many people annoy them
[SPEAKER_04]: with phone calls and emails every week.
[SPEAKER_03]: You hear that guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to annoy people with phone calls.
[SPEAKER_03]: Annoy the right people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let them know that you do not want to lose
your recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sharing stuff on Facebook helps inform
people you're friends with that read
[SPEAKER_04]: things that they see on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: Share real stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can share real stuff, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what really matters right now,
what really actually does have an impact
[SPEAKER_04]: is making phone calls and sending emails
to the right people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reality is that marijuana is way
more popular than President Trump.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look at the election results,
he's like 52.1.
[SPEAKER_04]: Marijuana is a 61.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's coast to coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Pueblo, Trump won.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're traditionally a democratic area.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was a huge win for the Republicans.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure people just didn't go vote.
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of it's the Democrats didn't go vote
for a number of different reasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, politics swings.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've never had a two term president from
one party followed by a president from the
[SPEAKER_04]: same party.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's never happened ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone who knows anything about politics
knew that whatever fucking ass clown the
[SPEAKER_04]: GOP threw up in front of the fucking
ticket was going to be our next president.
[SPEAKER_04]: They could have picked anyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: They did.
[SPEAKER_04]: They did.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just picked any fucking monkey they
could find.
[SPEAKER_04]: They threw a dart at the map and it landed
in Trump Tower.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for better or worse, this is the train
we're riding for the next four years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And honestly, if the community doesn't do
what it needs to do and step up and unify
[SPEAKER_04]: now, we might not be here for eight years.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really wouldn't take much to undo
everything we've done if they decided to
[SPEAKER_04]: undo it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay positive, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't let Mike put you in a bleak mood.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, just just get on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we all get on it, we win.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the simple fact is it's a numbers
game.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's six thousand FBI agents.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's 20 million American spot pot
smokers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking come at me, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was Mike speaking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't come at me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm chilling.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I'm the only one that says that,
like that statement doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_04]: If even half of the 20 million people
stand up and call a congressman and say,
[SPEAKER_04]: do not support going after recreational
marijuana, at minimum let states continue
[SPEAKER_04]: to do what they've been doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's all you have to do and say you
don't have to.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so and so and I live at this address
and I believe this because of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to do any of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just how you represent me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please don't vote to go after marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all you have to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's super easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: If even half the people that smoke pot
this year make one phone call to a senator
[SPEAKER_04]: or representative, we win this in a
landslide.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the reality is one in thirty five will
make a phone call.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys make a phone call.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make a phone call.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who do they call exactly?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're they're elected officials.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got two that matter in this vote.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're elected senator and you're less
elected House of Representatives member.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can hop on Google and just type in
who is my senator.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it will ask you to punch in your area
code.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it will give you their office
phone number, direct line to their
[SPEAKER_04]: voicemail, their direct email line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Call them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Speak.
[SPEAKER_04]: Call an email.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, my name is Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: I live in your your district.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please don't vote to to shut down state
marijuana businesses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Leave recreational and medical marijuana
alone.
