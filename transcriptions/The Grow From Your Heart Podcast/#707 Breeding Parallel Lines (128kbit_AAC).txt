[SPEAKER_00]: Alright I don't want to ramble too much
here at the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently I was on my Instagram live feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right every Monday I do an
Instagram live at 7-10 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain Time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm dealing with the Mountain Time zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every Monday 7-10 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain Time I do an Instagram live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on my Instagram account irey
underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is me on Instagram irey underscore
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use that one for the live feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a podcast Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't post enough there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try but I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: irey underscore genetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do an Instagram live show every Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a recent live show we started talking
about labeling and going deeper into
[SPEAKER_00]: labeling and somebody asked me the
question about F1s and then they asked me
[SPEAKER_00]: the question about what does V mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody noted that the letter V was on a
seed pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently we talked about the BX.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we are going to talk about V and we're
going to lead that into further breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: down the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about parallel
breeding in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start the conversation off
talking about V.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you buy a package of seeds and it's got
the letter V marked on there somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: that can be very confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does the letter V mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not see the package that my friend
was talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not exactly sure but I have a good
idea of exactly the breeder probably the
[SPEAKER_00]: line of seeds that it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can give a good example of what I
expect and I assume this V means.
[SPEAKER_00]: The V means it is version.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just say hypothetically that I
made a rise F2s and there were different
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes that I liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would run a bunch of seeds and I would
label them probably number 1 through 25 or
[SPEAKER_00]: 1 through 100 or maybe they would be
letters A through Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just kind of depends on how I'm feeling
when I make the labels that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case we're going to say they were
labeled numbers 1 through 25 and then I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to grow those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may find two that I really like that
have two totally distinct traits,
[SPEAKER_00]: features, two different phenotypes that
really they're both keepers in totally
[SPEAKER_00]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I may work more with those plants in
the future and to indicate that I chose
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe I got an Arise plant that was super
sticky and super potent and then maybe I
[SPEAKER_00]: got another Arise plant that tastes really
good and grows really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would indicate those by saying like
version A and version B and then on the
[SPEAKER_00]: website I would go and indicate very
clearly the differences between version A
[SPEAKER_00]: and version B.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the V just means version.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either version A or version B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Possibly version 2.0 is something I've
also seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that I have indicated that is I've
just simply given the plants different
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see Arise F2 number 4,
Arise F2 number 8.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Arise F2 letter E.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the way I did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are different selections of the
Arise phenotypes that I chose to continue
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is all that indicates is a V for
version.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright I am back after a quick technical
adjustment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you didn't notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through the magic of editing you will not
notice a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's stay on track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about versions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did say I was going to talk about
polyhybrids, F1s and breeding parallel
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to unravel that ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes in the show I talk about F1s
and F1 is known as when we take two plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and cross them together for the first
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I take plant A that doesn't even need a
name and plant B and I breed them
[SPEAKER_00]: together, the seeds that come from that,
that's called the progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the first filial generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now my friend F1 Pete, his head just
completely exploded because unless we've
[SPEAKER_00]: done some work before that or some very
careful selection that is not really an
[SPEAKER_00]: F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be labeled an F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technically what we just made is a
polyhybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just pollen chucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just grabbing plant A, plant B,
putting them in a room because that one
[SPEAKER_00]: was called something cookies and that was
called something cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that something cookies and
something cake would be a cool fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: strain name that will sell me a lot of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put them in a room and I let them
fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I got a bunch of seeds and those
are just polyhybrid hype seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're into polyhybrids, there's
nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've done, if that's what you want,
that's your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is not an F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about what would make an F1 and
what the difference is between a
[SPEAKER_00]: polyhybrid and an F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main word is breeding two.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing is breeding two
heterozygous plants together to create an
[SPEAKER_00]: F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're taking something that's really
OG Kush dominant and a lot of Kush on this
[SPEAKER_00]: side and a lot of Kush on this side,
you're just kind of pollen chucking and
[SPEAKER_00]: putting Kush and other ingredients
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do some work, do some building
blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about how to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will also take us back to the
versions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main, when I'm breeding,
one of the things I really look for is
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding plants that are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would I want to take two strawberries
and make strawberries together and get
[SPEAKER_00]: double strawberries?
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't make any sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to take strawberries and
blueberries or strawberries and chocolate
[SPEAKER_00]: or strawberries and not even bananas
because that's too cliche.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about strawberries and garlic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just fuck it all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do things weird and breed that and
try to complement both plants and see what
[SPEAKER_00]: they both do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that helps us get to that F1 stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my example, again, I'm going to go
back to making a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to work with a golden goat
female and we're going to focus on a
[SPEAKER_00]: daybreaker male.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we're going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to flower them out and I'm going
to get pollen from the daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put the pollen on the golden
goat female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have now made a rise F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a real thing that I've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've called that a rise F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be debatably an F1,
debatably, you could de blade it if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that may not be a true F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants were so far apart,
I think in appearance in genetics and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that I think I made an F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe people would argue that and I would
accept your argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be a polyhybrid if you want to
call it that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about what I could do to
further turn this plant into a true F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we want to really fit that label that
our friend F1 Pete would like to see this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant fall into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friend F1 Pete.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a very inspiring, very
knowledgeable dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you did inspire a lot of this and I
learned a lot from you brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got my first arise F1 or my
polyhybrid stash of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: From there, I'm going to find a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go back to talking about the
versions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the versions are going to
come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me keep myself on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: From there I'm going to grow them out and
I'm going to find traits that I really
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just what you do when you get
seeds, a batch of new seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look for the traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are these new?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the progeny express?
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow as many as you can and through
that population you take a lot of notes
[SPEAKER_00]: and you say this is a common trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a common trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really common.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25% of the plants show me this.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 show me this.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50% of the plants show me this.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10% of the plants did this weird shit over
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10% of the plants did this amazing thing
over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a lot of notes and see what you have
created.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that plant in different environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stress it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run it as many times as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what you can do with this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: How it reacts to different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, then if you really want to go
further, find there are going to be two
[SPEAKER_00]: different traits that you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two different plants that you're looking
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to pick two very specific
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, we're going to say on this
side we have found a plant that is super
[SPEAKER_00]: potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time we smoke it, I said this
before, your brain flies out of your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got fireworks going off every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to stick with a super potent
plant on this side.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other side, I'm going to stick with
something we all enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terps flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever your favorite flavor is,
that is on this side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got one line of plants that are
nothing but potency and one breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: project that is nothing but flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: An easy way to achieve this, one way we
can do this is to use the same male or two
[SPEAKER_00]: different males.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you found two males that you really
like, you want to run two totally
[SPEAKER_00]: different breeding projects, that is
acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great way to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can run one male or two males.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will work however you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you have found the plants that
meet the criteria and reach the goals you
[SPEAKER_00]: were looking for, you can do two different
males or the same male.
[SPEAKER_00]: That won't make a difference in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're going to do, we're going to
find that female super potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find another female super flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to pollinate them with
our male of choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either, it's got to be the same
filial generation is the most important
[SPEAKER_00]: part here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be the same male, could be two
different males, as long as they came from
[SPEAKER_00]: the same batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we are going to find that perfect
male, that perfect male if it's one or
[SPEAKER_00]: two, find our perfect females.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our female A and female B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to pollinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, we have made two separate
batches of F2 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have made F2 batch A and F2 batch B.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do this at separate times.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got, if you're doing different
males, you might want to do it in separate
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms at different times so you don't
cross pollinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using one male, you can do this
in one room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pollinate plant A and plant B.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you don't mix up the seeds when
you're done, that will work out
[SPEAKER_00]: beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you would do, what I would do,
you've made the F1 or the polyhybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: generation, find a solid male.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, I found King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would find a female, nothing but
potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: A female over here, nothing but terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying nothing but.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't be saying it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want structure, vigor, pathogen
resistance, bug resistance, all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other things you desire in a plant that
you're going to breed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, let's focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90% of your focus is going to be on the
trichomes, on the potency over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm exaggerating that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's hyperbole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of our focus, we're breeding mostly
for potency over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other side, breeding mostly for
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to get your, you're going
to select that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have your male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would take that male and pollinate
both of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I have now made the F2, or I guess
it's the F2, but not really the true F2
[SPEAKER_00]: working toward our real F1 is where we're
headed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to make new seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take this batch over here
that I'm breeding just for flavor,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm going to find another boy and
another girl out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this selection process, I am focused
once again on structure, vigor,
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance to problems, but I am focusing
mainly on flavor, once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I found that perfect male and perfect
female out of my F2 batch of this batch of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds out of batch A, I don't remember
which side was batch A and which side was
[SPEAKER_00]: which B, batch B, but we're just going to
act like this is flavor batch over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make F3.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to find a beautiful flavored
plant again, and we're going to make F4.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go all the way to F5 or F6.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go until these plants come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I grow them, they are stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stability means that all of the plants are
uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uniformity among phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to find a bunch of
different phenotypes in the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not going to be any differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to look like we put a bunch
of clones out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how far I'm going to breed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do my selection properly,
F5 should get me there.
[SPEAKER_00]: F6 will really lock it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are we going to do with these
other plants that were focused on the
[SPEAKER_00]: potency side?
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my F1 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to find a boy and a girl across
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a boy and a girl that are highly
potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cross those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep going up like this, like there's a
chart in front of me, but there is in my
[SPEAKER_00]: head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to do that to both lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I'm calling parallel lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same genotype, but I'm choosing
different phenotypes with different goals
[SPEAKER_00]: in mind for my breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I'm just breeding for potency,
just breeding for flavor in two separate
[SPEAKER_00]: projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to use the same batch of seeds
over here to make this work, and the same
[SPEAKER_00]: batch of seeds over here that is allotted
for this project over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency seeds have to stay in the
potency rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor seeds have to stay in the
flavor rain and run right up that side of
[SPEAKER_00]: the chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to have F2, F3,
F4, F5, F6, both of them right up each
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once we get to that F5, F6 level and
we feel like we've got exactly what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for from our phenotypes,
we're going to find a beautifully
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly structured, pathogen resistant,
bug resistant, not problematic plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: is ideal for our grow room that has got
the most amazing fucking flavor you could
[SPEAKER_00]: ever find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever flavor you think of when you
close your eyes and you inhale that
[SPEAKER_00]: imaginary joint or imaginary dab or
imaginary bong rip and you go whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor that is that hits your tongue,
this plant tastes just like that times
[SPEAKER_00]: five.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost overwhelming, almost
overpowering because we've bred it just
[SPEAKER_00]: focusing on that delicious terpene
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to find one over here on
the other side on the potency side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you open the bag, you don't even
have to light it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even have to put fire on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just go, oh shit, I'm too high to
drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody else has to drive the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how high I want you to get from
that weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to find a phenotype that is
perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, which one, which one do we choose for
the male?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say choose the potency side for
the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be my idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now what we're going to do,
we're going to cross these together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take our F6s from each side
or F5 from each side and pick your potency
[SPEAKER_00]: male and your flavorful female and cross
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's breed those together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, my friends, we have made a true F1
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've taken these parents that were Golden
Goat and Daybreaker and we made the
[SPEAKER_00]: polyhybrid version part one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we selected version A and version B
and we bred them to F2, F3, F4,
[SPEAKER_00]: F5, F6.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we found our crown jewels out of
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We bred those together and we made fucking
super arise the true F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a baddie.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like a lifelong project for a lot
of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think that that's something you
should get done in just a few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you rush it, you fuck that project up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you ever have to go backwards,
if one of your selections wasn't what you
[SPEAKER_00]: thought it should be, if you liked the
filial generation before, never be afraid
[SPEAKER_00]: to go back and crack more seeds from that
generation before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the phenotype out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know when you mess up, you'll see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be two generations back,
but you'll know which generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you're breeding filial generations
and you see a problem pop up, you'll go,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh yeah, that was in two generations back
and I was too stubborn to get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have tossed that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked that plant because it did that
other thing that I liked and I accepted
[SPEAKER_00]: the crazy thing just because it had that
other cool trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to go backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always keep seed stock from every filial
generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're making F2s, F3s, F4s,
you should have F1, 2, 3, and 4 seed stock
[SPEAKER_00]: just on reserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, just in case you did not make
the appropriate, the correct selection
[SPEAKER_00]: every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe later on you want to take that F6 or
F5 and back cross it to an F2 or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you start doing this, you'll see why
breeding becomes so, I guess, addicting is
[SPEAKER_00]: the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll see how it also becomes
very predictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you do it a lot, you can almost
anticipate what's going to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you learn the plants, if you understand
what's happening, you have to breed with
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: To see how much of that male goes into the
mix and how much of that female goes into
[SPEAKER_00]: the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll see that different males
and females interact differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the only way to do that really is to
breed some plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So man, I guess that is my quick wrap-up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I covered that correctly and
appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to get roasted on something I
said there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, I look forward to it because
that is how I learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: My audience holds me to a high standard
and I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what I messed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me your corrections, corrections,
comments, concerns, constructive
[SPEAKER_00]: criticism, criticism, that also.
[SPEAKER_00]: But send me your constructive criticism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please be polite about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any notes in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you, I'll tell you what my notes
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the letters P and then a graph
that goes like this and it says poly slash
[SPEAKER_00]: F1 and then AB and then F1 all the way
down to F6 is what I wrote.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a circle F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to show you my chicken
scratches of notes because that's my brain
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's embarrassing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's how many notes I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope I got that correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I've got faith in myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that came out right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I am not afraid to be corrected
and educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're all here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls,
pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers,

[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take a couple of more dabs before I
record the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked some lemon wreath from Green Dot.

but that's what got me talking 7,000 miles
[SPEAKER_00]: an hour.
