[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for episode number 283 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a source for cannabis news,
education, and conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_03]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_03]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_03]: for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_03]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_03]: Roots Band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to Kat, Coot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ladies and gentlemen, thanks again for
joining me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I usually like to start off the podcast by
talking about what I'm smoking on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today, I am dabbing on some stuff that I
have named Fireberry, and we'll talk about
[SPEAKER_03]: that more in the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: This podcast was recorded live in Colorado
Springs at the Studio A-64 Smoke Lounge,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I was joined by my friends,
Jeremy and Cheryl, who are also known as
[SPEAKER_03]: Love For The Plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're on Instagram, so please check them
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: This episode was over an hour long,
so I'm gonna cut the intro short,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we're just gonna roll right into the
recording with Jeremy and Cheryl.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for listening, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for joining me, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you for having us.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, to start off, we just smoked some of
this concentrate you guys brought me.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is some live resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is 75% Firefly and 25% Memberberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have named it Fireberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's from our friends Love For The Plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: They grew it in their little compact grow
that we're gonna talk about here in a
[SPEAKER_03]: minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we reveal who did the extraction,
or should that remain anonymous?
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't know the best way of calling
him out right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well then, a very skilled extractor
made some great concentrates out of their
[SPEAKER_03]: flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, I bred the Firefly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our friend Colin at the Ethos Collective
made the Memberberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just took a dab of this concentrate,
and I think I described it as the
[SPEAKER_03]: strawberry kiwi or something with mangoes
in it from Snapple.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's a strawberry kiwi mango
Snapple, that's what it would be,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I don't think that's real.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it definitely had a strawberry kiwi
flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember those candies?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're strawberries and grandma had them
in the little coffee dish, and it had a
[SPEAKER_03]: strawberry wrapper, and you'd bite into
it, and the middle would get kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: gooey?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of what it reminded me of,
but more of a tropical thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, man, great job on that, and thank you
for the amazing gift.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our pleasure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a couple of notes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just gonna segue right into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was grown in a very, very small grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just showed me pictures of that grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a four by four-tenth that that was
flowered in?
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a two by four-tenth.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a two by four-tenth.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got it packed with buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just saw towering buds through the whole
thing.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good work in such a small tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are on our seventh grow now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seventh grow, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: In that tent?
[SPEAKER_03]: In that tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your average weight coming out of a
two by four-tenth, if you don't mind me
[SPEAKER_03]: asking the average harvest?
[SPEAKER_02]: Average, just under a pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've gotten over a pound,
so with that super silver haze,
[SPEAKER_02]: we got over a pound.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: With super silver haze, okay, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sativa will give you some extra
weight for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: How was the quality of that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I had some fox telling at the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super silver haze will do that almost no
matter what you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, she's gonna do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just kind of what a haze will do
because she's from a tropical environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: She doesn't want to get sweaty,
so she'll spread out to keep herself from
[SPEAKER_03]: getting mildewy, so she's helping you out
by doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the flavor of it came out a little
bit more earthy than what we were looking
[SPEAKER_02]: for, but that's just our taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna talk about flavors here pretty
soon because Cheryl had some questions
[SPEAKER_03]: about flavors.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the way you approach that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, have you guys heard the episode I was
talking about about the buds with the more
[SPEAKER_03]: surface area or have potential to have
more THC because there's more surface
[SPEAKER_03]: area?
[SPEAKER_02]: I did hear that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I think hazes and things like
that seem to get you a little higher.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a little more space for more
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes so much sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's fingering on a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I compared it to, imagine if you closed
your fist and dunked it into some powdered
[SPEAKER_03]: sugar and you only have this much space
for trichome, then you open your hand,
[SPEAKER_03]: dunk it into powdered sugar, now you have
that extra space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so that's what I'm thinking.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why the haze fox-tailed out like
that a little bit and give you a little
[SPEAKER_03]: more room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it added the extra weight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I might be getting a buzzing
in my headphone, but if it's in the
[SPEAKER_03]: recording, I can fix it later.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that was done in a very small garden
at 2x4.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get over a pound.
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of lights are you using in
there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I have two different LEDs at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing a advanced platinum LED.
[SPEAKER_02]: They call it the P300.
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually pulls at like 185 watts.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, let me back up on that
advanced LED.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all three watt diodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the other LED that I've just recently
moved to, it's a company called Advanced
[SPEAKER_02]: LED.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not Advanced Platinum LED, but just
Advanced LED.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're actually a company out of
Arkansas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pure coincidence that I'm from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about that also.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great segue.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, that light has the 10 watt
Cree bulbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like that mixed in with the 3
watt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that offers a better light
spectrum for the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel like one side produces better
than another side?
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen a noticeable difference in
yield or quality between the two lights,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I do feel like it almost just makes me
feel better knowing that I have a mix of
[SPEAKER_02]: having those Cree bulbs mixed in with
those three watt bulbs.
[SPEAKER_03]: The more colors, the better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and I'll also say those Cree bulbs
offer the white light, whereas the other
[SPEAKER_02]: LED, it's that purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your photos are pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the colors from the lights in your
photos.
[SPEAKER_03]: They definitely look cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm kind of impressed that you're
pulling that from LED lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I ask what your light bill is every
month from that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, Cheryl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pay the electricity bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have not paid over $91,
and that's for our entire apartment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is with running the AC or running the
heater, vegging, flowering, and all
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're on our seventh grow,
and I haven't paid over $91 a month yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's super impressive because when I
tell my friends that are setting up a new
[SPEAKER_03]: grow and they're going to run an HPS
light, like 1,000 watt, I tell them to
[SPEAKER_03]: expect a $100 a month increase for the
light, the fan, and whatever cooling it's
[SPEAKER_03]: going to take to keep that cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So $91, and you're pulling a pound every
crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I talk about your veg space?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just showed me a picture of your veg
space.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can edit this part out if I need to.
[SPEAKER_03]: You told me that you had your mom
visiting, and she had no idea that you
[SPEAKER_03]: were vegging in your living room,
basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was Cheryl's mother that was
visiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom, she's very in support of us,
but it wasn't until she actually visited
[SPEAKER_00]: where it really made sense to her.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she comes in, and in our living room,
we have this, you know, your very basic,
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty arm wire that you order off of
Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it looks like when you open it,
maybe a TV in there, and you couldn't hear
[SPEAKER_00]: or smell anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my mom obviously noticed this
beautiful new addition to our living room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after she was there for a while,
I was like, Mom, come check this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you open it, it's like, whoa!
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like all this beautiful green
goodness and smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she could not believe it.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you showed me the pictures,
I was impressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've seen a lot of grows and grown a
lot myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like you went to Pier One and got
a little armoire and put it in the living
[SPEAKER_03]: room, put some flowers on top of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like you'd open it, and there
would probably be, you know, I'd expect
[SPEAKER_03]: some CDs in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The things that you hide, you know,
the crap you don't want everyone to see
[SPEAKER_03]: when they come over, like all your art
supplies, whatever, cram it all into
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you open it up, and it's got a little
hydro setup with two spots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you put hydro buckets in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, that's not hydro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a cutout for the containers to sit
down in.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is so smart.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're not sitting on the floor,
they hover in there?
Correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can pull them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is genius.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you got you an LED light up on
top, a platinum, the platinum LED.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't read much more.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you got your carbon filter up
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so all that's running.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Mom had no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was just kind of like light
white noise is how I would describe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you just have, you know,
everyone's excited or talking or the TV's
[SPEAKER_00]: on, you know, lightly or even music,
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really don't pay attention or even if
the AC is running at the same time or
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might just confuse it for the house
AC.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty smooth.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty incognito there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so just keep it quiet.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one would even notice.
[SPEAKER_03]: How did you guys keep the odor down in
flour?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just carbon filters like normal?
[SPEAKER_03]: The fresh filter does it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fresh filter does it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you work for them?
[SPEAKER_03]: Grab the mic closer to your face.
[SPEAKER_03]: As Joe Rogan would say, eat that thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Say that again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Say that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give that quote again so you can get paid
for that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fresh filter takes care of 100% of the
odor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm sure, you know,
microscopically, scientifically it's not a
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred percent, but we don't even get a
hint of it when we are replacing them as
[SPEAKER_02]: often as recommended.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we wanted to segue, I was going to,
do you want to tell us any more about your
[SPEAKER_03]: grow?
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't let me skip out on anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great little grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm impressed with that tiny grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will talk about the contrast between
the, you know, modifying existing
[SPEAKER_02]: furniture, you know, the benefit of
modifying existing furniture to be a grow
[SPEAKER_02]: space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it flows with the natural environment
of that room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's a little bit more stealth,
but I will warn everyone, it's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell the inside of that cabinet is a
lot of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are drilling holes for ventilation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course you have to align the entire
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are so many things to take into
account.
[SPEAKER_02]: Light deprivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would be surprised, especially with
this cheap furniture, how hard it is to
[SPEAKER_02]: keep a hundred percent of the light out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people don't understand what 100% of
the light means either.
[SPEAKER_03]: They think that a little bit of light
means 100% dark and no, dark all the way
[SPEAKER_03]: dark, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, the clear disadvantages,
it's a lot of work to design the
[SPEAKER_02]: advantages.
[SPEAKER_02]: Advantage is it's going to be as stealth
as you want it to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas the tent, it's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plug and play.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have your ports ready, you know,
your ventilation ports, your things to
[SPEAKER_02]: hang your lights from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything is ready to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're losing a little bit of
stealthiness there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now actually you bring up a great point
though with the, yes, it looks like a
[SPEAKER_02]: tent, but if the tent is small enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the tent is small enough, two by four,
I'd say smaller, you know, we're two by
[SPEAKER_02]: four is as big as I would want to go if
you want to remain stealth.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we just stack boxes on top of it,
around it, just make it look like clutter
[SPEAKER_02]: and it works great.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've distract the eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like any type of like cloth
closet that you could buy at Bed Bath and
[SPEAKER_00]: Beyond to store extra clothes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks exactly like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's almost the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The zipper is in the same direction,
you know, so it's very incognito.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's black.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can just blend it in if you put
some towels near it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually this one more small point,
something I've learned is I bought a very
[SPEAKER_02]: cheap tent on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, you know, I think I paid $50
for this two by four.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the drawback of those cheap tents
is they will have small light leaks.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you buy a Gorilla Grow tent,
it's great, but they're two, $300 for an
[SPEAKER_02]: equivalent size.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even those have light leaks sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's good to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I found, or at least what we are doing,
if you are on a budget, just buy a cheap
[SPEAKER_02]: tent and then buy a $10 black sheet to lay
over it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just keep that sheet laid over it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I go to open up the tent,
just raise the sheet up, unzip the tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, so for $50 for the Grow
tent, $10 for a sheet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have a great tent solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're pulling out a pound every 60 days,
it looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every 70 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: My biggest expense was buying high end
LED.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, obviously there are many options
for LED out there and I chose the higher
[SPEAKER_02]: end.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was clearly my biggest expense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looks like it was worth the extra
investment because you're pulling a great
[SPEAKER_03]: crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you want top shelf,
you have to pay for it with LED.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you guys hear that?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want top shelf, you have to pay for
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's with everything, not just with LED.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't cheap out you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: People say, well, those nutrients are too
expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at the product I'm growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's stopping you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spend the money.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only a few cents more too.
[SPEAKER_03]: People don't realize that.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else you got for me on a small grow,
bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: I love your tips.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was actually a listener that asked
for stealth grow tips and I didn't realize
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to get so much on this
episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is great for me and him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing I would say as far as your
grow medium, your options are about the
[SPEAKER_02]: same as any other indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm choosing, I'm growing in five gallon
containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thinking about going to seven because I'm
using a high quality soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to keep a pro-microbial
environment in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not doing no-till.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you hand watering or are you doing
any?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hand watering.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I think I'm going to the larger
containers just to support some of that
[SPEAKER_02]: organic matter a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still learning about all of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll also be watering less.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Less frequently because I have more area
to keep alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I like about seven gallon pots
is I have to water them on Monday and then
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe Thursday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then Monday again and Thursday.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get two waterings a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: So two seven gallon pots in a two by four
tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I sometimes wonder, why don't I just
put a big bed in here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just make this whole tent a big no-till
bed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what a lot of my friends would tell
you to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what Barefoot would say.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what Frosty would say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sean's probably going, do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all yelling right now,
chatting for you to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But being in a small apartment,
that's just the predatory mites and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything in an apartment.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I had my own home, it would be
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would all contain itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think- Do you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is good to hear.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not my area of expertise in any
way, but I have a personal grow and I use
[SPEAKER_03]: predatory mites in my personal grow
because I don't want to apply any
[SPEAKER_03]: pesticides because I'm breeding and I
don't want to ruin my plants that are
[SPEAKER_03]: going to get sprayed.
[SPEAKER_03]: With pesticides, then they can't receive
pollen as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't want to ruin the seeds by
spraying them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I use predatory mites and I don't feel
like they spread throughout my house.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like they stay on the plants and
they eat the bugs that are there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when they get bored, they die and
eat themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have renewed hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In every grow that we've done,
we've modified it in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're saying next time growing in
different pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got really excited talking about
no-till with some people here in Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: Springs yesterday and we were envisioning
how we could make it work in our tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at first we didn't think that was
really possible, but the more that we've
[SPEAKER_03]: learned- It would almost be easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because then you don't have to replace
soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to make soil in your
apartment.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to dispose of soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the stuff that comes out goes back in
basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it would be maybe more effective for
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I figure by the time we have it figured
out, we'll have a larger space.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Living in Denver, it's expensive to get a
house, so I'm kind of impressed that
[SPEAKER_03]: you're able to grow in the small apartment
space you've got.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you worry about maybe your neighbors
are growing also and you're going to get
[SPEAKER_03]: their bugs or anything?
[SPEAKER_02]: They come and inspect our apartments on a
pretty regular basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think there are many growers in
our complex.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody that's got the effort that you guys
are going to make to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know they are around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are more growers than we would
assume.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when it came out that it was
legal to grow and then you'd just start
[SPEAKER_03]: seeing people's ducting coming out of
their back windows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you've been doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long has that been there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that it's changed a little bit,
you see them going away.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the wave when the hydro stores all
got rich because everybody thought,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to grow my six plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they grew six and they got their
extended plant count and they grew 20.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they realized this is harder than
it looks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you see all their shit on
Craigslist.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've driven around the city and like
looking up in the big residential
[SPEAKER_00]: buildings, you can see different colors of
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know what some of the lights look
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes we're like, dude,
you think they're growing up there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That light.
[SPEAKER_03]: The always lovely, always beautiful Ms.
Jenny Beth and I drove by a garage in
[SPEAKER_03]: Pueblo a few weeks ago and it's just lined
with silver.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you could tell they're in there
hanging up the mylar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, dude, cover that window
before you get to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be a dope grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could see literally a dope grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a nice grow in that
garage.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I could see you're hanging mylar in
there at 11 o'clock at night, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might want to think twice about what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to hang the mylar and then
roll up the door and carry the lights in
[SPEAKER_03]: and hang them too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be a little more careful you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it sounds like I have some organic
homework to do and I need to take it to
[SPEAKER_02]: the next level.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen to the episode with Frosty and
myself and then, hey, Frosty, it's time to
[SPEAKER_03]: get you back on the podcast, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you listen.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an official invitation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get Frosty Organics back on the
show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to turn this down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something is buzzing in my headphones.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not coming through on your guys'
voices, but it is on mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So everybody, I apologize if I'm buzzing
in the recording.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will do my best to fix it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure I know what I just did to
fix it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got a lot of notes, my friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not want to skip anything on your
stealth grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get started, I'll just say this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Firefly was my first seed to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And seeing the phenotypical variances was,
as a newer grower, it was very eye-opening
[SPEAKER_02]: for me.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I just have this overflowing energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to phenohunt everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everywhere I go, I see seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just, I got to get these seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes harvesting different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to pop 100 of them and see what I
get.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it does make harvesting different.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to keep things separate and
label, and then you got to dry them and
[SPEAKER_03]: cure them and smoke them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You started paying much more attention to
detail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad I was able to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it definitely is the next level in
growing for me as a beginner, and it has
[SPEAKER_02]: provided a renewed excitement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I was ever plateauing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been passionate since I met you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, not that I was ever plateauing,
but yeah, it definitely accelerated my
[SPEAKER_02]: enthusiasm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to start with the first?
[SPEAKER_03]: These are from the seeds I gave you at the
Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we first met you, the very first
night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we can rewind a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: We probably should have said this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had just pressed record and we started
talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys were listeners of my podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also Bo Nellis' podcast, The Spliff,
which is on a hiatus while Bo is working,
[SPEAKER_03]: doing a bunch of other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bo, we miss you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Bo.
[SPEAKER_03]: We miss you, Bo.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd love to hear a few episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come visit us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey everyone, Bo Nellis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for The Spliff podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Miss you, Bo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do some shows for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come do a show with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they were messaging me.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were talking on Instagram and they were
saying, Hey, we listened to Bo.
[SPEAKER_03]: We listened to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd love to meet up sometime.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, sounds great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to make it happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am super busy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they're like, we're going to the
Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, I hope to see you guys
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were in line and you guys just
walked right up and said, hello,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause some people seem, I hear about it
later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I saw you in line and I didn't say
hi.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, well, that's a way to be my
friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys came right up and said,
what's up you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And another guy named Tony and his friend
who was real quiet in his name.
[SPEAKER_03]: I already forgot cause he was so quiet,
but I met you guys in line there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I gave you some seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I gave you Firefly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the first time we met in
person.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll just say, when Jeff says come up
and talk to him, he's not just saying
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he's serious.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was, I felt like I've known him
for 10 years when I woke up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: People say I'm intimidating looking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am six foot five.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, I'm six foot five and like 200
pounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got dreadlocks that hang past my
butt.
[SPEAKER_03]: My eyes are bright red and I'm,
I'm not fat, but I'm not skinny.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in shape.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can handle myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if, if I need to be intimidating,
I can't, but I'm not, I'm not trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: be, I got a beard and a mustache.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I look like I'm going to commit a
crime or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm chilling.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to smoke some dabs with you and
hear about your grow and look at your
[SPEAKER_03]: pictures on your phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that's 90% of the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: People show up and like, look at the
pictures I grew.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we start looking at each other's
phones and talking about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, we become friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're cool, come talk to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you've got a problem, come talk to
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we'll take a dab and solve that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying to be intimidating.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a weed breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a Rasta man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm, I'm chilling.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have a good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may end up on the podcast like these
folks did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were just going to go up and say
hello to you and just sesh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we could.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had been in the market for seeds
because we had already grown several
[SPEAKER_00]: clones and had a couple grows under our
belt by then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, we were, you were like,
yeah, we really need to start growing from
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were, you know, thinking about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we just met you that night and it
was serendipitous.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then here we are just standing in line
with time to kill, making new friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had no idea it would end up like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It worked out beautifully.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I give seeds away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's planting seeds, starting
relationships and building friendships
[SPEAKER_03]: that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And man has it expanded our knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can actually see on your guys's feed how
excited you are about growing from the
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause there's more pictures of the stuff
from seed than anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have done me proud with the
concentrate so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're going to show me the first
sample.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like I'm going to tell everybody
what firefly is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll talk about that for just a
second.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Firefly is a lemon skunk female.
[SPEAKER_03]: The lemon skunk was from seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also it's a greenhouse seeds, lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had that for years, probably since
2008, 2010.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had that lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have that lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the same lemon skunk that I used to
make lemon Jeffrey, but it was pollinated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Firefly was made with the lemon skunk and
arise the arise male known as Solomon,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is a golden goat as a female and
daybreaker as a male.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's, that's a whole bunch of great
lineups in there to make a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: great stuff, but it's got the lemon turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made it trying to make a big lemony
flavored plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to make kind of another lemon
Jeffrey, but bigger was my goal and maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: more resin and more of a Kush flavor
instead of the lemon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a lemon Kush thing was kind of my
goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys have the flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where it came from.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think I, how close do you
think I got to that lemony Kush thing?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we brought with us today are,
well, we grew out five phenos.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, we brought three with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one definitely has a, a distinct
lemon smell to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second one has such a strong lemon
smell that I can't wait for you to smell
[SPEAKER_03]: it because I'm curious how this- The first
one, he's got a small jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second one, she just reached for a big
ass jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell which one you like.
[SPEAKER_02]: These were different harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: These, this one has an extra couple months
of curing on it, but I will say that the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the variances, the variance that you will,
that you will smell between them are,
[SPEAKER_02]: they were there before the two months of
curing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyways, yeah, the second one there's,
it's so lemony that- I labeled it that
[SPEAKER_02]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I would have made concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I can't wait for you to try that
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then this third one, that's the one that I
really want to talk about because we don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have as refined of a palette as many.
[SPEAKER_02]: We obviously, we know what lemon smells
like, you know, or we know what orange
[SPEAKER_02]: smells like.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once we, and I, and I even know what
diesel smells like, you know, like on a
[SPEAKER_02]: sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once we start getting into like
different strains where you say,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, this is gassy or this is Kimmy,
you know, this has a Kim smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where we, we both get a little bit
lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this third one has one of those
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I can't wait for you to smell it
and tell us what the hell we're smelling.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I was just going to say really quickly
is these two phenos, the ones that I have
[SPEAKER_00]: lemon and just non-lemon, I didn't know
whether to put that gassy, those questions
[SPEAKER_00]: we were going to ask you is these have
been curing for a little over 30 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted, cause he told you how long
this one, how old it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted you to know this one,
a little over 30 days for this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Earlier we were talking about the smells,
Kim, gas, diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I tried to describe it a little bit in
what I think of gas is obvious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I think gas, it smells like unleaded.
[SPEAKER_03]: You pull up to the gas station,
you get that gas smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it gets sharper, maybe might be the
word for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little spicier.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's when it turns into like
fuel or diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when, and that's just when the
labels will change.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I guess I'm kind of turning into
the wine guy, the wine descriptor guy
[SPEAKER_03]: can't say the word properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what the word is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's Wade Ridley when you need him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He knows how to say that word for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, really close.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just say it wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't speak French, but yeah,
I feel like I'm the wine or the weed
[SPEAKER_03]: version of that guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you go from the gassy to a little bit
sharper.
[SPEAKER_03]: You start getting the fuel and the diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when you kind of tone it down,
and it gets muted, but earthy maybe,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's when I think it starts turning into
Kim.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when it gets swampy and
chocolatey, that's kind of when I think it
[SPEAKER_03]: turns into OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's that like diesel, Kush,
Kim, OG wheel there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in my head, that could be my own
flavor palette in my head.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now he's going to bust one out and be
like, which one is this?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm excited for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with the first one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll begin with the one that we harvested
first.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I can smell it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a foot away from me and I can smell
that thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good trim job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I listened to your trimming
critiques.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, good trim job.
[SPEAKER_03]: I take great pleasure in that part.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a, I can smell both parents in
here completely.
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing that smells like lemon sorbet or
like a lemon, like a soft ice cream,
[SPEAKER_03]: that is definitely the lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's that, it's got a,
oh, what is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a hint of coffee and cheese.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is from the daybreaker parent in
there coming from a rise.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Joseph OG putting a little cheese
in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That probably explains why that one smells
less lemony than the next one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It probably got more of, it actually got
its grandfather in the jeans, which I only
[SPEAKER_03]: know that because I know who its
grandfather is, is Joseph OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can smell the Joseph giving it cheese
and the lemon skunk is giving it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a creamy lemon cheese.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that smells delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although it doesn't sound like good
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smells really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smell it again after I said, creamy lemon
cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't have originally chosen cheese.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a sharp cheddar with lemon meringue
on top, maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is, that sounds like a disgusting
description.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd be like, take that off my plate,
but I want to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I definitely, that smells really
nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good work on that one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So lemon cream and cheese is what I got
from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this next vino that is being put in
front of you, it's the one that had such a
[SPEAKER_02]: distinct lemon smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to pop the lid here with the mic
right by it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was hoping you guys could smell it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you smell it?
[SPEAKER_02]: One day, one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can smell it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that is, that is like mostly lemon
skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is so much lemon skunk right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just sniffing at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, I apologize for the moment of
radio silence.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this one doesn't have as compact of a
bud, but the trim job is great and the
[SPEAKER_03]: trichomes are stacking up and the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought there were far more trichomes on
that one than the first vino.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you think maybe it's because
there's more surface area?
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I, are we learning that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that starting to become a real thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering if my theory is accurate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to kind of just break it a
little bit right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like almost all lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sharp, the tang at the end,
that's golden goat coming through.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: The soft, the lemon skunk I use smells
like a soft lemon ice cream.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's got a, like if you smelled the
lemon head box, not the lemon heads
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves, but the box.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what gives it that smooth smell
and that tang at the end, the orange,
[SPEAKER_03]: where it goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this may be weird when you smell it,
the smell is smooth and the final part of
[SPEAKER_03]: the aroma, it spikes up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if I had to draw the smell on a graph
and I know that's fucking really weird,
[SPEAKER_03]: but if I, it would go smell, smell,
smell wang and that wang at the end,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's the golden goat, giving it a little
twinge.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys did a good job.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's something sour to it too.
[SPEAKER_03]: My fingers smell completely different than
the bud smelled.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had a moment thinking about how
fucking cool this is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting to smell different
phenotypes of a strain that we grew from
[SPEAKER_02]: seed and get to talk about it with the
breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I wasn't trying to make it anything
big like that, but now it's going to be-
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is really fun to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: The trichomes are huge on it and they're
really pressed together.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the trichome heads grew so big,
it had to spread the trichomes out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It almost needed to scrog the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good work on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now drum roll for the one that we can't
figure out, the unknown phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before I open this one, if you had to keep
one of these three, which one would you
[SPEAKER_03]: run again?
[SPEAKER_02]: No doubt the lemon one that you just-
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, a lot of that has to do with
our preference.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do favor these citrus aromas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And berries, the Fruity-mer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can tell by the concentrate you
gave me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so fruity and delicious and yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's probably so far of the two.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one I would grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very similar to the phenotype that
you see in a lot of the pictures of
[SPEAKER_03]: Firefly that I post.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smelled just like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: The concentrates I made were delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is your favorite phenotype of
Firefly?
[SPEAKER_03]: The one that I'm going to discover next
when I grow it?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's very similar to that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the one that- and I give them weird
names in my head, but the sharp one.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one that looked like the leaves were
super serrated and curved up on the edge
[SPEAKER_03]: because I've grown probably a hundred
seeds of that one in different batches.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I noticed that the lemon skunk one
gets these longer leaves that are super
[SPEAKER_03]: serrated on the edges.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's always going to have that lemon
candy smell real nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that one, the one with the serrated and
veg, the leaves will serrate and curve up
[SPEAKER_03]: just a little bit in veg.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how I can find it.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would definitely choose the lemony one
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had forgotten how much I had liked
and hadn't had in so long the lemon skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: and the skunkier strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: I posted a picture of lemon skunk
yesterday and people went crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, where do I get this old
school lemon skunk?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of nostalgic in a way,
in a sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to find some old school stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before I open this one and smell it,
you say it's got a funky smell,
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of a diesel or a chem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did it have really big fan leaves?
[SPEAKER_02]: About average size, I'd say.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say between the two,
one was really bigger than the other.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're growing Firefly, one way that
you can find the one that leans more
[SPEAKER_03]: toward the Joseph O.G.
[SPEAKER_03]: side of thing, it's going to have bigger
leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: The skinnier leaves on this one,
you're going to get more lemon flavor
[SPEAKER_03]: because that golden goat and lemon skunk
is going to come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when Joseph starts kicking in
there, when the daybreaker from Joseph and
[SPEAKER_03]: chem start kicking in, the leaves get
wider.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I really like you doing
these strain reviews because notes like
[SPEAKER_02]: those are notes that you don't necessarily
get in grower goats.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's cheese in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is cheese.
[SPEAKER_02]: How'd you do cheese?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of cheese coming through
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry to interrupt you, but he just
smiled ear to ear.
[SPEAKER_03]: More of that lemon cheese.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it and hate it at the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, that's funky terrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that you're agreeing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's chem.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's Joseph O.G.
[SPEAKER_03]: and Chem D and the daybreaker that I used.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the chem that's given.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's altered by something.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that underlying, the base of that is
Chem D.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then that cheesy thing that's coming
through, that's so weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe when the lemons and the chem are
mixing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just keep sniffing at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, I apologize for this silence in
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing the variance in the three of
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you are definitely getting a cheese
and a lemon meringue cheese kind of thing
[SPEAKER_03]: going on that's very unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of nutrients did you use just
out of curiosity?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the soil that we use, it's
preloaded.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just amend with, I use recharge from
Scotty Rill over at the Do Grow Show.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the first time recharge has ever been
mentioned on my show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I use that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That gets your amino acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Mike said it once.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pro-microbial and I'm not an expert
in that area.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good product.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it has molasses, kelp.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of those things that we are told to
use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I add just a little bit of bio
bloom in the later weeks of flower just to
[SPEAKER_02]: give it that extra nutrient boost.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as I move to a larger container,
I shouldn't have to amend anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to keep smelling that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, you want to take it all out.
[SPEAKER_00]: A handful.
[SPEAKER_03]: So your nutrients aren't making too much
of a difference on the, that's the weed
[SPEAKER_03]: that smells like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that plant that smells that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's flushed and it smells good.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're identical.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, all three of these were grown
identically, same environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: same soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more lemon one I think has the bigger
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one isn't as trichome-y, but that
aroma, there's something very pungent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pungent.
[SPEAKER_03]: How far down the block can you smell that
when you smoke this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't smoked it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, we haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't, but the other one for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can walk in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been making an effort to keep these
to the side until we can do more with
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't get this, the cheese thing when I
grew it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not get any of the cheese smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to grow more seeds and look
for the cheese.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, if you're growing Firefly out
there and you notice cheese in the aroma,
[SPEAKER_03]: let me know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you're getting it from more
than one or two growers, I need to add
[SPEAKER_03]: that in my descriptions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lemon, cream, cheese, and a foot.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a little bit of foot in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just Jeff saying that tells us that that
phenotype is not very common.
[SPEAKER_02]: So having that one as a new grower,
that was when it really solidified that
[SPEAKER_02]: idea that strain names don't mean much to
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, whoa, these are all Firefly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you put two next to each other
that are on opposite ends of the spectrum,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can really see those phenotypical
expressions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: As an entire cannabis community,
I wish we could get down more to the
[SPEAKER_02]: phenol level when we are labeling things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even from a medicinal perspective,
it's very important that we are able to
[SPEAKER_02]: identify things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just saying a strain name, but you
almost have to grow from seed to fully
[SPEAKER_02]: understand that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are only a few, and then you're
going to have arguments.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are going to be like, no,
I've got the this phenotype and I've got
[SPEAKER_03]: the this phenome because there's so much
pissing contest basically in this industry
[SPEAKER_03]: and so much ego that people are just going
to, they're all going to claim they have
[SPEAKER_03]: that phenome.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've all got the forum cookies cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I've got the whatever cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got the platinum cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just turns into a dickslinging
contest at that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just all about egos, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that people, they list candy store
and orange phenome.
[SPEAKER_03]: When they're selling jelly bean,
if they know what they're talking about,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that should be a thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also something that people don't realize
and pay respect to is when you go to the
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensary and you're buying whatever
you're going to get there, we'll say
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to go get ecto cooler.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody already did the pheno hunt for
you and found the best ecto cooler or it
[SPEAKER_03]: would not have made it to the commercial
grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's that's the good one right
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, they have already done that pheno
hunt and they've gone through so many of
[SPEAKER_03]: those.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's something that people
forget about.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, she's showing me some test results.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's a much better screenshot than
what I had before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that say 29.8?
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, this will be a good education
for the viewers because I, or listeners,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I sure did not understand this.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you read those results?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I understand the difference
between THCA and THC, but the way that it
[SPEAKER_02]: listed out there, you can explain to the
listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one labeled lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that we're referring to at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, that's the keeper right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the keeper phenotype.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one that you should have
around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you take clones?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we're just learning to clone ourselves
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're lucky because I brought a big old
bunch of seeds with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a feeling that you might need more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our next project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're building it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cloning is our next level.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have space?
[SPEAKER_03]: You just need one line, a little bit of
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we have that veg armoire.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, OK, we'll teach you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're figuring some things out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it says you have 29.8% THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: THCA and 3% delta 9 THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: THCA is the acid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Delta 9 THC is once it has been converted.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing this without notes, so I hope I
am correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it shows you total potential.
[SPEAKER_03]: Delta 9 THC would be 29.1%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, how do they get that math?
[SPEAKER_03]: For the total THC of 32.8%, there is a
mathematical equation that I found online
[SPEAKER_03]: that I think was written by Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: They break it down exactly how to do that
math.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, I didn't research it
because I didn't know you were going to
[SPEAKER_03]: throw that at me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is a math equation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You add them and then divide a certain
part of it to find the average or
[SPEAKER_03]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're showing you the total
potential.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying there is the potential of
32.8% total cannabinoids in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember the exact difference
between THC and THCA without my notes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's when it breaks down, heat breaks it
down, and it turns it into the acid,
[SPEAKER_03]: the more psychoactive part.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I had done research on that because
I feel like I haven't explained it
[SPEAKER_03]: properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just ballpark, if someone was to ask
you based on those results, what is the
[SPEAKER_02]: THC level of those test results?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just in layman's terms, what would you
answer?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say this test is about 30%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: 29 and 32.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's showing you that those are your
potentials.
[SPEAKER_03]: It found 29.8 in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just say that number.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say 29.8% THCA.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds good.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's accurate that you're not inflating
anything or exaggerating.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to write myself a note to
clarify lab testing as another episode
[SPEAKER_03]: because I wrote lab episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking and writing at the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lab testing is very unclear, honestly,
to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also we're allowed to have a 15%
variance either way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this could have 45% THC or 15% THC,
to tell you the honest truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like to see the results of the
other one?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the one that we had labeled gas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is really cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say cheese.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no cheese in the genetics,
but cheese is a skunk number one
[SPEAKER_03]: phenotype, which who knows what that
really is.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's still great test results.
[SPEAKER_03]: 26.8% and 2.3 on the Delta-9.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it says total potential Delta-9
THC, 25.8.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then total THC, 29.1.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now see, if you ran a dispensary,
you would be the people that wrote 29.1 on
[SPEAKER_03]: the jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just because that's what a
dispensary would do.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as honest people, you'd probably
explain to your friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: It tested these two numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was very happy with those numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that speaks to your breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I say that because I know there are
things in my environment that I can
[SPEAKER_02]: improve.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are two or three things in my mind
that I know I'm going to do down the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to share what those ideas are?
[SPEAKER_02]: CO2 is the first one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, in your opinion,
adding CO2, I know it adds to your yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it can have an impact on THC
levels?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I was talking about earlier,
more surface area, more trichomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have more space, you can add
more trichomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would hope so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a friend from Texas who would argue
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think you're going to get more
trichomes per surface area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's my biggest weakness right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I need to add some CO2 to
grow.
All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that legal where you are?
[SPEAKER_03]: Some places, CO2 argument.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't want to bring a
tank in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would use one of the lesser effective
options.
[SPEAKER_02]: But every little bit helps.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be safe and stealth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, you brought up safety.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to talk about that real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Living in a multi-unit complex,
in an apartment complex, it was never
[SPEAKER_02]: using HPS for the beginner growers out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: HPS puts off a huge amount of heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: My LED light, at any point in time,
I can go up and put my hand on it and keep
[SPEAKER_02]: my hand on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I was trying to figure out how I,
when I was designing my grow, it was never
[SPEAKER_02]: an option for me to run HPS.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if that light falls and it burns
the house, it's not just me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just me and my family.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our five neighbors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think whenever you are in a
multi-unit complex, your decision on your
[SPEAKER_02]: lighting becomes a little more
complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the way I was thinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, not everybody thinks that
way, but they should.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would also help in regards to
regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: There needs to be some education out there
that just because you grow, you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily have a fire hazard.
[SPEAKER_02]: There definitely needs to be some
education with our politicians,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's going to be the next step in
this movement.
[SPEAKER_03]: In some counties, they're actually making
home inspections.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you plan to grow at all, you must pass
a home inspection.
[SPEAKER_03]: You must be up to code.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to pass an electrical inspection.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to show them your grow and they
have to be able to come inspect it
[SPEAKER_03]: whenever they want.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's coming in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: That will be statewide eventually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could definitely see some of those
jurisdictions requiring LED.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we're pulling a lot of power.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't have some sort of
upgrade, you just try to plug in
[SPEAKER_03]: 4,000-watt lights in a home, you're going
to catch something on fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's loop back.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were talking about the genetics and how
you think just improving your grow would
[SPEAKER_03]: make it a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think you did a great job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of improvement may bring you
up a percentage or two, but I think you
[SPEAKER_03]: did a great job for what you've got.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are impressive lab tests.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything over like 22 or 24% is a great
lab test, honestly.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you start hitting the 28s and 29s,
you can start doing cartwheels.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are great.
[SPEAKER_03]: The highest I've ever seen is 35,
and that was a rise.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was grown by our friends at
Organica in New Mexico and tested at Steep
[SPEAKER_03]: Hill.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's as high as you're going to see
so far.
Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It exceeded our expectations.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you did a really good job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I could tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We contacted you like immediately.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I got those screenshots, I was like,
oh, I can kind of read those.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can kind of read them.
We know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw you on live that night,
and you threw out there, or you asked
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone to give you test results if they
had them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had already talked about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did these start a line?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like a day or two of each other,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you can say this cannabis is really
good, but if you can put on your website,
[SPEAKER_03]: tested at 29%, that just looks really good
for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then to have the test results from
people from reputable labs, and I can show
[SPEAKER_03]: them screenshots of the test results.
[SPEAKER_03]: That definitely makes some reputation and
some credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: My next step is to get terpene testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that would be fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: How much does a terpene test cost,
just out of curiosity?
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I knew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, testing is becoming more grower
friendly, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of testing facilities,
you have to be licensed for.
You have to be MED.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be MED.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went to a GROW symposium last year,
and Jeremy won a drawing to have all of
[SPEAKER_00]: our stuff tested, and then we couldn't do
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, because you're not MED regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we just saw that girl of that company,
and she said they're changing that this
[SPEAKER_00]: year within their company.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as time passes, there are more options
for home growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ways to have things done.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we talked about Firefly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk more about Firefly,
because I'm still doing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I almost abandoned this whole strain list
thing, the strain review thing we're
[SPEAKER_03]: doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long did you let them flower?
[SPEAKER_02]: 63 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I would have recommended.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're done.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you did it just right on 63 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys, if you're doing Firefly,
63 days is the hot ticket right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those two, the gas and the limiting
one, those were harvested on December
[SPEAKER_00]: 18th.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they've been curing up.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You telling her to talk on the mic?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just right on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just barely loud enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just laughing because we're still
calling it the gassy week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We decided it was cheese.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could still be the gassy week.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cheesy gassy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the gassy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cheesy gassy one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you smell the cheese in there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you smell that short cheddar?
I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to change the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little tilamot cow on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was there anything that you noticed,
any random details that you'd like to
[SPEAKER_03]: mention about the grow?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was one wonky?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was there a mutant in there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did one grow 22 leaves?
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed that I got a little bit more
yellowing of the leaves than I never could
[SPEAKER_02]: completely wrap my hands around.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the buds look so great that I never
lost sleep about it.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: At first I thought maybe it needed more
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was over watering.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew that my runoff pH was dialed in,
so there weren't any nutrient locks.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think she probably wanted more nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: She likes to eat.
[SPEAKER_03]: More nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's hungry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will say on that second grow or the
second cycle, I put more earthworm
[SPEAKER_02]: castings towards the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: That speed her up a little, help her out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that helped slow the fading of
the leaves down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would explain the nitrogen
deficiency.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything pollinated by a rise is going to
grow fast and probably want more
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say be aggressive on the
nitrogen because I felt like I was pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: aggressive and she could have used more
maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well feed her aggressively then.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty much on all of them,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That we saw that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like pretty equal.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the most part.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean some phenos had maybe a little bit
more yellowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a few days before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you smoked any of them yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that first one, we saved that big
nug for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was all of our friends' very
favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I wanted to bring out something to you
about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we've gone through these grows,
you know, the scents and the aromas change
[SPEAKER_00]: from like the very beginning in the flower
until the end, until the harvest while
[SPEAKER_00]: you're drying, then you cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: In two weeks, it can change, you know,
aromas, I feel like three times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not a fan of the first firefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, this is not fruity or citrusy
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is earthy, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of our friends would come
over and that's the first one everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: would want to that shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it wasn't until after it cured that I
opened it one day, you know, because you
[SPEAKER_00]: burped them throughout.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I opened it one day and Jeremy and I
were like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, game changer right then.
[SPEAKER_00]: After it cured, it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was not a fan up until up until that
moment for that particular one.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you look at the two phenotypes,
that was the big difference is the lemon
[SPEAKER_02]: came on, the lemon smell came on during
the cure in the later phases of the cure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas the other one I smelled when I
unzipped the tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I had to check myself and
quit being so prejudgmental.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cure it and then smoke it.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's usually the opposite.
[SPEAKER_03]: I usually find I love the smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: I dry it and cure it and I go,
oh, where did that smell come from?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm glad that you brought out the good
smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely an improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So have you smoked the other two or you
only smoked the one?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we haven't.
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of buzz did the one that you did
smoke give you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Were you like lazy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Were you energetic?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it was absolutely a sativa high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely a sativa high.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, of our entire stash at the
moment, I anytime I was going for a strong
[SPEAKER_02]: sativa, that was my go to.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't even have to put thought into it.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So get you creative, get you moving,
get the dishes done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Forget where you left your keys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to step away for a sec and I'm
going to grab one of those bongs off the
[SPEAKER_00]: shelf and I'm going to prepare it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, let's sesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give me just one moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we allowed to smoke in here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we've been taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I just know that some places
consider dabbing vaping, so I didn't know
[SPEAKER_03]: if there was a distinction to be made.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if this is part of the
business because we're upstairs.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another door.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's a bong, I bet you can smoke out
of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I wouldn't have a bong if you can't
smoke out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, this facility, I just want to say
real quick, guys, Cheryl and I came in
[SPEAKER_02]: town yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't know anybody and we just chose
one of the only two social smoking clubs
[SPEAKER_02]: here in town.
[SPEAKER_02]: Walked in, not many people here,
started talking to the girl behind the bar
[SPEAKER_02]: that was making us coffee and come find
out she was the owner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the coolest, coolest girl in the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was very welcoming to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And within an hour of talking to her,
I got permission to do this show up here
[SPEAKER_02]: in the upstairs area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just want to say thank you again.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just she didn't know us from
anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just walked in off the street.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she offered the space to us without
knowing anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty kind of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was very nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just to give them an official shout
out, we are at the original cannabis club,
[SPEAKER_03]: Studio A64 in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are located at 332 East Colorado
Avenue.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's at Colorado and Wasatch.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's plenty of parking.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easy to get to.
[SPEAKER_03]: They check your ID at the door.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're super friendly, super polite.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get the crepes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeremy just nodded like, yeah,
bro, get the crepes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Miss Jenny Beth had her birthday party
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a little smoke out and the crepes,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: The crepes were amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the stoners enjoyed the crepes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I only ate a little bit and I wanted more.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had a smoothie yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, it's made with real fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it was very hearty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the crepes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might have to go downstairs in a minute
and get some crepes when we're done with
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, she took off.
[SPEAKER_03]: She just vanished into the other end of
the nether regions.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's gone now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll never see her again.
[SPEAKER_03]: She may have gotten permission for us to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that's where she's going.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you want to move forward from the
strain?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, 63 days to grow it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, if you're growing Firefly,
it may get kind of tall on you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to stretch because it is a
sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: The lemon skunk is stretchy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Solomon was a stretchy dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're going to get some tall stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be ready for some bamboo stakes or some
tomato cages or scrog that bitch out.
[SPEAKER_03]: She loves being spread out real far.
[SPEAKER_03]: Top her, spread her out.
[SPEAKER_03]: She will really like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yield expectations.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to get good, happy yields.
[SPEAKER_03]: Firefly, she does put out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about feed tips.
[SPEAKER_03]: Feed her heavily.
[SPEAKER_03]: She needs a little more nutrients than
usual because she gets so big.
[SPEAKER_03]: She likes to grow fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: She'll take off on you, give her a lot of
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: pH about six, four, just like everything
else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Phenotypes to expect.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one with the serrated leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: The leaf tips will turn up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be super lemony flavored.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bigger leaves, the more toward
daybreaker you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_03]: The skinnier leaves, the more toward
golden goat and lemon skunk you're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to get.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the skinnier leaf phenotypes,
but they get taller.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get skinnier and they grow faster,
but that's where it's at for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's where the THC comes in.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are available at the Hella Dank Seed
Bank.
[SPEAKER_03]: So make sure you check them out at
dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'll correct that if I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check them out at the Hella Dank Seed
Bank.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let them know Ross Dejef sent you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think that's going to wrap up the
little strain review for Firefly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, thank you for growing the shit
out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smells good.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's got a bong with fresh, clean water.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for giving it to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll leave with some more stuff so that
we can do this again in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I've got 14 or 15 different
varieties with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll let you pick something out of there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring it on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring it on, he said.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which would you like to try first?
[SPEAKER_03]: You just put me on the spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oddly enough, I kind of want to taste that
cheesy one.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will load that up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a little, what's the person that
comes and handles the wine for you?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to weave one of those now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys said something earlier that
we've talked about a lot of things,
[SPEAKER_03]: but one of the things you said just out of
conversation really stuck with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never thought of things this way,
which makes me think that a lot of other
[SPEAKER_03]: people probably never thought of it this
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: You made a statement that we didn't,
I should mention you guys are from another
[SPEAKER_03]: state.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys left Arkansas because it wasn't
so cannabis friendly.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was an incident that maybe you might
want to touch on after we smoke a bowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to force anything out of
you, but you had a discrimination incident
[SPEAKER_03]: and you guys realized Arkansas sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to get out of here and go to
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you said not all people are coming
here just to get high.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're coming here just to get away and
be free because Arkansas and the other
[SPEAKER_03]: places that people are coming from aren't
very friendly and aren't very fun to be
[SPEAKER_03]: in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe we need to, I and the people in
Colorado, we should be a little more
[SPEAKER_03]: friendly because they're not coming here
just to get high.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a bonus.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cool here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also the other side, it just sucks
where they're coming from.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't want to be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're discriminated against.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are pulled over and harassed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you could just move to another
state and not face that, why wouldn't you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I tell everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I hear that phrase that people move
to Colorado to get high, we can get high
[SPEAKER_02]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get weed anywhere in any 50 of
these states.
[SPEAKER_00]: In all the countries we've ever visited.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pretty decent selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just about getting high.
[SPEAKER_02]: For us, it was about freedom and not being
locked in a cage like an animal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're very passionate about that
because we had some incidents with K-9
[SPEAKER_02]: units.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it definitely made us appreciate
our freedom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we wanted to secure that freedom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we knew if we wanted to secure that
freedom, we had to get out of that state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the process, we are the advocates
that we are now and here to help other
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to touch on the story you told
at all?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or would we just rather leave it at that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to smoke this first?
[SPEAKER_03]: How about I'll take a bonk hit while you
tell your story?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a torch.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just use the torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we each have our own harassment
story, if you will, that both affected our
[SPEAKER_00]: livelihoods, career, college, different
things that have happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, it's happened to a lot of
people that we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know where we're from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll just share that I was a public
school teacher for eight years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was a department head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was very, very heavily involved with
my school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to get emotional talking
about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Skip anything you don't want to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're uncomfortable, we could skip
right over it, I promise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like people need to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm OK with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just told you about it earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just like I like to smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes me a better person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use it for medicine for very
different reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one day, I left school on an
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I pulled out in front of someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that person honked at me, but they
weren't going to hit me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we kept driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was being followed by an unmarked
canine unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was pulled over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I rolled my window down,
it's kind of like just when the harassment
[SPEAKER_00]: started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he asked me when was the last time I
had smoked marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just kind of laughed.
[SPEAKER_03]: From the moment the window came down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to say that this happens on a
daily basis where we're from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I never thought it would happen to me,
especially in the situation and timing
[SPEAKER_00]: that it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just kind of laughed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, I can smell marijuana when
you roll down your window.
[SPEAKER_00]: And can I search your car?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, no, you may not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time, I didn't know that he
had the authority above me to search my
[SPEAKER_00]: car anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a Supreme Court ruling several
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were pulled over by canine units,
they have the authority to search your
[SPEAKER_00]: vehicle against your consent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, just to clarify that, if the dog,
quote unquote, hits on your car,
[SPEAKER_02]: they have the legal right to search your
vehicle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we all know how easy it is to make a
dog do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're not allowed to know what that
hit looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they don't really have to prove
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically right now, I could be the dog
and I'm hitting on your car, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Could that have been the hit?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't do anything, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't do shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just sat here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
I was still.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is the hit when they're quiet or is it
when they're barking loud or whatever it
[SPEAKER_00]: may be?
[SPEAKER_03]: To move his left paw right to this
direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he searched my car twice, called up for
backup.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went through my car, dumped everything
out, went through my driver's manual,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's where I would keep my
drugs, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he found my school badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he knows who I worked for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had to let me go because I was
innocent.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was nothing in my car.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no smell in my car.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that until the day that I died.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no reason for him to harass me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a brand new car.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never even smoked in my car.
[SPEAKER_03]: You do not look like a drug user.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying to be discriminatory.
[SPEAKER_03]: You look healthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't show any of the signs of drug
use.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your eyes aren't red.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't even tell right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know how many people have told me
that my whole life?
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't even know if I'm high because
my eyes do not turn red.
[SPEAKER_03]: In school, you would have been one of the
girls that would have been like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if she should know I'm
smoking at lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if she's supposed to know
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've gotten that from other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, like I said, so they had to let me
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was on a Friday afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I thought I was fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he had to let me go, he did not
give me a citation, not a warning,
[SPEAKER_00]: a ticket or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought I was okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to school on Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I serve as two schools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And apparently this officer had written a
report to this two school resource
[SPEAKER_00]: officers of the two schools that I worked
at who then reported in it to my
[SPEAKER_00]: principals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Reported that he pulled you over,
harassed you and found nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was not cited.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't let me read the report.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at that point, doesn't the officer get
in the car and go, dispatch, I ain't found
[SPEAKER_03]: shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's going home.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go fuck with someone else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that the end?
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that the end of that story?
[SPEAKER_00]: You would think.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to wrap your mind around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Around, I need to go tell that these other
cops that I didn't find anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: These other cops need to tell other people
that nobody found anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just going to walk beside me every
day, talk to me, look at my, go check out
[SPEAKER_00]: my car in the parking lot just to figure
out if, you know, like what's going on or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at 10 o'clock Monday morning,
I was called in to a meeting with the
[SPEAKER_00]: principals from both schools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they told me about this report.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I worked for a state agency,
I did not know this at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had the legality to investigate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you worked for an employer that's not
the state, then they don't have that
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they questioned me and bullied me and
harassed me and grabbed my arm across the
[SPEAKER_00]: table and asked me if I was okay,
if I needed help.
[SPEAKER_03]: You grabbed my arm when you were telling
me the story earlier and grabbed me to
[SPEAKER_03]: explain how hard they grabbed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's assault.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They assaulted you.
[SPEAKER_03]: They intimidated you.
[SPEAKER_03]: They bullied you.
[SPEAKER_03]: They tried all kinds of terrible shit
against you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I broke down and then I just kind of
went crazy for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'd like to give Cheryl credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: She, you know, bullying is a hot topic in
our public schools as it should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were absolutely bullying her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, from the moment she got pulled over,
she was bullying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and I told them that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, she called them out on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what we, what we try to teach
our students is what you not to do is what
[SPEAKER_02]: you are doing to me right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hypocrisy is enormous.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're profiling you, like you are a
five foot something average weight white
[SPEAKER_03]: girl.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're profiling you.
[SPEAKER_03]: In a new car.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're dressed well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you look clean, you got a new
jacket, like your shoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't look like maybe I'm profiling
drug users or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have any of the signs of
somebody that the cops need to fuck with
[SPEAKER_03]: for drug use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where it's like where we're
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who else are they profiling?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you are able, you are educated and
articulate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And happen to be lucky enough to have
white privilege and they're fucking with
[SPEAKER_03]: you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine what they're doing to the
impoverished people that aren't dressed as
[SPEAKER_03]: well as you, that don't have the mindset
that you do to defend yourself mentally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine what's happening to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can drive, you can drive around
this town and just like many other town,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's not a small town.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is, you know, pretty fairly
developed area.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is happening all over and it is this
guy's sole job to drive around with this
[SPEAKER_02]: K9 unit all day long and harass people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this one town has two officers that do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's their only responsibility is to drive
around town.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had just been voted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see it, especially after her
incident, we would be driving around.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like, oh gosh.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we, you know, we would have those
flashbacks.
[SPEAKER_02]: There he is ruining someone else's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were graded number one school
district in the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were rated number one safest city
in the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is going on, on the reg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then, you know, so, so back to the
meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I start telling them that they're
bullies and how ridiculous this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, one principal is like,
I have never noticed you under the
[SPEAKER_00]: influence anything at school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, yeah, you fucking
shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never brought anything onto this
campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even admit to anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had nothing to deny or admit to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They couldn't drug test me either.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had, you know, no basis to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now, you know, we got on, we got on
this story.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just a good reminder for everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what we, this is what the cannabis
refugees escape.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's every single day this is
going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, it's not just about getting
high.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is about escaping harassment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then after that meeting,
like it was the one principal just ended
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One prince, the other principal,
he never spoke to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ever again, up until the day I moved,
he never said another word to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other principal, he spoke to me every
day after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both school resource officers spoke to
me every single day after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them, I didn't even know if he
knew my name and he spoke to me every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know they went out there with my car
when we weren't looking because they'll go
[SPEAKER_00]: out there and look at teachers cars and
then email.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be issuing citations for expired
tags, you know, be sure to check your tags
[SPEAKER_00]: to see if they're expiring this month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, ridiculous shit like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Police day backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Police day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is fucking real in the South.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what we were kind of dealing
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I didn't, I, you know, I just,
the paranoia just was intense at that
[SPEAKER_00]: moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just decided this is not well for
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say like Jeremy and I were,
we were wanting to move anyway,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this just kind of ignited it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it was, yeah, that, I guess that
moment, that night that I went home ended
[SPEAKER_00]: up being one of the greatest moments for
our future, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sped us up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And life is completely different now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys happy you're here now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, do you remember 40 minutes ago when
you're like, Oh no, I'm not going to talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to be on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here I am telling you my innermost
secrets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how passionate it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't get Southern until you tell that
story.
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, Oh, there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I got emotional there for a
second and now I'm okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, wow, I can breathe all of a
sudden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That feels good.
[SPEAKER_00]: To share it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it really does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I hope that there's a
big evolution and change in our public
[SPEAKER_00]: school systems and education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Educating our students and just teachers
as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say we have to educate the
adults.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the kids are catching on.
[SPEAKER_03]: They see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They will.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The TV is teaching the kids that weed's
cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Social media.
[SPEAKER_03]: The adults are the ones that we have to
reprogram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like my grandparents were taught that weed
was the devil.
[SPEAKER_03]: That if white people smoke weed,
you'll be raping white bitches.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're going to be like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my grandparents, fortunately enough,
they were pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were, they were down, but I'm sure
they had friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were like, you shouldn't be smoking
that devil weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's, but that's what the
generation was taught then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the hippies were like,
no, we're going to smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all the hippies kids, that's me.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and I'm like, yeah, I just
smoked weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I saw my parents do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now my daughter's generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure that's, you know, they're all
going to be a bunch of potheads because
[SPEAKER_03]: they can go to the store and get it now.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have to go to some weird dude's
house and watch them feed his iguana for
[SPEAKER_03]: an hour to buy a bag of weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how it used to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how it used to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to say that if I did not have to go
to my drug dealer's house to buy weed,
[SPEAKER_03]: I never would have bought LSD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if I was going to a dispensary
where they only sold marijuana,
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have only known about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: But my weed dealer was like, I have acid
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, sounds fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me a couple of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just how it went.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only reason it's a gateway
drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I smoked some bong hits of the cheesy
firefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I want to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took two big bong rips.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure how much is left after I hit
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll reload it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what were your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's spicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: In a good way.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is cheesy and it is funky, but it
definitely went straight to my eyes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like my body didn't get high from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't feel much head change,
but I got like, when you get that stone in
[SPEAKER_03]: your eyes, like, whoa, like I got eye high
from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: My eyelids got real heavy, not tired,
but like I call it an eye high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I dig that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dabs don't have eye high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever is in cannabis, we're not passing
that along to the dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, your eyes, you've taken as many dabs
as myself and now a bong hit and your eyes
[SPEAKER_03]: don't seem to get red at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my hidden talent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It saves on eye drops.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be driving to work and rubbing my
bottle of eye drops between my hands
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's fucking winter and they're
frozen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, ah, come on, I just got to get my
eyes widened up for the drive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just trying to sit on the eye drops and
put them on the heater vent or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to reload this real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: We aren't prepared to smoke flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have all of these.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we did not bring the equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need an ashtray and a little poker and
she's got everything spread across the
[SPEAKER_03]: room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so where do we want to go from here?
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got some notes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have we not covered anything on your
notes?
[SPEAKER_02]: We pretty much covered everything on the,
on the, uh, growing in small environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just say anyone who has questions
about, um, if anyone wants me to help
[SPEAKER_02]: them, I'm far from an expert on growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I still consider myself a fairly
new grower, but if you have challenges in
[SPEAKER_02]: tiny spaces, um, you know, there's so much
knowledge out there on YouTube,
[SPEAKER_02]: of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most people are, are already there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need me to tell you that,
but reach out to me on love for the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've helped multiple people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, in fact, there, there are,
there are a couple of people that have the
[SPEAKER_02]: exact same setup as mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: They modeled, modeled it after mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's been fun to actually see that play
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't it fun getting people going and
seeing the progress that people make and
[SPEAKER_03]: you feel a little like, ah, my,
my stepping stones.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got them that far.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's also a reminder how small
environmental differences can make a big
[SPEAKER_02]: difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're in a different state and
they're like, dude, I have the exact same
[SPEAKER_02]: setup as you, but, you know, I'm having
these hit issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't keep it cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't keep the humidity down,
but it's all manageable.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're waiting for your review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a big green hit for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you found the lighter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went at it with the torch.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I roasted the whole bowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, definitely funky funk funk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's some funk, but a good funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually, um, the aftertaste I like
even better than the smell on that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll, it'll creep up on you too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll get, uh, it'll get different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess because I had told you,
like, I tend to not be a fan of the Kims
[SPEAKER_00]: or the diesels or the gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that tastes even better than I expected
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's the cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's the cheese and I love cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you think just now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, definitely the eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes straight to the eyes, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just went straight to my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it does.
[SPEAKER_03]: So make sure you follow these guys on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, they post great photos.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, these obviously got a lot of knowledge
on small space grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're looking for information on
small space grows, you want someone to
[SPEAKER_03]: interact with or share your grow with,
uh, they have great conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, they're great people to talk to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure you could tell by the podcast,
but they're as friendly on social media as
[SPEAKER_03]: they are in person.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have some conversations.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure he'll share all of his knowledge
with you about small grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just follow them either way,
uh, at love for the plant on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_03]: check out their grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we've got plenty of time to ramble.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we've covered all of the notes.
[SPEAKER_03]: What, uh, you guys want to chat about
anything you'd like to say since you've
[SPEAKER_03]: got a microphone in your hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I told you how many people listen,
but I'm not going to remind you because I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't want to make you nervous.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I just wanted to give a shout out to
normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and not only just normal, but any,
or any pro cannabis organization like
[SPEAKER_02]: them, these people are spending time up at
the Capitol talking to politicians,
[SPEAKER_02]: educating them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understand that some of these
organizations may not perfectly align with
[SPEAKER_02]: everything that, um, you believe,
but it's very important that we stay
[SPEAKER_02]: united, especially in light of the Jeff
sessions news.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we really need to unite and don't let
small differences, um, break our unity.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really need to support find an
organization to support whichever one you
[SPEAKER_02]: want.
[SPEAKER_02]: We choose normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we go, you know, they have an annual
fundraiser.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just went to their fundraiser before
Christmas.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: What an amazing event, but it could be so
much better if more people would come out.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that's just one example,
but get involved one way or another.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to go talk to politicians
yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make a small donation to one of these
organizations because they're,
[SPEAKER_02]: they are using that money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, we probably wouldn't be
sitting here where we are right now
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about cannabis on an, on an Apple
product in a social smoking environment,
[SPEAKER_02]: without some of these organizations,
we have to remember that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't, don't throw them out because you
disagree with them on one topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are where we are because of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I was going to say, um, even if
there's not an organization that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: attend regular meetings, like we have the
luxury to do, but even, um, just being
[SPEAKER_00]: more involved in what's going on in your
city.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike would teach you that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is normal the oldest, uh, cannabis
activism, uh, group, or was there somebody
[SPEAKER_03]: before normal?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normal started in the seventies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Tommy Chong is, or Cheech is wearing
a normal shirt in nice dreams.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's how far normal grows.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was the seventies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Support normal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, uh, the national organization for
the reform of marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's normal without the A, if you're going
to Google it, if you're going to search
[SPEAKER_03]: for it, uh, support something,
support cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, of course, I always ask you to support
the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've already done that, uh,
support normal or your favorite cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: activism group.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I, Mike White hit,
um, white Mike, sorry for messing up your
[SPEAKER_02]: name and cracker Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cracker Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, I think he's mentioned it
before, but some of the people that are
[SPEAKER_02]: against us, they are very active and
they're very motivated and they are
[SPEAKER_02]: getting out there and they're,
they are, they hate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They hate cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you guys said a couple of podcasts
ago, they hate cannabis is like,
[SPEAKER_02]: we hate cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they, they have a very strong
agenda and we need, if you are not willing
[SPEAKER_02]: to do that, you need to support an
organization that is willing to do that
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's what we're up against.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Vote.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, vote.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many people say my vote doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go vote and see if it does, especially
even on a small city level.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the city is smaller, your vote matters
even more.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there are only six people to vote,
and then I can convince four people of
[SPEAKER_03]: anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a big mouth and I'm persuasive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can get four people to do whatever the
fuck I want.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other two, fuck them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I only need four.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was serious, but okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Jeremy said, we have to unite as a
cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I know a lot of people want to move
here because it's freedom, but if you can,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you were, if you have the white mic
type of mentality, if you have the
[SPEAKER_03]: activist type of mentality, if you were
outspoken, do what you can do to help us
[SPEAKER_03]: legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, maybe you have a different type of
cannabis podcast you want to put out
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause this should not be the only cannabis
podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't feel like I have the only platform
for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: There should be more help us speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can go speak with politicians and
educate them on cannabis, go do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can teach anybody about cannabis,
do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have an illegal state and you can
work toward legalization there,
[SPEAKER_03]: do it in the way that you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a musician and you're in a band,
write a song about legalizing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're, I said cannabis, that's the
fucking the website.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are an artist, paint something
about legalizing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a poet, write a, I think I made
my point, do something, do your part,
[SPEAKER_03]: find your niche, fill the, fill the void,
help us legalize cannabis everywhere so
[SPEAKER_03]: that people don't have to leave their home
states so that teachers don't have to be
[SPEAKER_03]: harassed by cops.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a hundred pound woman.
[SPEAKER_03]: You shouldn't be harassed by grown ass men
for nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's gotta be intimidating.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a big dude and two cops scare me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can only imagine what it'd be like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you're basically defenseless when two
dudes come around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like two dudes and you lose.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a big German shepherd.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a big German shepherd.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck that dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to get bitten.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm scared.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can only imagine what, what it would
be like to be you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got to remember people don't want
to leave their homes.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to have to go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm comfortable.
[SPEAKER_03]: My stuff is there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It moving sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd rather live in a shelter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shitty house looking for another job.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: No fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: So fight for legalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys support something.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't agree with normal,
uh, if you, if you were educated enough to
[SPEAKER_03]: have made a decision that you don't agree
with normal, you probably have found an
[SPEAKER_03]: organization that you do support.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have done that much research and
you're against normal, that you've
[SPEAKER_03]: probably picked a team contribute to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have to be normal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be ASA.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be whoever could be local.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be national.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be state.
[SPEAKER_03]: Help us out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please find your niche, play the song,
paint the painting, write the poem,
[SPEAKER_03]: dance the dance, put something on your
race car.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get together and legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, you guys, I want to thank you
once again for joining me for a podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we've gone for over an hour now
and it's been nothing but greatness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we are going to smoke the other two
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We may not do it on the show, but we're
going to do that before we leave here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank you once again for this
delicious concentrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have to take more dabs of
that before we go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I like directing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to wrap up the show by giving
a shout out to people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you guys have anyone you would like to
give a shout out to before we wrap up the
[SPEAKER_03]: podcast?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can both get one.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to agree on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, for me, it's the obvious.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mom, she was supportive of us.
Really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of our moms are very supportive of us
moving out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, it's not easy moving away from
family.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but they've been fully supportive in
regards to both of us, both us moving and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything cannabis related that we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to give a shout out to all of
our local Colorado family, like you
[SPEAKER_00]: included in the other growers that growers
that we've met.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really put ourselves out there with
meetups and you know, trying to build that
[SPEAKER_00]: community and become part of that
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we couldn't even be sitting here
right there, you know, like today,
[SPEAKER_00]: right now without that event last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you to all of the people that
we've met.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like that's a great way to wrap up
this part of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy session.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy session.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to smoke
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to wrap up this portion of the
show and I will be back to put a bow on
