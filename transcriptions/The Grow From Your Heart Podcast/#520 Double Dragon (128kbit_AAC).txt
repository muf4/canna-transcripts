[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Malibu
Pure Kush Ambrosia from Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, it says the product
contains 72.9% THC and 84.7% total
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about the Malibu Pure Kush on
the last episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love the flavor, the aroma,
and of course, I love the buzz from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my friends at
Apothecary Farms for the delicious Malibu
Pure Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to do a strain
feature on my strain double dragon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let's do some shout
outs to a few of the folks who support the
[SPEAKER_00]: show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off by rolling up a big fat
joint, lighten it up, and pass it over to
[SPEAKER_00]: Miss Mel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to roll a big fat joint,
light that fucker up, and pass it over to
[SPEAKER_00]: my friend, the corporate rebel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I want to pack a big fresh bong load
and pass that fucker over to my buddy Bong
[SPEAKER_00]: Breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's roll a big fat blunt and put a
snake of shatter down the middle of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: light that up, and pass it over to my
buddy Bafsta.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, let's get too big of a dab and
heat up a dab nail and pass that fucker
[SPEAKER_00]: over to my buddy Stabby McStabwood and
watch him cough for a couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Stabby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's smoke some really good high
quality rosin with my buddy Ned Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's roll up a big fat joint and
maybe sprinkle some keif down the middle
[SPEAKER_00]: of it and light that up and pass it over
to my buddy Redbeard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I want to roll a king size joint of
this super dankest weed, light that up,
[SPEAKER_00]: and pass it over to my brand new friend,
Mr. Paparoni.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's get crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's roll up a blunt and wrap a snake of
shatter around the outside of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe put a little bit of keif down the
middle of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light that fucker up and let's pass it
over to my new friend, Dayron T.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks, big shout out, big smokey high
fives and fist bumps to everybody who
[SPEAKER_00]: supports the show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to learn how to support

[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need to support
the show will be right there on the screen
[SPEAKER_00]: and I did include a link in the show notes
and the video description for my stoner
[SPEAKER_00]: friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
I did say that I was going to do a strain
[SPEAKER_00]: feature on Double Dragon, so let's jump
right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is Double Dragon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Double Dragon is a cross of my Arise male
crossed to a Durban poison female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk briefly about my Arise male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise is a Golden Goat to Daybreaker
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat has a really sweet tropical
sort of a flavor, kind of a sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant head buzz to that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on the other side, we've got the
Daybreaker that is Chem Deed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got Chem Dog aromas, we've got OG
Kush aromas, it's got funk to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's got Kush, it's got gas, it's got
fuel, it's got some odd funky aromas which
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes gigantic leaves and it's got that
more punch you in the face, sit you down
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by crossing the Golden Goat and the
Daybreaker, there was a lot of contrast in
[SPEAKER_00]: those two plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew I could make a really vigorous and
a really new hybrid, so I crossed those.
[SPEAKER_00]: That creation was known as Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a full episode about Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you search grow from your heart Arise,
it will pop up very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check that episode out, learn all about
Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: The male that I used in this cross for
Double Dragon was a specially selected
[SPEAKER_00]: male Arise plant who has been called King
Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: King Solomon has made many, many
successful crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything he touches, he puts more resin
on the outcome, he puts more vigor into
[SPEAKER_00]: the outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: King Solomon has become known as the plant
fixer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a female plant that grows
well but it's got a problem, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: probably pollinate it with King Solomon
and we will fix it and make that plant the
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring will be even better than both
plants which is the goal in breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So King Solomon passes on high THC and
great potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also passes on hyper vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also passes on a very nice structure
and he also gives very good resistance to
[SPEAKER_00]: mold and mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a great male plant to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the other side of
this cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: The female in this cross I used was a
Durbin poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a Durbin poison cut that travels
through the Colorado commercial grow
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and that is the exact cut that I
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have purchased Durbin poison in
Colorado in the past couple of years,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in the southern Colorado area,
it was probably grown from the exact cut
[SPEAKER_00]: which I am using.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that black licorice, anise smell
to it, a little bit of sweetness depending
[SPEAKER_00]: on what nutrients it's grown with and how
it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it gets a little funkier,
sometimes it gets a little sweeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they do it just right that anise and
licorice smell really, really pops.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you smoke it, it brings out maybe a
hint of mint in the flavor but it stays
[SPEAKER_00]: real anise and licoricey and it's got that
mint sort of an after taste to it and if
[SPEAKER_00]: you do it right, it is such a head ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will rip your head off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed the THC A test don't come out
super high on the Durbin poison but when I
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke it, I get fucking high from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get higher from the Durbin poison than a
lot of other strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed when I smoke the Durbin
poison and also the Double Dragon that my
[SPEAKER_00]: eyes get bloody, bloody red.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does something to my eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like a psychedelic panic
attack sort of a high.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some people, it can be overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds a little unappealing or
unappetizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, that is right where I want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get me right to that level
where I'm like, oh shit, that's how high I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh shit, I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're like, what was I doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where am I?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm smoking for sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get that from the Durbin poison
and you can absolutely get that from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Double Dragon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cross is the female Double Dragon
crossed to the male Arise plant which was
[SPEAKER_00]: known as King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: A moment ago, I called King Solomon the
plant fixer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have got a plant that doesn't grow
the way I want it to or doesn't produce
[SPEAKER_00]: the way I need it to or it's just lacking
in something, maybe it's got all the turps
[SPEAKER_00]: but not the potency, maybe it's got all
the potency and not the turps,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe it grows funny, I can pollinate it
with King Solomon and nine times out of
[SPEAKER_00]: 10, the outcome will be better than both
parent plants and I will do what I have
[SPEAKER_00]: called fixing the original plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, I had that Durbin poison cut
and there were a couple of things I did
[SPEAKER_00]: not like about that cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing I didn't like is just the
way that it grew, the structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: the way the plant branched out,
the way it grew sideways, the way it
[SPEAKER_00]: branched out weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't go straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wanted to make viney branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needed a lot of work, a lot of support,
a lot of attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't working well in a commercial
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kept growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could make it work and grow because
people really wanted that Durbin poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a good reputation and it flies off
the shelf so it was worth the pain in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ass grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I knew I could fix it by breeding it
to my King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my main goal was to improve the
structure and shape of that plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: improve the way the branches grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that is just the shape and
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I wanted to fix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to make it a more vigorous plant,
more commercially viable plant is what I
[SPEAKER_00]: think my goal was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that Durbin poison, but in a
commercial environment, it slowed us down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not reach goals because of it,
but it was so amazingly flavorful and
[SPEAKER_00]: potent that we kept it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my main goal was to fix that growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: My second goal was to keep that Durbin
poison flavor and aroma in the cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my third hope was that we would get
that amazing Durbin poison, head ripper
[SPEAKER_00]: buzz, that super slanty eyes, the red
eyes, the amazing cotton mouth,
[SPEAKER_00]: the time travel high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hoping we would get that out of the
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in most phenotypes, I do find that we
get that Durbin poison flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them have that rip and rip and
high and they all grow quite a bit better
[SPEAKER_00]: than that original Durbin poison cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like I did hit my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are more phenotypes than I
anticipated or expected in this breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time I see two or three,
maybe three or four solid phenotypes that
[SPEAKER_00]: I can kind of categorize and identify.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can say, oh, those traits are happening
because of this parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's happening because of this parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see quite a bit of variation in the
double dragon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that this is just the F1
version of the double dragon that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: playing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not made F2s yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be able to lock in phenotypes and
lock in traits as I so desire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have not made that step into the
project yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, I am seeing several
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will discuss the phenotypes in just a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk more about growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, something I find interesting about
some of the phenotypes of this plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: that it wants to get stretchy and grow
horizontally instead of vertically.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants to go out and stretch sideways
and get wider.
So it's going to grow very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of these phenotypes will require
some sort of sticks or netting or tomato
[SPEAKER_00]: cages or something to make it grow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise you will just have a low lying
bush that keeps going out and sideways.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that is what you want, that will work
beautifully for you, but that is not what
[SPEAKER_00]: most cannabis growers are looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doubledore has a phenotype that is quite
stretchy and it kind of moves around a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit branchy, but it works
beautifully for his vertical grow and his
[SPEAKER_00]: trellis style system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So different phenotypes will work
beautifully in different environments,
[SPEAKER_00]: but be prepared because some of them will
get stretchy and they will get a little
[SPEAKER_00]: branchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you put them into flower,
they really will stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 21 day stretch is crazy on this plant,
but you can mitigate that by doing popping
[SPEAKER_00]: and twisting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to pop and twist the branches and
crunch them up during the first three
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks of flower that really slows down
that lateral growth and it will not put
[SPEAKER_00]: any harm to your flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not building flowers at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is just kicking into flower
mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead, crunch, pop, twist, bend,
work all those stems, give it all those
[SPEAKER_00]: knuckles, make it nice and tough,
but keep it nice and low so that it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't grow too tall too quickly because
it does want to take off on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know I say this about almost every
strain that I put out, but you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: need some sort of supports.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need to lift the plant up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's going to get giant buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that comes from Solomon makes
pretty large buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Durban poison plant made fairly large
buds from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are going to see potentially
gigantic buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be prepared, have some sticks,
have an extra trellis net, have some way
[SPEAKER_00]: to support those giant buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to walk in there on week
five and find out that one of those big
[SPEAKER_00]: ass branches snapped because your colas
were so damn big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these plants are going to grow quickly
in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will grow very quickly in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have noticed that these plants like a
little bit less water than most plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed that if I water one gallon
every day on all of my other plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the double dragon plants can probably
take half to three quarters of a gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be phenotype specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be environment specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just give your plants less water
because I said it may work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may notice that some of your double
dragon plants don't drink as much and as
[SPEAKER_00]: often as many of your other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, they tend to like a little bit of a
higher temperature and a drier
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that is coming from the
Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes from an African region where it
is hot and dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also probably have less water in the
region where this plant originates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant wants less water,
a warmer and drier environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have also noticed that some phenotypes
of the double dragon will tolerate and
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly enjoy a higher pH than some of
the other plants in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are noticing issues with these
plants and you think they're not uptaking
[SPEAKER_00]: their food properly, you may need to
increase the pH of your feeding solution
[SPEAKER_00]: and that may help with your double dragon
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I should mention that double dragon is
kind of a picky plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the phenotypes can be a little bit
finicky.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thinner-leaved phenotypes are the more
problematic plants is what I have noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are harder to diagnose when they do
fuck up and they are more prone to having
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that comes from the golden
goat because golden goat is always macro
[SPEAKER_00]: deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that comes from the Durban
poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's just those two
genetics going, hey, we're from completely
[SPEAKER_00]: different parts of the fucking world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to make us happy in a
commercial cultivation environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not sure what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be from the golden goat,
always being macro deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you're growing golden goat,
if you're growing golden goat crosses,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're growing a rise crosses,
there's a good likelihood that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to find macro nutrient deficiencies
early in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is probably coming from the hyper
vigor of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just using all of the nutrients so
they need a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I should mention that some of the
phenotypes that come from double dragon
[SPEAKER_00]: can be a real pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a plant that I would recommend
for beginning growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more for an advanced grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a longer flowering plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have nine to 10,
maybe even 11 week finishing phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most phenotypes are going to finish around
week nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will finish around week 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are going to have longer finishing
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't discredit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be outliers that take 11 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, those longer flowering plants,
those skinnier leaf plants, those taller
[SPEAKER_00]: thinner plants, they have that crazy buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will get you psychedelic tripping
high, but also they're kind of a pain in
[SPEAKER_00]: the ass to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend those phenotypes for a more
experienced grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a pack of double dragon and
you're not a grow pro and you do find a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of phenotypes, maybe stick with the
one that grows easier for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe don't torture yourself and set
yourself up for a struggle by picking that
[SPEAKER_00]: super sativa heavy phenotype and trying to
fight that the entire time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe pick one that is easier to grow
because it will still give you a killer
[SPEAKER_00]: killer buzz and they will all have that
amazing flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That feels like a good way to segue into
talking about the flavors of most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll talk about the buzz and also
more specific phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I have found is that most of the
phenotypes carry that sweet, anise,
[SPEAKER_00]: licorice, kind of a minty sort of a
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the phenotypes will have that to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the phenotypes will also have a
sweet tropical sort of a thing happening
[SPEAKER_00]: that comes from the golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really good blend of the golden
goat flavors and also the Durban poison
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also on the exhale, there's this hint
of OG Kush that comes with it that leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of a piney, mint, sweet, funky,
tropical flavor on your mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like a lot of flavors,
but when you smoke it, you'll go,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you get the flavor on the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the flavor as you hold it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you get another flavor as you exhale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you're patient and you let the air
move around, in your mouth, you get an
[SPEAKER_00]: altogether different flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I am able to experience and
enjoy all of these terpenes and aromas and
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors that come from the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I'm able to give you such
intense descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sit here and I taste it like a wine
connoisseur, like a beer nerd.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm over here making funny noises and
smacking my lips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do my best to get the flavors
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I notice a lot of the Durban poison
flavor in many phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them carry that golden goat
sweetness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then some of the phenotypes even have that
funky OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there are outliers that are very OG
Kush dominant in the flavor and aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it feels like the anise and licorice
kind of got pushed right to the very back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just get that Kush and then that
anise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the end, there's a hint of
like a mint leaf at the very end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a lot of good flavors that
come through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of these phenotypes have a punch you
in the face, fucking skyrocket,
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking handicap you for the whole day
kind of a buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can lose my keys when they're in my
hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can lose my sunglasses while I'm wearing
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can drive past my exit on the highway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do all kinds of dumb shit when I
smoke Double Dragon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a really good kind of a time warp,
psychedelic, sort of a fucking oh shit
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, I've said it before on the
show, that's what I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that borderline panic attack that
almost smoked myself into an anxiety
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you can tell if you walk up to
me at ComedyWorks, and I am in the zone
[SPEAKER_00]: for a comedy show, I am right on the edge
of oh shit, because that's how I like to
[SPEAKER_00]: get right before a comedy show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the comedy starts, you settle in,
you just laugh your ass off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talkative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm high as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk more specifically about the
phenotypes that we will find in a pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: Double Dragon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we are going to find the Durban
poison dominant phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one makes pine cone shaped buds,
kind of spear shaped buds, tall,
[SPEAKER_00]: real sativa dominant, real classic sativa
looking plants, nice leaf shapes,
[SPEAKER_00]: nice structure on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them, however, may have that weird
floppy side branchy shit going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, they're going to be
tall, pointy, sharp, spear, pine cone
[SPEAKER_00]: looking buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of them are bright green.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Durban poison dominant phenotypes are
like bright, almost a neon green sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: color.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't get that dark color that the
cushions get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a really nice, noticeable
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got that bright, bright green,
it could be from your nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could be from your lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in comparison, the bright,
bright green is a little more Durban
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, of course, there is the Arise or
Golden Goat dominant phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see more Golden Goat than I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any of the OG Kush, any of the Joseph OG,
any of the Chem D, any of the Daybreaker
[SPEAKER_00]: traits, I find more of the Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get skinnier leaves here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These leaves are skinnier and they kind of
talk a little bit right at the base where
[SPEAKER_00]: the pedial starts to spread off into the
fingers of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look a little bit crinkled,
a little bit taco-y.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is coming from the Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, that plant is going to get macro
deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one is telling you, I'm going to be
macro deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't get as light green as the
Durban phenotype, but it does stay a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit lighter green.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes off growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Golden Goat phenotype really gets
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets kind of tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is the Kushy phenotype,
which I talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't carry as much of the Durban and
the Golden Goat aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stays a little bit shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stays a little bit more squat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, it's not the phenotype I was
hoping to breed out of this project,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's in there and it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it the Kushy phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's squatty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also could come from some of the
Romulan, also from the Golden Goat cross,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think it's more Kushy dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is one that I call the Fist
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes buds that look like little fists
or blockheads.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also called it the Blockhead
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some reason, it doesn't grow pointy
spears.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just grows chunks that look like
sponges hanging off of the stick or a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of fists hanging off of the stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one has a really delicious Durban
poison flavor, a really nice Durban poison
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it brings in some of that Golden Goat
sweetness, but the high is a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more heavier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little bit more indica to it
than all of the other Sativa dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one I call the Blockhead or the Fist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets really frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one will get bigger leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice if you've got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is the one that I call the
Fucking Weirdo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one grows out weird sideways vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows real tall and spindly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost looks like some kind of vine you
would find on the side of the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really unique, but it is so
potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown that one out a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sucks to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no fun, but if you dry it and cure it
and smoke it, your eyes get my eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't talk about yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: My eyes and everybody else I smoked it
with were deadly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was level red.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just went straight to the eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gave me the most intense cotton mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so high that it was weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just like, bro, I haven't been this
fucking high in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know when you're high, you have to
just keep looking at all your friends
[SPEAKER_00]: going, bro, you're as fucking high as me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a serious heavy smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff had everybody looking around
the room going, bro, I'm fucking baked,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are looking at me like,
what'd you put in that weed, man?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, it's just good weed,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that phenotype doesn't put out for
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The harvest weight on that psychedelic
crazy branchy phenotype, it makes tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: little wispy buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fluffy, they're airy, they suck,
but they're coated in resin and it got me
[SPEAKER_00]: so incredibly high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the weirdo phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of stretchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows weird floppy branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants to go sideways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you accidentally bump one of
those branches, they break right off the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what that is a trait from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a strong, strong plant,
but that is one phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't pop up very often.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the fucking weirdo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not in the mix very commonly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've probably seen it two out of a hundred
seeds, so don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably won't get that phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is the Durbin phenome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one is going to take probably nine or
10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the Golden Goat phenome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's going to take you about nine
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cushy phenome and the Fisty phenome
are about nine weekers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That weirdo, she likes to go 10,
maybe a little bit more weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to see the perfect
blend, the goal I was going for.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is the blend of the Durbin poison
that crosses beautifully to the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has got a beautiful Christmas tree-like
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows one giant cola right up the
center.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole middle of the plant's going to
be one big giant bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you get a lot of nice side branching
that all fills in real nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only downfall is there is a little bit
of node spacing, a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: stretchiness, but I think that that is the
sought after, the desired fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got all of that Durbin poison flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got all the anise, the licorice,
the minty-ness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's got some of that Golden Goat to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's got that after you exhale,
it's like, why is there a skunk in the
[SPEAKER_00]: air?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't taste the skunk, but it smells
tropical, minty, anise, licorice,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then skunk in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people come into the room,
they're like, are you smoking skunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't taste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not in the flavor when you inhale or
exhale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just hangs in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the buzz from the 50-50 mixes,
which is exactly what I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got me psychedelic high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got me real slant-eyed, real
squinty-eyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got me walking kind of slow and
slowing down at green lights and fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: waiting for stop signs to turn green and
shit, but it keeps me nice and social and
[SPEAKER_00]: it puts a silly grin on my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ever get stoned and you just,
you can't help it, but you just make that
[SPEAKER_00]: stupid grin and somebody hates you for it
because you got that stupid grin,
[SPEAKER_00]: but who cares because it just feels good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives me that silly fucking stupid grin
and I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, I think those are the
phenotypes that you are going to find in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Double Dragon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy growing Double Dragon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love smoking Double Dragon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes crazy, crazy good concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the phenotypes are going to finish
around nine or 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some phenotypes may go up to 11 weeks,
but they are super potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find it to be worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the phenotypes will give you
pretty fat yields, nice heavy harvests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are super potent and all of
them are going to taste amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my report on Double Dragon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sticking to it.
