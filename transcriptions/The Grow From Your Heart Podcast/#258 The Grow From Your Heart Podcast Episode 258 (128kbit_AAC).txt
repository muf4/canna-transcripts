[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, welcome back, Cannabis Community.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time for episode number 258 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a source for cannabis news,
education, and conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, if you're a new grower,
if you're a professional grower,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you're a news smoker or a dedicated
dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or
[SPEAKER_04]: even someone who's just curious about the
current state of cannabis, this,
[SPEAKER_04]: my friends, is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_04]: My friends call me Ross DeJep.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_04]: Roots Band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big thanks to Kat, Coop, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ladies and gentlemen, you ask and you
shall receive.
[SPEAKER_04]: White Mike is back in the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the show, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: What up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_04]: I left a moment so that everybody could
applaud.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I was silent for a moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: In my mind, I just heard, woo,
yeah, and everybody was applauding.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, if you did not applaud heavily
at that moment, I will allow you to rewind
[SPEAKER_04]: your podcast 15 seconds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at that moment, I expect you to
applaud in your car.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the off chance Stitcher grabs the
episode correctly, there's a 30-second
[SPEAKER_02]: back button.
[SPEAKER_04]: Aw, poor Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_04]: For some reason, Stitcher keeps fucking
up.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think we've got it all corrected.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, for some reason, there's one
episode that Stitcher will not take.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stitcher decided y'all don't get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm part of y'all on that, which is a
little annoying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Mike didn't get to hear it either.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike listens on Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will not.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've sent me emails like, we fixed all
your problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, this episode won't go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: But count them, fuckhead.
[SPEAKER_02]: See those two numbers that are next to
each other that don't go next to each
[SPEAKER_02]: other in order?
[SPEAKER_04]: 252, 254, 255.
[SPEAKER_04]: See the problem here.
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, we're not going to call them
fuckheads because people do get to listen
[SPEAKER_04]: for free.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to just be like,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one throwback Thursday episode you
will not get.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when the time comes, when that number
falls in sequence, I will put it in the
[SPEAKER_04]: YouTube feed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will happen there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you'll get it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could listen to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just lazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are other ways to listen to it,
I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Stitcher just pretty much gave me a
big purple middle finger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to the website and listen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: The website's a piece of shit and it's
embarrassing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I said people could find other
ways to listen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't want to encourage that piece of
shit website being visited.
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, it listens just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can go there if you'd like,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as 253 is concerned, it's way
better than Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I mention on the last episode that I
met Mr. Jinx Proof?
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't tell you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stitcher didn't let me listen.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that was just a throwback Thursday
episode you missed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, just a quick shout out to a few
friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're not aware of Jinx Proof,
a big shout out to a breeder known as Jinx
[SPEAKER_04]: Proof, breeder of the nine pound hammer
and several other award winning strains,
[SPEAKER_04]: notable strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jinx Proof came to a grow store in Pueblo
West, Colorado and hung out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just hung out and visited, did a little
bit of a seed exchange and gave some
[SPEAKER_04]: advice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gave some talking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jinx Proof is a very positive dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jinx Proof has an autistic son and they do
autistic autism awareness.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a very cool wife named Miss Rose.
[SPEAKER_04]: He didn't bring the son or the wife,
but he came and hung out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to give a big shout out to my
friend Dung Beetle for inviting me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, it was random because I was standing
there and a dude walked up to me and he
[SPEAKER_04]: goes, hey, is this where Jinx Proof is
going to be?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he goes, are you Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, yeah, man, that's me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, dude, my name is Backseat
Jesse and I listen to the fucking podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, what's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I met Backseat Jesse, who comments on
my Instagram stuff quite a bit,
[SPEAKER_04]: who I've read his messages on the show
before.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was cool to meet him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I may have talked about this on a previous
podcast, it feels like.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also met a dude who goes by the name of
Paperweight Seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I met Backseat Jesse's brother also.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't think of the dude's name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Quiet guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool dude, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody kind of ditched us in the corner
when we were hanging out, having a little
[SPEAKER_04]: session.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he's a cool guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to hang out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to our friend Paperweight Seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to make some friends with some more
growers and breeders.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, there was a guy there whose name
I can't fucking remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Him and I hung out quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had some great terps.
[SPEAKER_02]: This happens at sessions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, when you smoke out and meet a bunch
of people, you're bound to forget
[SPEAKER_04]: someone's name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I get too high to enunciate?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you did.
[SPEAKER_04]: This could be interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to be a very interesting
podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to give a shout out to all
my friends for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got the opportunity to meet Jinx Proof.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jinx Proof is a very cool guy,
very inspirational person, very positive
[SPEAKER_04]: guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's weird because a lot of times when
you meet people that you see on social
[SPEAKER_04]: media or that you followed on YouTube or
whatever, when you meet them, they're not
[SPEAKER_04]: what they're cracked up to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: It happens a lot, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get to meet a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of people I meet are bags of
shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jinx Proof was cooler than I had imagined.
[SPEAKER_04]: He walked in and I was the first person he
saw.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just stuck my fist out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I go, what's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And gave him a fist bump because,
hey, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just did his thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: He walked in just like it was you or me.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, so what's up, man?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on, guys?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where do I need to be?
[SPEAKER_04]: How are things going?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I'm late.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a normal fucking dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he hung out and he talked with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I let him do all of his like meet and
greet business and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I went and talked to him and he
was just super cool, super legit.
[SPEAKER_04]: He didn't smoke with us because we were
smoking dabs and he's got epilepsy and
[SPEAKER_04]: he's afraid of butane, which I completely
respected.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, shout out to all my friends
that set up the meet and greet with Jinx
[SPEAKER_04]: Proof.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a great fucking time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike mentioned how high we were and why
we're so rambly.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got dabbed the fuck out on some Stardog
OG Shatter from our friends at The Craft.
[SPEAKER_04]: I picked it up at Three Rivers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We smoked a whole bunch of that shit on an
Instagram live video.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were on Instagram live way longer than
we were supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just meant to drop in and take a dab
and we hung out for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got rambly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It got rambly, but they like it when we
ramble.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, where else are we in this?
[SPEAKER_04]: So shout out to all my friends that joined
us on the Instagram live feed.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get a lot of inspiration for podcast
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've written down so many notes from those
conversations that we have on Instagram
[SPEAKER_04]: live and I'm going to put them into
podcasts.
[SPEAKER_04]: You may hear it in my voice, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am getting over a head cold,
a chest cold, a nasty fucking situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole gro's getting over a head cold
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can probably hear it in my lungs too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, everybody in our cultivation
facility passed around this little cold
[SPEAKER_04]: like it was fucking the plague.
[SPEAKER_04]: It got passed around like a joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it sure did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's probably got something to do
with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking safety meetings.
[SPEAKER_04]: It may have something to do with all that
shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I'm getting over it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Friday night and I'm finally
recording.
[SPEAKER_04]: This episode will come out Monday as
scheduled, but I am behind on my recording
[SPEAKER_04]: day.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes me a little antsy, makes me
anxious.
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize for sounding kind of raspy and
kind of shitty, but I've got a confession.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, you being late meant I could get over
here and be on the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you've been asked to come back,
so I'm glad that you're here, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I was going to confess to,
however, is being cold and having a chest
[SPEAKER_04]: cold and having a sore throat for a couple
of days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, by the way, this is not an ad for any
product, but if you take too much mucinex,
[SPEAKER_04]: holy fuck, you'll feel better and you'll
feel better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God, that was a fucking adventure.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit extra mucinex and a fucking
edible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa, holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm guessing most of that was the,
what'd you say, 120 milligrams of THC?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I haven't eaten edibles, you guys,
in over a year.
[SPEAKER_04]: You took a long.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took a long edible break, a really,
really long edible break.
[SPEAKER_04]: And definitely since well before March,
I was gifted some edibles.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I decided since I was sick and had a
sore throat, it was time to munch them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got down on an Afgato bar,
ate 60 milligrams of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, I kind of feel like I
might be high.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I ate 60 more.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, now I'm fucking high.
[SPEAKER_04]: That did it.
[SPEAKER_04]: 120 milligrams had my eyes a little red
and I was feeling a little loopy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I took a couple of small dabs
just to fucking push me right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it got me, I was pretty lit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm kind of back on the edibles train,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not gonna go crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't wanna be the super edible monster
that I was for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, it would not be a feat for me to
eat a thousand milligrams in one sitting.
[SPEAKER_02]: That used to happen regularly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once a week, once every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was hanging out with some guys that
liked to do the thousand and the 2,500
[SPEAKER_04]: milligram challenge every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: It started as a thousand and within like a
month it was to 2,500.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well yeah, because a thousand got easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've gotten really crazy metabolism.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could eat 120 milligrams and not be high
in two hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I eat 250 and then I'm not high in two
and a half hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I eat 300 and then I'm just super
high for an hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just all comes through at once.
[SPEAKER_04]: But once you start getting in the
thousands, that's when you start getting
[SPEAKER_04]: that four hour high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you eat that 2,500 milligram,
you get this vision quest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can do that to myself with 30.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the vision quest, but the bake for
three hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry that the iPad rang.
[SPEAKER_04]: That might have interrupted the recording.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the iPad rang though.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: I turned off all the phones and the
fucking iPad rang and tried to defeat us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very unprofessional.
[SPEAKER_02]: It did a really good job for the last
hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just dropped the ball now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have the little floppy thing
like the phone does on the side to put it
[SPEAKER_04]: all the way down.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can't turn it down.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just not even going to edit that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize that you guys got to hear the
iPad ring.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was awkward.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey Mike, where the fuck were we in this
podcast?
[SPEAKER_02]: Edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too many edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too many edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The numbers you throw out are just insane
to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I eat 10 for pain management reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I really like 10 of THC and 10 of CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not an intoxication that goes with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the pain relief I get from it is
really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I up the THC to 25 or 30,
I'm having fun for most of the night.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want any CBD in my mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: A friend of mine gave me one of the 100
milligram donuts for my birthday.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I ate half of that, I was ruined
for like four hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like giggle high, like laughing at
words, bro ads.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bro ads.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get us started on bro ads on our
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was listo.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the word that I died on that night.
[SPEAKER_02]: You learned it in Spanish, buddy?
[SPEAKER_02]: One of Davey's books.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has English and Spanish.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad you're teaching him Spanish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the wife said listo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I turned into a giggle puddle and had
to leave the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of these days when you're old,
you're going to hear the word listo and
[SPEAKER_04]: you're going to piss yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's going to be hilarious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, you guys don't go trying to
eat 2,500 milligrams of edibles unless
[SPEAKER_04]: you're...
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like Mike said, start off with like
30, 50.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go low.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can always eat more, but you can't
uneat those edibles.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you eat the drugs, the drugs is in
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you're spinning around wishing you
didn't do that, you're spinning around
[SPEAKER_04]: wishing you didn't do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I mention what we're dabbing on?
[SPEAKER_04]: I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're smoking some Stardog OG Shatter.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had some... There's some Bordello on
the table I'm going to dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what did you give me a dab of,
Mike?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You took some Chem 4 as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chem 4.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Chem 4.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm dabbing on some... I can't remember
the name of this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jackie's Mission.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jackie's Mission.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took a dab of that one earlier today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really enjoyed the flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: It made me so lazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: My knees and my lower back don't remember
that it's Friday and it was a long,
[SPEAKER_02]: hard week.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a long week.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just cheered up, chilled out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a lot happened this week.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were productive.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were quite productive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job to everybody out there busting
your ass, especially all the people out
[SPEAKER_04]: there doing the outdoor harvest season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in full swing big time now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in full swing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a treacherous year for all the
outdoor growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do I do next?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I should do this.

[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure it sounds like I'm just going
dankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Their ears are high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your guys' ears need a fucking cleaning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kidding.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for listening to the podcast while
I've got a head cold.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Dank Team ad is done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, you got anything you want to say
before I get into this email that I've got
[SPEAKER_04]: here?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Blank look on your face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Geez, your fucking wheels just locked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's lots of stuff I could ramble at,
but I want to see what we got in the
[SPEAKER_02]: email, Ben.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of curious what you're going to
ramble about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can read emails.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just pick one as if it's a stacking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Emails aren't going to shuffle through.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just throw one of your topics at me.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so today I saw this on five different
anti-plot pages that I follow.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was another recall today in Colorado
where some dispensary used some pesticide
[SPEAKER_02]: that isn't allowed in commercial use for
cannabis in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they sent their shit to be lab
tested, it tested for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It got recalled.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of that, the way it works in
Colorado is you can't send any of the
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest batch out before the lab test
comes back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of that product was still sitting
on a shelf waiting to be sent to a retail
[SPEAKER_02]: location.
[SPEAKER_02]: The announcement was the system working,
was legalization working, was a huge point
[SPEAKER_02]: of legalization being passed into law.
[SPEAKER_02]: Millions of people are already spending
billions of dollars on marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: The least we can do is make sure they're
buying a lab test tested product and know
[SPEAKER_02]: what they're getting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And is the system working?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see five different anti-plot pages
like, oh my god, it's not natural or safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a marijuana fail.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on the way over here,
I see that fucking, I want to say Safeway
[SPEAKER_02]: had their burritos recalled for Listeria.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when I get home tonight,
I'm going to be like, burrito fail,
[SPEAKER_02]: not safe or natural.
[SPEAKER_04]: Safeway is a dangerous corporation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't implode me in that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one of the five things that
flashed through my head when you were
[SPEAKER_02]: like, what do you want to rant about?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That cannabis got caught.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I am pretty sure that only
recreational cannabis is tested for
[SPEAKER_04]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that accurate at this point?
[SPEAKER_02]: The requirements are for both,
but the medical doesn't have to be
[SPEAKER_02]: submitted until January 1, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have any fucking labs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a whole other story.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't know, the places that test
the cantaloupe and the chicken wings
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't allowed to test the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of federal licensure.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first lab in Colorado that got set up
to test cannabis applied for that license
[SPEAKER_02]: and got rated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's wonky.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still building part of that system,
but all rec is tested for pesticides.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, all recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're buying, if you're coming from
another state or shopping at the
[SPEAKER_04]: recreational market, your product has been
tested, which is weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they would have done medical
first.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted to, but medical was already up
and running and had kind of built a stable
[SPEAKER_02]: system before they passed any of these
rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they were lobbied heavily by both
the testing labs and the rec owners.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rec owners have a hard enough time
getting their lab tests turned around in a
[SPEAKER_02]: reasonable amount of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they end up with products sitting in a
store room when they want it sitting on a
[SPEAKER_02]: store shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they lobbied pretty heavily to not
require medical submissions or turn around
[SPEAKER_02]: until there were enough labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, part of that's because in the years
since this was done, it's been like two
[SPEAKER_02]: and a half years.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've several more labs have opened up for
a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was fucking one lab in Durango that
could do one of the tests.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we do fucking send our shit to fucking
Boulder.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're in Pueblo and we have a courier.
[SPEAKER_02]: A dude comes from Boulder and then drives
all the way down to Pueblo, turns around
[SPEAKER_02]: five minutes after he gets there and
drives all the way back to Boulder.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the shittiest drug deal you
could ever imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd get one gram of everything,
please.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm going to drive for three and
a half hours home.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's the fun part is just pulling a
gram out of everything that we harvested.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we sit around at the grow,
just kind of one eye on our email,
[SPEAKER_02]: waiting for Christmas to show up when we
get our test results back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we've had some pretty nice test
results.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thirty threes, thirty twos.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a bunch over 30 this last round.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're doing all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting that grow dialed in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So shout out to the whole crew out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys are listening, much love and
respect to everybody that helps out in the
[SPEAKER_04]: garden out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the tremors, everybody in the whole
building.
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Killing it lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, boys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, shit, Mike, you're here.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the second thing on your mind?
[SPEAKER_04]: What grinds your gears?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God, I'm tired.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many different ways I go at
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can you be tired with all that?
[SPEAKER_04]: How can you be tired with all the Mountain
Dew you drink?
[SPEAKER_02]: The Mountain Dew I drink is the only
reason I'm able to function at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you've seen how insane I
am up front these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you add a two year old to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's a miracle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fucking talking English right now and
not just gibberish.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys want to hear about?
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to hear about Maine's governor
vetoing legalization that passed by
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking popular vote.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it passed and he just said,
no, it passed the state legislature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Senate had to pass rules and
regulations package.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the governor said no today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in his statement about it,
he specifies other states that have done
[SPEAKER_02]: this did so under an Obama administration
that was pretty clear that they were going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be hands off.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have that anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I ain't going to risk it, which is
nonsense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you remember, folks,
this was the governor who went on national
[SPEAKER_02]: television, elected politician.
[SPEAKER_02]: In front of a camera that he invited and
he says, and this is a quote or as close
[SPEAKER_02]: as I can get to a quote.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I apologize for the heavy racial over
to undertones and overtones.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this governor of Maine says,
we don't want to pass a law and encourage
[SPEAKER_02]: D money to come up here and impregnate
white girls with luring them with drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what his fear of marijuana
legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he threw out a couple of names like D
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't remember the other names.
[SPEAKER_02]: The two D money is the one that's stuck in
my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Slightly racist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, not even slightly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know how he's still got his
job after going on TV and saying that shit
[SPEAKER_02]: like six months, a year ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did you say it is?
[SPEAKER_02]: The governor of Maine.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, Maine.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how he still has his job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: All nine people up there don't give a
fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, freezing their dicks off and didn't
want to go out and vote on shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lucky ones found a way to move fucking
anywhere that doesn't suck.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, sorry, Maine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have to wait quite a while
longer for legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize if anybody heard that sniffle.
[SPEAKER_04]: We may have to press pause here in a
second.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting a pretty good sniffle setup
going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you just want to talk for a few
seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't know if they want me to do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hit pause and grab fresh drinks and
shit, buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, guys, we're going to take a
quick second.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to blow my nose.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to grab a quick drink.
[SPEAKER_04]: We may take a dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Love and kisses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, is that torch dying?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did it just die on you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, dab it quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll get it going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about fuckers?
[SPEAKER_03]: Plenty hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hot and hurty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who needs an esophagus?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you hit record before or after that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, right before that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took that right on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you didn't, I'm talking to the
microphone for no reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice dab, buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super hot dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike just gave me a dab of his bordella.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole fucking room smells so good
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my brain smells funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God, it was too hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was one of the heat cooking me than the
high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Face tingles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lung tingles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Finger tingles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it ain't burning and they working.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like questionable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this a stroke or an orgasm?
[SPEAKER_04]: Somewhere in the middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either way, don't stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hot dab face and the O face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Equally hilarious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, I'm glad you're laughing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun to watch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all are going to listen to me choke for
like five minutes here in a second,
[SPEAKER_02]: so don't feel bad for Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give fucking redemption.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you want to dab?
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine won't be super, super hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are my options?
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much Kim 4 or the Stardog.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Bordello.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I want a Bordello dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bordello it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Toss me a pencil dabber, and then we're
going to need some butane, sir.
I've got butane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listeners, we love you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You like it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like it when we get distracted and
dab?
[SPEAKER_04]: There should be butane in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: If not, we'll figure something out.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's somebody on their way here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll make them acquire butane for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the meantime, we can use the e-nail.
[SPEAKER_04]: This torch may have butane if nothing
else.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we're getting it going,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the dabber's too sticky to get one
dab, so you get four.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take all four of the dabs, Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to dab all four of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, welcome back to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm scared.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got hydrated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike got nicotine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got tea seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got caffeinated.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're doing just fine now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got that crap out of my nose.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for tolerating my head cold.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, thanks for coming over and helping
me put together a podcast when I'm not
[SPEAKER_04]: doing 100% with my head cold here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot easier to ramble with two
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to give the peoples what they want.
[SPEAKER_04]: That hissing sound is Mike filling up a
torch.
[SPEAKER_04]: I should have probably turned on his mic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the tane.
[SPEAKER_04]: The tane brain.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so let's get into an email.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been rambling a whole bunch.
Email.
[SPEAKER_04]: Email.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so this one comes from somebody
who did not mention if they want their
[SPEAKER_04]: name said on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: What up, Chris?
[SPEAKER_04]: Such a great fucking callback.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: That person probably doesn't listen.
[SPEAKER_04]: They probably hate us.
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_04]: Deleted all podcasts off their phone in
spite.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, our listener sent an email and
said, Rasta Jeff, I know you're a busy
[SPEAKER_04]: man, but could you point me in the
direction of some short growing strains
[SPEAKER_04]: that the dank team provides?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been viewing strains on their
website, but they don't show height stats
[SPEAKER_04]: on any of the strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: All that sound you guys heard was Mike not
being able to turn off the torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the torch fucking with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: The torch is trolling me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It did it to me earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would not shut off.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's becoming dangerous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I've been viewing the strains on
their website, but they don't show any
[SPEAKER_04]: height stats on any of the strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, a lot of the strains are hard to
find.
[SPEAKER_04]: On other websites, so I can't
cross-reference many of them to find this
[SPEAKER_04]: out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I tried to get through it without
choking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those dabs we took have me choking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: This listener wants me to give them
information on short growing strains
[SPEAKER_04]: available at the dank team.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I did a little bit of research.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do have some irie genetics available.
[SPEAKER_04]: Short growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I'm not sure Mike's dying over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Should I leave the mic on or not?
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll turn it down so that you can hear
him.
[SPEAKER_04]: While you turn purple, then pale,
a little bit of sweat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Mike is kind of like my Lee Syatt,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fun watching him change colors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, give me a thumbs up when you're
alive and we'll put your mic back on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't turn it on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm alive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't turn it on.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I'm not sure if you mean short
growing strains by height-wise or
[SPEAKER_04]: time-wise.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not certain what you mean by short
growing strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I read the question the first time,
I interpreted it, interpreted the question
[SPEAKER_04]: as height.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that I'm rereading it on the show,
I'm wondering if you meant time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Six-week-er?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you mean like some eight-week plants,
some seven-week plants, some nine,
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do you mean not as tall?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I may need to redo my research.
[SPEAKER_04]: But let's talk about- I'm coming back,
folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm putting your mic back on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just reached over to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike's back, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tagging him back in.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes my mic sound better, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get a little echo off that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: He lied.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's not back in.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm back-ish.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's something that fits both
categories, cookie-stomper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cookie-stomper, some of the cookie-stomper
phenotypes are done in like eight-ish
[SPEAKER_04]: weeks, 56 days, maybe 60 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, they don't get too tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: So cookie-stomper fits both of those
categories.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another one, prana.
[SPEAKER_04]: Prana is across a flow and a rise.
[SPEAKER_04]: Prana makes very unique smelling plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: They smell amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of them are done at like 55.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some are done at 60.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some are done at 63 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they won't get too tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, you all right, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: That tab's taking me places.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You weren't there for a moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I went somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, I wish I had video of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's better than here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have any snacks right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I say- I said cookie-stomper.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said prana.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I say the flow-stomper?
[SPEAKER_04]: Flow-stomper would be good for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't take too long to flower and
stay short.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another one that you will love,
that everybody will love, the morning dew.
[SPEAKER_04]: Morning dew is a grateful dog,
which is one of my prizes.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_04]: Across to a rise, which is another one of
a lot of people's favorites.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are two of my favorite strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bred both of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I crossed them together.
[SPEAKER_04]: I call it morning dew.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't get too tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some very Cush dominant
phenotypes in there that will give you
[SPEAKER_04]: some big fat, beefy Cush.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some Chem D in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's Joseph OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of great stuff in that Cush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Across, there's San Fernando Valley OG
Cush.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of things in there that will
give you some vigor.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll get some short, but buddy plants if
you find the right phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's stuff from iRegenetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about stuff from other
breeders.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, it looked like you had an idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're talking height or timeline,
if you're talking height and you're really
[SPEAKER_02]: restricted, shoot us an email with some
specifications of your grow area.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Jeff can come up with three or four
ideas to help you out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guaranteed on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lungs are still fluttering.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see it on you.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can hear it a little bit in you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a touch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you're good, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: You took a big old dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: You took four of your size dabs,
which is a one dab for a normal girl.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, another strain that I could
recommend.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's no dab competition.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just fucking with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another strain I could recommend that is
not from iRegenetics, but is available at
[SPEAKER_04]: thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's from our friends at La Plata Life.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would recommend the Durango OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: That finishes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got phenotypes that finish in eight
weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, when you're growing from seed,
you're going to find some phenotypes that
[SPEAKER_04]: finish earlier, some that finish later.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grow from seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get that earlier finishing one that works
best for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Finish it up that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking you've got what you need.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Durango OG will have eight week
phenotypes in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's another strain that I don't hype a
lot because it gets enough fucking hype on
[SPEAKER_04]: its own.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tangy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tangy from Crockett Family Farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you grow it up to be about,
I don't know how high your tight
[SPEAKER_04]: restrictions are, but it's not one of
those strains that stretch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plants do what we like to call the 21 day
stretch.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the first three weeks of flower,
they really like to take the fuck off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just the sky is what I like to call it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They like to just start taking off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tangy doesn't seem to do it as badly as a
lot of other plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tangy kind of doesn't do that stretch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them just race for those lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Tangy stays sort of low for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Tangy Crosses, Strawberry Banana Tangy,
the Taffy, stuff like that, which is Tangy
[SPEAKER_04]: and Affy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stuff like that will stay kind of short
for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they also, the Tangy Crosses,
don't take a real long time to finish.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that fits both of your timelines.
[SPEAKER_04]: That should be enough recommendations for
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, I'll put your mic back on.
[SPEAKER_04]: You look like you're back on the planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm mostly good to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're on Animal Planet again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Baked like a cake, but good to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Baked like a cake.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are some strains that are
available.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of stuff available from the
Cali Connection.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll find some eight or nine week
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That stays fairly short because they're
Kush dominant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not exactly sure what you meant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me know if you want fast flowering
or low height because short growing has me
[SPEAKER_04]: confused.
[SPEAKER_04]: At first I thought one thing and I read it
again and I thought another thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me know what you think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Randomly, I want to give a huge shout out
to my friends, the Lacewings.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: What up Lacewings?
[SPEAKER_04]: I just saw one fly by.
[SPEAKER_04]: I released Lacewings in a garden recently
and I just saw a Lacewing fly by here
[SPEAKER_04]: because they followed him home.
[SPEAKER_04]: To our friend that sent this email,
we're going to call you height
[SPEAKER_04]: restrictions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for the email.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me know how I can guide you more
carefully.
[SPEAKER_04]: I gave you a few strain recommendations.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to get more specific and
answer your question more specifically.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, you got any insight on that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, just let us know which one you meant
and we can get you a better list of quick
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or a better list of short strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or we can give you some specific grow tips
to work with your space.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can trellis down most plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put a little four by four or five by five
trellis net up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like just the square net.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen so many different methods.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But just let the plant grow into that and
then when it starts, it'll grow up into it
[SPEAKER_04]: and then just bend it down and keep it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Weave it into that basically is what
you're doing to keep it low.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't let it go up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let it go out and spread it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: One plant five by five.
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched a guy every morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: He went out and he dipped the top of his
plant into the next loop of chain link to
[SPEAKER_02]: the left.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And come October, it was just one long
vine that went halfway down his fence with
[SPEAKER_02]: little Christmas tree buds coming off it
every three inches.
[SPEAKER_04]: A big pine cone or a large pine cone
sticking off at each little spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: So instead of one giant glory bud sticking
up and touching the light, you get a whole
[SPEAKER_04]: room, a whole five by five section of just
beautiful little buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Little seven grammars everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice setup.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Scrog it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep them low.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let us know how we can guide you a little
bit further.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Since we're talking about seeds,
here's another question about seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, Hey, Jeff, I've emailed before
from Alaska about an auto flower and you
[SPEAKER_04]: hooked me up with the answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm hoping for a two for two.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a little while since you sent
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a ton of fucking emails,
but here you are.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you're still listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: He continues to say I'm interested in your
seeds and would like to know what strain
[SPEAKER_04]: is a good producer and good flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grow high O2 output, deep water,
hydro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I embarrassed myself with my last
episode about deep water culture and
[SPEAKER_04]: hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll go ahead and admit that I don't
have a lot of experience with that type of
[SPEAKER_04]: grow situation, but I do have a lot of
experience with strains that are good
[SPEAKER_04]: producers and good flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good producers, anything crossed to the
white widow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So widow gets nuggy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The look on your face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Widow gets nuggy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike's still high from the dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a white widow plant that my
father-in-law, of all people, grew that
[SPEAKER_02]: when people say white widow, I'm
immediately flashed back to that summer
[SPEAKER_02]: harvesting her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was just monumental.
[SPEAKER_04]: The storm shadow cross is what I'm talking
about from Irene genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: The storm shadow puts out huge colas,
tastes really, really amazing,
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of unique.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would go for the storm shadow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's white widow too.
[SPEAKER_04]: The rise.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also there's the cream.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cream doesn't harvest as well,
but the flavor is amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious what the look on your face
means.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sitting here trying to think of
strains and my list is very different than
[SPEAKER_02]: yours because it's generated from
different places and a totally different
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge base.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I chuckled because of our friend
44 in Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's sort of what people love about it
is it's got a smell and a flavor profile
[SPEAKER_02]: that most people find pleasant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it harvests like a motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another strain of mine that's available.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can either get it at the dank team.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's not available, the dank team
available.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I stutter on available?
[SPEAKER_04]: Another strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get it at the, what's it called?
[SPEAKER_04]: dankseed.co or just Google the Hella Dank
Seed Company and you'll be able to find
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But something I recommend is called
scarlet begonias.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's redheaded stranger to a rise and it
will produce huge crops and it will smell
[SPEAKER_04]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a few recommendations for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you find something you like in that
mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are two options to find seeds,
the dankteam.com and the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_04]: Co.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just Google the dank team seeds or the
Hella Dank Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of them will pop up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll be able to find what you need.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're on opposite coasts.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you live on one coast, maybe that'll
help you out with shipping.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've both got different deals.
[SPEAKER_04]: They both got different giveaways.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check out their websites.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you decide where to shop, I endorse
them both.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanna give a big shout out to the person
that sent this email.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you want me to say your
name, so I am not going to, but you know
[SPEAKER_04]: who you are because you wrote this email
to me in May and I'm just now reading it
[SPEAKER_04]: to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_04]: When my phone updated, it wiped out all my
emails off my phone and I had to go
[SPEAKER_04]: download apps for each individual email
address.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I've got a, yeah, well no,
then when I reloaded it on the app,
[SPEAKER_04]: it brought up so many fucking emails.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, I never even saw that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I printed them off.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasted like seven trees, but I've got
the emails and I'm reading them now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this one came from May and I'm reading
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize, but hey, I read it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna catch up.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many emails.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, you got anything you wanna add to
the good producer and good flavor from
[SPEAKER_04]: iRegenetic Seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I didn't think you'd have any better
insight than what I've got available.
Nope.
[SPEAKER_04]: That red headed stranger.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even hear the iRegenetic Seeds
part.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they want something from my line.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would say the Storm Shadow and the
Scarlet Bargonias.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, those are the way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some older stuff that will be a
lot harder to find than those that meets
[SPEAKER_02]: that definition, but.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Capleton.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, if you can get the Storm Shadow,
fucking dive on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bounty Killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Bounty Killer is what I was thinking
of specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where that's available,
but if you can find Bounty Killer seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: go get those if you want a big producer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like your standard movie theater
straw with a two liter bottle on it is how
[SPEAKER_02]: that plant built out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just fucking retarded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just insane nuggage everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got another email I want to read.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll ramble a lot through it, so I wish
you luck.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks long.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is kind of long, but it's quick and to
the point for being so long.
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy says, hey Rasta Jeff,
you don't know me, but I know you.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And his name is not Slim Shady,
but I don't know if I should say his name.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a stalker.
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, my name is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know me, but I watch you throw
your trash out every Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_04]: His initials are ZD and he says,
and I listen to your podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: What'd you say his name was?
[SPEAKER_04]: I said his name is Zane.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll call him Zane.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I listen to your podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been listening for a few months,
just keeping up with the most current one
[SPEAKER_04]: posted recently.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your podcast has recently started to click
with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of your latest GFYH podcasts,
you had set out a correctly used weed
[SPEAKER_04]: terminology like the phrase dabs instead
of dab when you talk about doing dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you brought up a good point and
it really seemed like a move I would do to
[SPEAKER_04]: I would do also in trying to help out my
weed smoking brothers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I feel more like your brother to me
than most and I gotta say it's all because
[SPEAKER_04]: of this badass podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: So keep up the good work brother and let's
work together to educate each other about
[SPEAKER_04]: what we are truly passionate about.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's more of the email, but I want to
say I like these emails when people tell
[SPEAKER_04]: me that they feel like they're my friend
because this may sound weird, but I'm not
[SPEAKER_04]: only a podcaster, but I listen to podcasts
as well, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm also a member.
[SPEAKER_04]: I listen to a lot of podcasts and I listen
to the podcast hosted by comedians.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't listen to a lot of cannabis
podcasts.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, the reason I don't listen to a
lot of cannabis podcasts is because I
[SPEAKER_04]: don't want to bite their style.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to accidentally steal their
voice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to contaminate my flow with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to become other people,
so I try to keep myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to our friends at the Dude Grows
podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great people, great podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're not listening to the Dude Grows
podcast, the Dude Grows podcast,
[SPEAKER_04]: just Google Dude Grows show.
[SPEAKER_04]: And listen, you'll love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is some of my favorite music.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wherever you're listening to my show,
the Dude Grows show is available there and
[SPEAKER_04]: please message them and be like,
hey, Rasta Jeff gave you a shout out and
[SPEAKER_04]: we're going to listen to your show because
I don't see a competition.
[SPEAKER_04]: They put out an episode every fucking day.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got time to listen to all their
stuff, listen, please do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have time to put out that much
content.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was listening to an episode of theirs
the other day and they were like,
[SPEAKER_02]: just hit 500,000, no biggie coming at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, fuck dude, 500?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys could cover my monthly salary
that I make at the Grow.
Hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just know if my listeners would cover what
I make monthly, like however I make on a
[SPEAKER_04]: good month, like with a little bit of
overtime and maybe a small bonus,
[SPEAKER_04]: just pay me what I expect to make in a
month, which I know what I bring in.
[SPEAKER_04]: If the podcast listeners could put that
together, I'm not asking you guys to do
[SPEAKER_04]: this, it's just a hypothetical.
[SPEAKER_04]: This would be the dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would put out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd go full Rogan.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would put out four episodes a week of
new content and then every Thursday I
[SPEAKER_04]: would still do a throwback Thursday.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd do Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday
and then I'd put out a throwback Thursday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Podcasts on a Friday seems weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think anybody would even fucking
listen to a Friday podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you put out a show on a Friday,
everyone's out partying, everyone's out
[SPEAKER_04]: doing their thing, nobody's listening to a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Road tripping.
[SPEAKER_04]: Road tripping?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then maybe a Sunday show.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'd put out at least four fresh
episodes and a throwback Thursday episode
[SPEAKER_04]: and I would also do a lot of YouTube
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would totally step up my social media
game, my live game, because I would be
[SPEAKER_04]: able to you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good time to plug Patreon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking multiply my content.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good time to plug Patreon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess we'll do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Patreon, since we're in the middle of an
email, Patreon is a service that allows my
[SPEAKER_04]: listeners to contribute to the podcast
financially.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a minute ago, Mike told me that his
microphone cover smelled like he'd been
[SPEAKER_04]: spitting in it for too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I said this one smelled like one that
hadn't been spitting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's kind of a freshy one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It smells like shoe polish or something,
doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it just smells like synthetic fabric
microphone cover.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got these black microphone covers from
China through Amazon and they stunk a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like new Halloween costume.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I had to leave them
sitting out for a while because the odor
[SPEAKER_04]: was really strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, Patreon, you can contribute to
the podcast by going to patreon.com slash
[SPEAKER_04]: grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_04]: Patreon will allow you as a listener to
financially contribute to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I will do with your contributions is
pay for my website, iregeneticscolorado
[SPEAKER_04]: .com, which is where I host the show,
which allows you as a listener to listen
[SPEAKER_04]: to the show for free.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a few people out there that
would like to contribute.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, what I do with those contributions
is I will replace these little fuzzy
[SPEAKER_04]: microphone covers so that they don't start
to smell like sausage and bad breath so
[SPEAKER_04]: that when other people come over to be on
the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get ragged after like 30 shows.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't let them go that long.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just bad hygiene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember that orange one was here
for like the first 50?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that was a certain person's mic and
he had a funky mustache and he used to
[SPEAKER_04]: always rub his mustache onto it and it
just funked it up real bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also buy a bottle of water and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would appreciate it if you want to go
to Patreon and help us out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not begging.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just letting you know that it is an
option.
[SPEAKER_04]: Patreon, p-a-t-r-e-o-n dot com slash grow
from your heart.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the information you need to be right
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Since I'm speaking about Patreon,
Kelvin Medina, huge gigantic shout out and
[SPEAKER_04]: a big fat hug.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate all of your support.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get back into this email.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say to loop back to the
email.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my favorite things about the show
is that it feels like when you're
[SPEAKER_02]: listening to it, it feels like I'm at the
table.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if that's because I'm
often at the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if that's just the feel that everybody
gets from the show or a lot of people get
[SPEAKER_02]: from the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've been listening a lot more now
that I'm over here less, mainly to fill
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the hours at work and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it makes me feel like I'm getting out
and doing a lot more than I actually am.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been listening to Joey Diaz on
podcasts for years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody that listens to this show knows
how much I listen to Diaz.
[SPEAKER_04]: Diaz is one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also Chris Hardwick and also Prueps,
Greg Prueps.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't listen to Prueps as much lately.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every show is the same lately.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, Prueps, I don't mean to say that,
but every show is the fucking same lately.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please switch it up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please switch it up a little.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've listened to all these comedians'
podcasts for so long.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck, Doug.
[SPEAKER_04]: How did I skip Doug Benson?
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I go to see them, it's just like
hanging out with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no such thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just start them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, hey, what up, Uncle Joey?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, what up, cocksucker?
[SPEAKER_04]: And fucking we smoke some weed together
and we hang out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I take friends with me or I take Jenny
Beth with me or I've taken other friends
[SPEAKER_04]: with me, dudes or females.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of them get jittery and they get
weird and they talk differently than they
[SPEAKER_04]: normally would when I'm around them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, Uncle Joey, it's so good to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, are you squeaking?
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, are you squeaking at Uncle Joey?
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't squeak when you talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: What the fuck are you doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: People change.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just like, hey, what up,
Joey?
[SPEAKER_04]: I got some weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to smoke it?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, you got a number,
Doug?
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking spark that shit up, bitch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably spent a couple hundred hours
with that voice next to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when he starts talking, I know what
he's talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I relate to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when these people, what I'm getting
to is when people say that I'm more like a
[SPEAKER_04]: brother, I reciprocate that feeling.
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand that probably more than some
people would.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a really random story that's going
to make me feel like a fanboy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been watching Chris Hardwick since
Singled Out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hardwick's an awesome comedian.
[SPEAKER_04]: Funny dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard him say several times,
I want to play Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris Hardwick is from Denver.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of his life goals, bucket list,
is to play at Red Rocks in Morrison,
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was on the Oddball Comedy Tour one year
that played at fucking Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_04]: He walked out on stage and took a selfie
of himself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he goes, I've always wanted to fucking
do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I felt an odd sense of pride.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you were watching a friend meet the
goal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you did it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, my bro just fucking got to
play Red Rocks, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And honestly, Hardwick's one of the few
I've never met.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen him.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen him do shows, but I've never
shook his hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never been.
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't seem like the type to hang out
after a ComedyWorks set in Smokey Joint by
[SPEAKER_02]: The Dumpster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: He seems like he'd need to be on a plane
to go film a talking show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to record the intro to his podcast,
then an airplane bathroom real quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, I relate to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when I saw Hardwick up there at
Red Rocks, I was like, my bro Hardwick is
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, I do get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not lost on me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Being recognized and known and
complimented and praised and whatever the
[SPEAKER_04]: other humble words are for it hasn't
gotten to my head too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It still means a lot to me to get
compliments.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to stay humble.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I think I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I want to continue with this email
because I'm making it really fucking long.
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually Mike's the damn rambly one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the link to the text on the page.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew this was going to be a good content
link email, folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's an email that I didn't print that
I wanted to read.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I may find it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We may press pause and find it here in
just a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy says, also, I live in Colorado
and I represent my state rights by
[SPEAKER_04]: maintaining my luscious closet grow
operation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to branch out with some new
genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel confident you've got the
quality I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go get a slapper, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can recommend to the dank team.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dot com or the hella dank seed company.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I can tell you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then he says, let's meet up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then he says he was going to be at a
comedy show, which already happened,
[SPEAKER_04]: and we did not meet up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I apologize for that, Mr. Zane.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I do appreciate the email.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry that I'm just reading emails
from September.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not too bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but they were in this email box that
I did your phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, hey, you don't get to see
these.
[SPEAKER_02]: I empathize.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a relative recently get married.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like from my nuclear family.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say that again?
[SPEAKER_02]: From my nuclear family.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nuclear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will you define that for me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Mother, father, brothers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nuclear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I just use a word you're not familiar
with?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know that I've ever heard it used
like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty high, and I was totally focused
on another idea in my head.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to go find this email where
somebody said something.
[SPEAKER_04]: But OK, nuclear.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for some reason, the family,
the email chain about the wedding,
[SPEAKER_02]: they used the email.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't checked since the end of high
school.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so at one point, I got a phone call
from the family member that was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, what the hell are you talking
about?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have plane tickets past that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't thought about it at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, well, check your email.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I opened it up, and I had like 208
un-responded emails about this event.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I'm not the white sheep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm looking for this for the last
email that you found.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but no, we'll just save it for
another episode because there are so many
[SPEAKER_04]: great emails in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're at like 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no need for me to go digging for
this other one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm high as giraffe pussy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought we were at least at an hour and
a half.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we would be if you hadn't taken a
cigarette break, Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how are we going to save the world?
[SPEAKER_04]: Save it or take it over.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys should really try this Portello.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, are you that lit?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The CBD, I think, wore off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I went from like a four to a seven
in the last 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Mike, I want to read this other
email because you're super high and
[SPEAKER_04]: there's no reason to do a recording if
you're this lit and having that good of a
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm having a good time with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure the listeners enjoy listening
to us.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I have to dig through my phone to find
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I need from you is like a solid
two minutes of just soapbox mic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want me to soapbox it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, get up on a soapbox.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so I got a fan reached out through
Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Law's
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook page and asked me about Texas'
medical marijuana law and some tips about
[SPEAKER_02]: advancing the legalization cause down in
Tejas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the first time ever looked up
Texas' medical marijuana law.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hadn't even heard about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd been so busy that got past me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And their law is like 10 milligrams of CBD
less than half a milligram of THC,
[SPEAKER_02]: oil only, like super bullshitty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were asking me what I thought
they should do to advance the cause.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I gave them the you can dig back
through the pile and find a whole 45
[SPEAKER_02]: minute show on like going to city council
and get involved in local politics and
[SPEAKER_02]: researching and going and making a solid
argument that we did for a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of gave them that spiel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought about it for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, don't fucking leave.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know a trade.
[SPEAKER_02]: You work in a trade, save up some money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the more I thought about it,
I'm like, if I was in that situation,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would save up as much as I could and I
would bail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, if it's possible for you to leave a
place that sucks and join a place that
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't suck, why not do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm thinking about Maine right now,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are a lot of people that work
really hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And easily the biggest moron in that
square area just fucked it up for
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now your choice is fight for another
two to four years and get back to where
[SPEAKER_02]: you were yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or work for six months, live on a tight
budget, move out of hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't say I don't recommend option
B.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you live in a place that's sort of in
between hell and heaven or hell in
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado, feel free to fight a lot harder
or maybe think a lot harder about fighting
[SPEAKER_02]: than moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're in a place where they're
still doing roadside cavity searches for I
[SPEAKER_02]: smell weed in the car ladies, like,
I wouldn't feel bad about putting the rest
[SPEAKER_02]: of my shit in the truck and heading out
with just me and my bank account.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to do so, have a plan,
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely come up with a plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, don't just run away.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not that hard to move across
country and start over, especially if you
[SPEAKER_02]: make a plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Save up some money, like more than a few
months rent and look for jobs in your area
[SPEAKER_02]: out wherever you want to move.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's there's like 26 states that
have medical programs.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: For a medical or for a marijuana job,
just because you're moving, this is
[SPEAKER_02]: something that we need lawyers and bankers
and welders, people to make tacos.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems to trip a lot of people up.
[SPEAKER_04]: They move here from another state and
they're like, I'm going to go get a weed
[SPEAKER_04]: job.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, what are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, no, I'm going to get a
weed job in the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be in the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, what are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you trim?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you bud tend?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you fucking grow weed?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm going to get a job in the
industry, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you're not.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to come be a burden.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a skill.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever you're doing, where you are,
you can do that here and have legal
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you're a deep sea fisherman,
we have your job here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know what I got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, no, seriously, like it's and that's
through the continental United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if really like you're like,
I can't give up deep sea fishing,
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking move to Oregon or Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're on a fucking ocean.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there are places you can go that
you've got your skill.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, what I'm saying, though,
is don't be too stubborn and think just
[SPEAKER_04]: because you're moving to a weed state,
you have to go full on weed and work in
[SPEAKER_04]: the weed industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be a weed stigram person.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking like you don't have to do all of
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just move here and have a normal
people job and have access to safe,
[SPEAKER_04]: clean medicine by going to a dispenser.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could be discreet about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can move here and never tell anybody
that you moved here for weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be like, why'd you move here?
[SPEAKER_04]: I hated Maine.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cold and shitty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Came to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: We definitely need like Colorado's
expanding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of people moved here.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need dentists and teachers and people
that are in their shirts and fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: business executives.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is that kind of show, folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Mike, I wanted you to ramble so
that I could find this email now that you
[SPEAKER_04]: found it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am here, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a quick one, but it's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: That looks like a full screen of text.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an iPhone.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that long.
[SPEAKER_04]: This dude wants to go by the name Collard
Green's so what up my G Collard Greens?
[SPEAKER_04]: The message goes like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Howdy, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just wanted to send you some growers love
from the great state of Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_04]: What up, you asshole?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been to Massachusetts, had a good
time, went to Newbury Street, hated it,
[SPEAKER_04]: but the rest of Massachusetts was decent.
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, been growing my own top notch
organic medicine for at least a few years
[SPEAKER_04]: now and I love everything about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, congratulations on the continued
successful garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm proud of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep it going.
[SPEAKER_04]: He also says the most addictive part of
growing of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me rephrase that and slow my face
down.
[SPEAKER_04]: The most addictive part of cannabis is
growing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Heard about your podcast from Scotty Real
and The Dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: A big shout out to those boys.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just gave them a shout out a moment
ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's what made me think of this email.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew it was coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, I really credit their podcast
with my excellent performance in my garden
[SPEAKER_04]: and now I get extra details to polish my
technique from your library of listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's something really funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: At least I thought so.
[SPEAKER_04]: I recall Scotty and The Dude catching
flack for too many F bombs and they
[SPEAKER_04]: mentioned that you keep it clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first episode I listened to,
you read a comment about your fucking cool
[SPEAKER_04]: show or something with lots of F bombs and
the next episode had a butthole song.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect timing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if they listen to the boofing
episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure which one was the butthole
song, but then he said, that's really
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not at all what I was expecting to hear
and I love you for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Earned yourself a new disciple,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, no secrecy about my name needed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not searching for cred, but not hiding
either.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep on teaching from Collard Greens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Collard Greens, I love you, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or nope to man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Love you, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for all the love.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for reaching out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: For a little while, when I first started
podcasting, I had a dirty mouth.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was on another podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was comedy based.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was hanging out with a group of folks
that thought they were comedians.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them were comedians.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them will and will not be
comedians in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them just watched the movie
Private Parts so many times.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them go hold a microphone for four
minutes and embarrass everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: But some of them are actually fucking
good, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kind of being a smart ass about
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when I would leave that show to come
record, when I would leave that show,
[SPEAKER_04]: I would come do this show with a bad
comedian attitude.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would just, it doesn't stop when you
act how you're fed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: So that comedy would continue throughout
my day and I would just come be a witty
[SPEAKER_04]: asshole.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it didn't work on the show,
but I would do it anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there came a point where I was
like, man, I cuss too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to stop cussing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I put up a swear jar to where
every time I said fuck, I had to put money
[SPEAKER_04]: in the jar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we donated that to a charity.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: That feels weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: I say fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a bad mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It helped to tone it down, but it got
unnecessary after a point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would feel weird because I'd come
over here and you'd be doing a really good
[SPEAKER_02]: job not swearing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be like, what up, motherfuckers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So well, eventually I decided,
fuck it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I say fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm an adult.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can put the explicit rating up.
[SPEAKER_04]: On iTunes and all the fucking adults can
listen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's how it'll fucking be.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, eventually I did just drop the
facade and I like to be myself on my
[SPEAKER_04]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's a lot more fun, honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somewhere around episode 100, I just got
really comfortable here with the
[SPEAKER_02]: microphone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm lucky enough to have been a guest on a
few podcasts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to my friend Tim Martin and the
John Doe Radio podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was lucky enough to be a guest on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a guest on a couple of other shows
and then also I got to be a co-host and
[SPEAKER_04]: producer of a whole other podcast that
did, we did close to 100 episodes before I
[SPEAKER_04]: parted ways with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They wanted to do a whole other thing and
the dude actually moved away from town.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just ended that relationship with
that podcast, but I got a very good warmup
[SPEAKER_04]: start there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was basically comfortable when I got
on this show.
[SPEAKER_04]: The hard part of this show is finding this
show's voice and the rhythm and what I
[SPEAKER_04]: wanted to do with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to have segments and weird shit,
but I think it's better when we just start
[SPEAKER_04]: and talk and hang out and have a good
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you first started doing the Throwback
Thursday episodes, I had completely
[SPEAKER_02]: forgotten the segments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the first episode where you
skipped a segment, I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, but where is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was expecting that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to keep all those segments
going.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to keep all that shit happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we got off onto a really good
ramble because of this email.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not necessarily the email's fault,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, shout out to all the good hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't felt well lately and I haven't
been able to dab hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike and I dabbed a little bit hard and I
think we got a little bit lit up tonight.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a long week.
[SPEAKER_04]: I needed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a long week.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank everybody for all the
emails they've sent me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I've got a bunch of emails from a
long time ago, but I will get to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will try to do my best to answer all of
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to our friend Collard Greens
for the great email.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for being a new disciple is what it
looks like.
[SPEAKER_04]: He called himself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for joining me, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do real disciples take people's phones,
add the podcast to their auto download,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then put the phone back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, shout out to my friend Brett,
also known as Mary's Motivation on
[SPEAKER_04]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brett will grab your phone and be like,
hey, you should listen to my friend Jeff's
[SPEAKER_04]: podcast and he will put it into your phone
for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Add it, so no work on your part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just click the button.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: All you got to do is listen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then every Monday morning,
a little icon will light up and it says,
[SPEAKER_04]: hey, yo, Rasta Jeff put out a new episode
and you should listen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rasta Jeff in the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, you guys, if you participated,

[SPEAKER_02]: Growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Life is difficult when you've got 42
different social media platforms to
[SPEAKER_02]: monitor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm a busy dude, so it's hard to go
through all of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll scroll through Twitter and be like,
oh fuck, I had that message a year ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't understand what we do at
work.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they think we're smoking a lot of weed
all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talk to people in the building that
physically see what we do all day that
[SPEAKER_02]: don't understand what we do all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of work, y'all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's before the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the personal life and the family and
all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The home grow and the fucking breeding
projects and the kids, whatever else
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody else has.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody at that grow has something else
going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Mike, we've been going for just
about an hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have anything to say?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you've got a microphone for your
face and a whole bunch of people are going
[SPEAKER_04]: to be listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out my social media if you're
interested.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Nemopunk15 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been a little uninspired with Pueblo
for Sensible Cannabis Laws lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to do a bunch of really long,
winded, elaborate posts and then get like
[SPEAKER_02]: one comment on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd get like 1,500, 2,000 views,
but one comment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And over the last couple of months with
the new gig, I've been a little
[SPEAKER_02]: uninspired.
[SPEAKER_02]: So keep hitting me up on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Re-inspire me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Re-inspire my buddy Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get him going, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go troll him a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get him fired up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We mentioned Patreon earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love it if you guys check us out
on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Patreon.com slash grow from your heart if
you would like to contribute to the
[SPEAKER_04]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would appreciate the support,
not trying to get rich.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, if you guys would like to pay my
monthly wage, I would just be a podcaster.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want a lot more content,
think about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So much content.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not asking one person to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm asking the collective.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, that may come true and I'd get
scared.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get that email one day and you're
like, well, fuck, I really like growing
[SPEAKER_04]: herb.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting old.

live and do an Instagram live video where
[SPEAKER_04]: I will talk about a lot of material that I
plan on doing on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get a lot of ideas from my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Live audience.
[SPEAKER_04]: I interact a lot and it's been a lot of
fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't do it constantly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to do it sometimes after work.
[SPEAKER_04]: After I've taken a shower, I'm sitting
here taking a couple of dabs and I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: chilling out.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my favorite time to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So check me out on Instagram live if
you've got the option and or opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lucky Instagram live viewers got a shot of
me on video today.
[SPEAKER_04]: They got to see Mike a little bit today.
[SPEAKER_04]: They know what Mike looks like.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's harder to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: People don't see me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounded weird when I said that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, if you'd like to contact us and
you are not into the social media thing,

[SPEAKER_04]: If you've been listening, you know by now
the email address is

[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank everybody that sent me
emails that got read on this episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank everybody that sent me
emails that got read on previous episodes
[SPEAKER_04]: and even more.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank people that send me
episodes in the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, episodes, emails.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck, I almost said something smooth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn, dabs are wrecking my brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fried too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe we're only at about an
hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels like this was a really long show,
a good show, but it feels way longer than
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You took that one dab, Mike, that made you
time travel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It did.
[SPEAKER_02]: That bordello took me fun places.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, CSC has just been crushing my meds
lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm loving it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also guys, don't forget a lot of videos
are up on YouTube now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been putting more and more YouTube
videos up.
[SPEAKER_04]: 109 I saw now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, one came out this morning too at 10
o'clock.
[SPEAKER_04]: 106 or 109.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number Alexia is fucking with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Number Alexia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got the numbers backwards.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just thinking about 69.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or 96.
[SPEAKER_04]: 96.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're doing it all backwards that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awkward.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe some editing to be done at the end
of this podcast or maybe not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it takes all kinds, folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes all kinds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike is one of those kinds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_04]: We take kindly to your type around here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We take kindly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I resemble that remark.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ladies and gentlemen, we're getting weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to turn off these
microphones.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to take a couple of dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oddly enough, more hash is the answer to
this particular one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think food is my answer here
pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got Chinese food at home.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not have Chinese food at home,
so you shut your mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to have soul food in a
little while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't hate.
Whoa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cutting deep, Whitey.

[SPEAKER_04]: Follow us on all the social media.
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen to us on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize if Stitcher fails.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys have to be on my control.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing my best.
[SPEAKER_04]: They keep sending me emails that say,
oh, well, that's all I've got for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to quit rambling.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to give a huge shout out to
my friend Bag Seed Jesse.
[SPEAKER_04]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than often I drive so much it is like
my ass is my feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see little black furry running dogs and
I'm standing up in my seat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm standing up in my seat to avoid sleep
driving, crashing and dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotta turn up the tune.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rest area next right is my side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Salvation because I'm running on fumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running on fumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running on fumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lids get heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The window goes down on my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I begin to beat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep my eyes open until I get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll kick the back of that bucket
seat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gonna kick the back of that bucket seat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scattered, smothered, covered,
and chunked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a short stack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain dew, many thins, and camel
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a box or a soft pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Box or a soft pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dollars is cheap for five hours in a motel
bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Truck stop shower is only $5.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'll go with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, I'm going with that instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it when it all runs together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta think about where you've been.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the places and the weird looking
faces.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it when it never ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wake me when this song ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the windows here become the paintings.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the glass and the world as the
canvas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a peaceful diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like two gentle arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hugging me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a four points chair that hangs
on two chains.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an old back seat of a Jeep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't mind shooing the dogs off to
observe the world revolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Observe the world revolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Observe the world revolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sun goes to China.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sky comes alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those paintings, a purple swirl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lift up the glass and you climb into the
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you deeply breathe and absorb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deeply breathe and absorb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know there should be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be nice if everywhere were here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we would not have to leave or drive
or fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or hurry real fast or decide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hurry real fast or decide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because more than often I drive so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like my ass is my feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see little black furry running dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm standing up in my seat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm standing up in my seat.
[SPEAKER_00]: To avoid sleep driving, crashing,
and dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to turn up the tune.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red stereo, your next ride is my
salvation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm running on fumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running on fumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running on fumes.
