[SPEAKER_01]: I like to start the podcast off by talking
about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Orange
Skittles Live Batter from Apothecary
[SPEAKER_01]: Farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the package, it says the product
contains 77.2% total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best way I can describe this product
is when I open the jar, it smells like a
[SPEAKER_01]: bag of sour skittles sitting next to some
funky, greasy oranges.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love this delicious, sour, orangey
smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I absolutely love the buzz I get from
the orange skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me nice and talkative.
[SPEAKER_01]: It puts me in a good, friendly mood.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is going to be perfect podcast
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out to my friends at
Apothecary Farms for the Orange Skittles
[SPEAKER_01]: Live Batter.

[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first episode of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast came out on March 28th,
[SPEAKER_01]: 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have been doing this for six years,
ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Six years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not missed a Monday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been fairly consistent with the
Thursdays.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been having a great time and I
could not have done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not have done it without you and
all of the support.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for all of the emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for all of the messages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for all of the YouTube comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for all of the iTunes comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: An extra big thanks for all of the support
on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, all of the support with my
other endeavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever that is, if it's iRead Genetics,
if it's podcasting, if it's the Instagram
[SPEAKER_01]: Live stuff, thank you guys for all of the
support.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys really make my life wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without you guys, my life would not be
what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it and I respect it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big thank you to everybody for the
continued support.
[SPEAKER_01]: We recently hit episode 500, which felt
like a huge milestone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we are at six years of podcasting,
which feels like another huge milestone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really see no end in sight, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am going to keep podcasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as I've got a voice, a microphone,
and a couple of good toys to play with,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we've got the Internet, I will keep
putting out quality podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for the support and look
forward to many more years of continued
[SPEAKER_01]: quality podcasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like at this point in time,
at this state of affairs, in this weird
[SPEAKER_01]: situation in the world, I feel like
content providers and content creators
[SPEAKER_01]: will be a big part of what get us through
these strange times.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of our entertainment avenues have
been shut down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't go to comedy clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't go see live music.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bars have been closed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The restaurants have been closed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all facing weird times because of
this coronavirus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that people are going to turn
to podcasts and YouTube and other forms of
[SPEAKER_01]: entertainment to keep them sane.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am going to do my best to keep
quality podcasting coming until there is a
[SPEAKER_01]: major reason for me to stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to have to stop me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to have to take this
microphone away.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to have to take my toys
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do it till the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know that people are relying on
me, not just to keep their gardens up to
[SPEAKER_01]: speed.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point in time, we're relying on
each other just for sanity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing podcasts to fill the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing a little self-quarantine,
a little social distancing.
[SPEAKER_01]: During that time, I won't see a lot of my
friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't be going out and about like I
normally do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will have more opportunity to sit
here and focus on better podcasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to make an effort to do that
because I know you need that at this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting a lot of my social interaction
through social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do Instagram live videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go watch my friends' videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been FaceTiming more.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have to find better ways,
safer ways, different ways, alternative
[SPEAKER_01]: ways to communicate, to socialize and get
our entertainment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really feel like it is time for
podcasters and content providers to step
[SPEAKER_01]: up and fill that gap.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're stuck at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might as well produce better content
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to keep it going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I've been really ranty on a
couple of episodes lately, but we've been
[SPEAKER_01]: FaceTiming with a lot of weird things and
I've got a lot of weird shit on my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe since I'm not getting out and
seeing my friends and my friends aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: coming here, maybe I'm just extra
talkative when I turn on the mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just got a lot of shit to say,
it feels like.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are crazy times, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you think about it, we are a big
part of history.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are here listening to this podcast,
you have gotten to see a lot of monumental
[SPEAKER_01]: moments in history, world history,
American history.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're here listening, you are seeing
the legal ization of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, that is way on the back burner
of everybody's mind for the next couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are in the midst of nationwide
cannabis legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: It started several years ago in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it slowly crept through other states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then once California, Colorado and
Washington all had major cannabis laws in
[SPEAKER_01]: place and it was working.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when shit started flowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I think we have got more states
with positive cannabis laws than we do
[SPEAKER_01]: states with complete prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you are witnessing the sweep,
the shift, the transition of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization nationwide in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are getting to see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if you are witnessing and you are
part of this coronavirus, you are seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: something that we have never seen before.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have seen many weird tragedies and
weird things and events unfold in the
[SPEAKER_01]: states and in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've never seen anything like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it may seem weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may seem uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may seem scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may just seem like a big joke to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever it seems like, pay some attention
because this is a major historical
[SPEAKER_01]: monumental time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are going to be talking about this for
a hundred years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be talking about this to
our grandchildren and their children.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pay attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take some notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just be aware of what's going on around
you because this is a crazy time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I know I keep saying this,
but in these crazy times, the most
[SPEAKER_01]: important thing to do is to be good to one
another.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look after each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't get through these crazy times on
our own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some crazy fucking people will get through
on their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of us need each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of us don't want to get by on our
own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of us would rather put a handout and
help somebody and have somebody stick
[SPEAKER_01]: their hand out and help us in return.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way it should work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be kind to everybody right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a little bit of extra patience with
everybody around you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And remember that everybody is dealing
with this weird situation and we are all
[SPEAKER_01]: going to deal with it in our own weird
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't all respond to situations
similarly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should be obvious by social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are completely freaking out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people don't give a shit and some
people are right there in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: However you are choosing to deal with
these weird times, with this weird
[SPEAKER_01]: situation, keep in mind that we are all
dealing with weird shit as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are all uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are all adjusting our lives and
schedules.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've all been cooped up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all want to make sure we eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all want to make sure that our families
survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all want to stay healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not the only one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do our part together to keep an eye
on each other and keep each other safe and
[SPEAKER_01]: happy and healthy and let's just be kind
to one another in any and every way that
[SPEAKER_01]: we can you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that most of my audience,
most of my friends, most of the iry army
[SPEAKER_01]: and the grow from your heart crew doesn't
need to hear that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just a simple reminder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes in weird times we forget the
basic shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most important basic shit is to love
one another and be kind to each other and
[SPEAKER_01]: we will get through this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright you guys, I feel like I'm fucking
super ranty and super preachy,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I also feel like if it's my
responsibility to provide content and keep
[SPEAKER_01]: people entertained, I've also got to speak
the positive message.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the message.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can fucking do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care of everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's focus on a cannabis based
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the part of the show where I start
reading emails sent in from our listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a cannabis culture or a
cannabis cultivation question,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: My email address is grow from your heart
at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first email for today's episode goes
just like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: What up Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_01]: If this makes it to your show,
feel free to throw my name out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I recognize your name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've said your name on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to our friend Thor.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is back with another question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I got a few head scratchers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to run by you and see what you
think.
[SPEAKER_01]: It starts off with my little brother has
ADHD really badly, which he takes Adderall
[SPEAKER_01]: for.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been on Adderall pretty much his
whole life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes him very irritable and a zombie.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm in the works of trying to get my
mom to try him on CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question for you is if I was to run a
CBD plant in the same tent with my other
[SPEAKER_01]: babies, would it hurt anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been holding onto these CBD seeds for
a while now because I'm scared the CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: will affect my THC content on my other
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you were honestly not the first person
to ask that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to kind of clear up the question
for other listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our friend Thor here has a garden with
normal cannabis plants where he is growing
[SPEAKER_01]: to achieve high THC potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wants that THC buzz in most of his
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, he's got a family member
who is on medication that makes them a
[SPEAKER_01]: zombie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's trying to offer CBD as an
alternative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he wants to take it upon himself to
grow that CBD in his grow tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: With his THC rich plants and he is
concerned that that CBD plant may somehow
[SPEAKER_01]: disrupt or contaminate his THC garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have no fear, my friend, because nothing
bad will happen to your THC crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will be able to grow your THC plants
right alongside your CBD plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything will be perfectly happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing will go wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are basically growing a different
phenotype of the same type of plant next
[SPEAKER_01]: to other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got, I'm just going to make
up strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got Arise and you've got Golden
Goat and you've got OG Kush in one room,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you add whichever CBD varietal you're
going to put in there, it's going to think
[SPEAKER_01]: you just put in another OG Kush or another
Golden Goat or another Arise.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically just like putting another
cannabis plant in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main difference is that that plant has
bred to express different cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants you are familiar with growing,
if I bred them, if other breeders bred
[SPEAKER_01]: them, we probably bred them to be rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants that are rich in THC,
those plants that are rich in CBD are the
[SPEAKER_01]: same plants, just bred for a different
goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: They bred, they found plants with CBD in
there, then they isolated those and bred
[SPEAKER_01]: to those again and repeated the process
until they stabilized that CBD dominant
[SPEAKER_01]: trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is the same type of a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will grow similarly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may have different characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may want slightly different things
because it is phenotypically different,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it will not have any adverse effects
to your THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: A really simple way to think about this is
if you've got a farm full of chickens and
[SPEAKER_01]: you put a turkey on the farm, do your
chickens turn into turkeys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody just stays exactly what they
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your cannabis plants are going to continue
to produce that THC rich bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your CBD plants will begin to produce that
CBD rich bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything will go just as nature intended
and I think you'll be a happy camper and I
[SPEAKER_01]: really hope that the CBD medicine works
well for your brother so we can help out
[SPEAKER_01]: with that ADHD and maybe kind of,
we can't take away the Adderall right
[SPEAKER_01]: away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a doctor, but maybe we can
minimize that, get a little personality
[SPEAKER_01]: back into them, make them a fun little
brother again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully that works for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so that is the first half of
the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can totally put your CBD rich plants
in with your THC plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing will happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing bad will happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you grow properly, you will have two
marvelous types of medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll work for your brother and
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said before, if you put a goose in
the chicken pen or if you put a turkey in
[SPEAKER_01]: the cow pen, we don't get different types
of animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody stays the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the best of my knowledge, plants will
work just the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're definitely not going to disrupt the
THC production or the CBD production.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is another half to this question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm super rambly because of that dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, my other question is about
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm currently trying the Advanced
Nutrients three part, Grow Micro and
[SPEAKER_01]: Bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the label, they advertise that their
product is pH perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still check my pH when I water because
I'm not sure if it is safe to trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any experience with Advanced
Nutrients and pH perfect products?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I do have some experience and some
input and some feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first started taking growing
seriously and was really trying to up my
[SPEAKER_01]: production, I was sold by the Advanced
Nutrients pitch of you will get 30% more
[SPEAKER_01]: product just by using all of our bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really thought that that would work well
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did achieve that 30% that they talk
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed that my yields in my harvest
were bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing I did not like about Advanced
Nutrients, and this is just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no hatred for anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was just my experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran multiple different strains in the
same room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had cherry widow in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had blueberry in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had white rhino in that room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had several different varietals in that
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I grew them using Advanced Nutrients,
bottled nutrients, most of my flowers
[SPEAKER_01]: looked and smelled the same once they were
harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was not a big variation in my
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I carefully selected my strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had that cherry widow because it's
cherry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got that really funky cherry flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had blueberry because it's got a very
distinct blueberry flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had white rhino because it would make
giant buds that were covered in resin and
[SPEAKER_01]: had this really sweet flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the end of the grow, it all looked like
white rhino.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all looked like cherry widow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't tell the buds apart if you
put them in a bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really blame that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really attribute that to the Advanced
Nutrients product line.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know exactly what does it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my assumptions and my theories.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot prove that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to say it because I have no
science to back it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really think those nutrients made all of
my flowers, all of my buds look smell and
[SPEAKER_01]: taste exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now let's talk about the pH perfect
part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the science behind it,
but if you mix their nutrients in the
[SPEAKER_01]: proper ratios, they will come out pH
perfect at 6.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: If 6.5 is your goal, that is a beautiful
process that does save you a step.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would, however, check every time I mix
my nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it is off, that may indicate that you
skipped a bottle or perhaps doubled up on
[SPEAKER_01]: a bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in my experience, those solutions did
mix up to pH perfect at 6.5 if I used the
[SPEAKER_01]: appropriate amounts of each product and if
I mixed it appropriately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the claim of pH perfect does hold up in
my experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: The claim of 30% more product does hold up
in my experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only downside I noticed from using
that line of products was that most of my
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers looked, smelled and tasted exactly
the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of growing multiple strains,
I should have just ran a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: one strain to make the entire room
uniform.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nobody wants a whole bunch of one
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would like variety, at least in my
circle, in my area, people demand variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the way I had to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the pH did work for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I recommend that you do check
your pH every time you mix just to be
[SPEAKER_01]: safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can tell you if you messed up in your
mix, that can tell you if you overfed
[SPEAKER_01]: something, if you underfed something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, it's a good way to make sure that
that pH pin is working.
[SPEAKER_01]: If something is off, calibrate the pin,
then check the solution again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you know if your pin or your solution
is off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys make sure you calibrate your
equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I just went on a way side road.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get lost on this side
street for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come have fun with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always fun on the side roads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make it a habit to routinely calibrate
your pH meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make it a habit to routinely clean your pH
meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make it a habit to routinely clean your EC
meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean and calibrate all of your tools and
equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if you've got anything with a filter
in it, if you've got an air conditioner
[SPEAKER_01]: with a filter, clean that filter on a
regular basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every month or every two weeks should be
your standard cleaning schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get in there at least once a month and
clean the shit out of everything that
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to be cleaned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, every harvest, do a thorough
deep cleaning before you refill the room
[SPEAKER_01]: with plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're running a perpetual grow,
there is one area of that grow that is a
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a minute to clean it up before you
put the next batch of plants in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to gardening, cleanliness is
next to godliness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean that shit up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're playing God in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my side rant, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calibrate your equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean all your equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep everything nice and tidy and nice and
organized.
[SPEAKER_01]: A nice clean workspace makes everything
flow so much more smoothly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps you keep your tools, your
equipment, and your thoughts and your
[SPEAKER_01]: plans and your goals more organized.
[SPEAKER_01]: So calibrate your shit, clean your
filters, and just clean up and organize
[SPEAKER_01]: your grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: It only takes a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you really clean up, it'll save you
time in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't wonder where your scissors are.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't wonder where your pH pen is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's right there, right where it should
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean up after yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will save you so much time in the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that scrambly feeling in your brain
will minimize, and you can focus more on
[SPEAKER_01]: the task at hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to get myself back on track.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of task at hand, there is more to
this email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, where can I find some lemon
Jeffrey genetics?
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, the answer to that is
seedsherenow.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you use coupon code GFYH10 at
checkout, and you will save 10%.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wraps up the message with, your podcast
has easily become my favorite podcast,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I listen to every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, not to mention it has educated me so
much as a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for all of your information
and hard work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, that's a great way to wrap up an
email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that I'm your favorite podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you're listening every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you're getting educated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I'm glad you're becoming a better
grower because of the time I spend talking
[SPEAKER_01]: into a microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are getting better at their craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting better at their passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting more passionate about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, they're making a better product
with that passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a huge compliment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome for all of the information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I've been given a serious
gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a lot of gifts.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gift to absorb information and learn
so quickly, and then also to have been in
[SPEAKER_01]: the place where cannabis was legalized,
where I had all these opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that those two things were major
gifts that lined up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then also to have this personality,
this gift of gab, this inability to shut
[SPEAKER_01]: the fuck up, this constant need to be
talking and teaching and sharing ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that is a gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's a curse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think I have harnessed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And turned it into a gift, the gift of
being able to learn something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also the gift of being here in
Colorado, where cannabis was legalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this other gift of being able to
share my ideas articulately.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that was something that was
given to me that I am supposed to use in
[SPEAKER_01]: this exact manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I didn't do this, I think something
would go wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I would just explode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may spontaneously combust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing in my world would be right if I
didn't share this information and this
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like whatever you believe,
if it's God, if it's Jesus, if it's the
[SPEAKER_01]: sun, if you believe in bacon, whatever you
believe in, I'm gonna go with yours
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's much easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you believe in, that deity,
that creation gave me this gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I didn't use it, it would almost be
disrespectful to bacon or the sun or
[SPEAKER_01]: whoever you believe in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm cool with whatever you believe in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty open-minded.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm down with, but it's much
more friendly if I just let you have yours
[SPEAKER_01]: for a moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whatever you believe in gave me this
ability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would be disrespectful and selfish
to bottle it up and not put that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for noticing and thank you
for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wraps up the message with, take a fat
dab and give your mom a hug for me,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro, from Thor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Thor, I am going to take a gigantic
dab as soon as I wrap up this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I promise you that the next time I see
my mama, I will give her a big old hug.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm gonna tell her, that was from
my buddy Thor and she's gonna be really
[SPEAKER_01]: confused, but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the great message,
bro.

cultivation or a cannabis culture

What a beautiful buzz.
