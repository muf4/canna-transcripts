[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: welcome to the podcast everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode 800 of the grow from your
heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I've got a fun show lined up
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I'm going to give away
free seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've teamed up with my friends at seeds
here now.com to give away free iri genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk more about the free seed
giveaway later in this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to remind you that team iri
genetics will be at the dude grows cup,
[SPEAKER_01]: June 3, just outside of Fort Collins,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come say hi to team iri genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have Mike with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come say hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come give me a fist bump, shake my hand,
take a selfie, grab some seeds if you need
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot wait to meet you with the dude
grows cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check out DGC cup.com for
all the links, deets, details and ticket
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I want to send a big shout out to
everybody who supported the iri direct for
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sale was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys did a great job on that sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of you may have noticed that for a
moment, everything on iri direct was
[SPEAKER_01]: marked sold out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was because I got so many sales on
the 420 sale that I could not keep up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to mark everything sold out so that
we could catch up and actually get the
[SPEAKER_01]: orders caught up and get to zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing an inventory.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are regrouping.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're rebuilding part of the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to make sure that all these sold
out stuff is removed and the insta in
[SPEAKER_01]: stock items are updated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it will send you a new newsletter and
we will do a fresh drop in a fresh restock
[SPEAKER_01]: here for the month of May.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a lot of great things ready to
put out a lot of great things planned for
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you did notice that everything was
out of sale on iri direct, have no fear.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time this episode comes out,
there will be plenty of new stock on the
[SPEAKER_01]: website.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to stay updated for those new
updates, new drops, new restocks,
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure you join the Patreon at patreon
.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone on Patreon does get the first
heads up on drops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course, there is the
newsletter on the website at iri genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: .com.

[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to stay here and keep rocking
this cannabis podcast to make you guys the
[SPEAKER_01]: best growers that we can all possibly be
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you guys for 800 episodes of
support.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fucking tremendous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, let's move off of the ramblings and
business part of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's jump into some grow topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking to a friend earlier today,
and we're talking about just rebuilding
[SPEAKER_01]: grow rooms and redesigning spaces and
ideas and goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then every time we talk about adding
more shit to a grow, my brain says,
[SPEAKER_01]: keep it simple stoner, the more shit in
that room, the more operating pieces
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got, the more shit can go wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work in commercial facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I train people to work in commercial
facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we have a new hire, the first thing I
tell them so I have them meet me at the
[SPEAKER_01]: door to the facility on day one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I unlock the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: We walk in together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We clock in together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I teach this person how to run the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They walk in right with me before we walk
into the grow on the very first day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell them the first thing we are going
to look for today is to find out what
[SPEAKER_01]: broke last night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that sounds very not very
optimistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you run a commercial facility
with somewhere between two and 500 lights
[SPEAKER_01]: or maybe even more, in some cases,
there are a lot of lights, a lot of fans,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of pumps, a lot of random equipment,
humidifiers, dehumidifiers, cameras,
[SPEAKER_01]: sensors, detectors, emitters.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a ton of shit that can go wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Something is going to go wrong no matter
how much maintenance you do, no matter how
[SPEAKER_01]: much care and upkeep you give.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are constantly moving pieces in a
commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something will go wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing you need to do when you go
in, I teach is go look for the shit that
[SPEAKER_01]: broke.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my theory is the less moving parts you
have in a personal grow, the less shit
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got to break.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of keep it simple stoner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that reminds me of and
brings me to is when I started growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: we did not have all these monitors and
devices and technology and toys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to learn the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants are what was telling me I'm
over watered.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm under watered.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too hot in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too cold in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've given me too much nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You haven't given me enough nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants are what I have learned as my
monitors, my meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't use a bunch of technical stuff in
my grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a pH pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an EC meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got monitors to tell me what the
temperature and humidity are in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I don't really use a lot of super
overly complicated technical shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I need to know if it's too hot or too
cold in my grow, I look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: thermometer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I need to know if the humidity is too
high or too low, I look at the hygrometer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are two really easy pieces of
equipment to read that tell me what my
[SPEAKER_01]: room is sitting at, the temperature and
humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are two of the most important
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: If those are cool, then I look at the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the plants look like this and they're
green, nothing to fuck with.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're yellow, if they're going
sideways, if the leaves are twisting,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's something to deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those leaves are telling me exactly what
the problem is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look at the leaf, I go, it's kind of
yellow in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs some nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I look at the leaf and I go,
oh, it's getting crispy at the tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm feeding it a little bit too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can identify all of those problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm kind of getting at is you guys
don't rely on so much of that equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it simple, stoner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn how to identify what the plants are
telling you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn how to identify it early and how to
react to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see this, how do you respond to it
to correct that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because another thing, once you identify
the problem, how are you going to correct
[SPEAKER_01]: it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Many new growers see a very small problem
and they turn it into a big problem by
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to over correct that problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say, oh, I need a little bit of Cal
Mag.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I read that when you give Cal Mag,
you need to give phosphorus or potassium
[SPEAKER_01]: or also maybe I should add some of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just get these bright ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if I put this in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You had a Cal Mag deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Add a little bit of Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was probably calcium and not magnesium,
but they're sold in the same bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: You see that little bit of a problem and
you want to fix 12 different problems or
[SPEAKER_01]: throw 12 different things at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you throw everything out of
whack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just carefully fix that one problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm rambling about is you guys learn
the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it simple, stoner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't rely too much on monitors,
equipment, gear, toys, tools, and
[SPEAKER_01]: technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we've been doing this for hundreds of
years, growing plants without all that
[SPEAKER_01]: shit, we've just been looking at them and
going, hey, Bill, this plant's yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: What should we do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it more nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been it's been that simple for that
long.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's learn these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are plenty of charts on the Internet
that will tell you if your leaves look
[SPEAKER_01]: like this, here is the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your leaf looks like this, here is the
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those charts are quite accurate if you
learn how to read them and become very
[SPEAKER_01]: discerning because, of course,
a couple of them look similar and can be
[SPEAKER_01]: confusing, but really pay attention to the
details and pay attention to what you fed
[SPEAKER_01]: also.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll know, did I give it too much
nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I not give it enough phosphorus?
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be able to tell based on what the
leaves are doing and what you have fed
[SPEAKER_01]: that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how I wrap up that section where
I call it keep it simple, stoner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's not focus so much on the toys and
the technology, but let's learn how to pay
[SPEAKER_01]: attention to the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because after all, the plants are the boss
in our grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's segue into everybody's favorite
part of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into the email portion of
today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a stack of questions here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This first question did come from the grow
help submission tab on iriegenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a grow help question,
go to my website, iriegenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a row of tabs at the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them says grow help or grow
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Click on that tab will give you the
opportunity to fill out a little
[SPEAKER_01]: questionnaire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you get to tell us what's wrong with
your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I select your question and read it here
on the podcast, guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You win a free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this message came from my friend Chivo
del Norte.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Chivo.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have won a free pack of iriegenetic
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please send me an email with your shipping
address and also include a real name that
[SPEAKER_01]: I can put on the box for those seeds
because I have to hand deliver these
[SPEAKER_01]: packages to the post office.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they see weird random names,
they look at me kind of funny and I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want any problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's put a real name on the package,
please.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, this grow question goes just
like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, yo, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to meet you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've met you before online.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the great message.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I want to say that I really
appreciate you and what you do for the
[SPEAKER_01]: community and that you bless us all with
your knowledge and passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much respect, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's comments like that that recharge me,
that keep me going, that make it all worth
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Knowing that I'm helping at least you
because I'm answering your question,
[SPEAKER_01]: but knowing that I'm helping people making
gardens better, making cannabis better as
[SPEAKER_01]: a whole, that means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reminders like this, those
recharge me and those keep me going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much respect back at you as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big fist bump.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it says, my question is, in the area
of white hairs, those are called pistols,
[SPEAKER_01]: my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the reproductive organ of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, is there a way to tell from the
hairs that the plant has been pollinated?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some cultivars do produce red
hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was wondering how I can tell the
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again for your time and passion and
aloha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big aloha, my brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about these pistols.
[SPEAKER_01]: About 14 to 21 to 28 to 32-ish days into
flower, your plant is going to be showing
[SPEAKER_01]: pistols.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the dandelion looking or the
cluster of those pistols looks like a
[SPEAKER_01]: dandelion forming on your ganja plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the start of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those little pistols are the reproductive
part of the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is number one goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think it's to get us high.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the bonus.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the side effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the number one goal of the cannabis
plant is to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wants to make more plants to continue
its life next year and then continue next
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis is number one goal is to
reproduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those white hairs are the reproductive
organ on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those hairs stick out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The male plants grow a little bit taller
than the females.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully they drop pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That pollen lands on that, that hair,
that pistol slides down that pistol into
[SPEAKER_01]: the ovule where a seed is formed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bract involved in there,
but we're just going to stick with the
[SPEAKER_01]: ovule into the bract.
[SPEAKER_01]: A seed is formed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the seeds will happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the question is how can I tell if the
plant has been pollinated by looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: the pistols?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once the plant is pollinated, so we'll say
the pistols are sticking up like my
[SPEAKER_01]: fingers, like I'm giving you a high five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shortly after pollination, they'll turn
kind of a brown color and start to crumple
[SPEAKER_01]: inside on themselves and just dry up and
wither away.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how to identify that they have been
pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it is true that a lot of plants do
produce red hairs, but that is later in
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once those hairs have turned red,
that plant has basically passed its prime
[SPEAKER_01]: point for pollination and it can no longer
receive pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Its lady parts are dried up basically and
it can no longer reproduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now most of the time I can tell the
difference between a dried up pistol that
[SPEAKER_01]: has been pollinated and a plant that has
gone beyond its time just by kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, there will be a seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's been pollinated, it will start
forming a seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't take very long from pollination
for the seeds to start forming.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see seeds in seven to ten days.
[SPEAKER_01]: They won't be chunky, fat, healthy seeds,
but you'll be able to identify that that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant has been pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when they get pollinated, they kind of
curl in and shrivel a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they go un-pollinated and they're left
just to die on their own and wither away,
[SPEAKER_01]: they kind of just die and stay not
withered and curled in, but a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: straighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do have curls and textures to them,
but they don't curl as badly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep saying the word curl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's exactly what to look for when
it like claws up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the pistols, they just fold in on
each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when they have been pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're still kind of long and wispy
like eyelashes, then they're probably not
pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the number one indicator, obviously,
is going to be the presence of a seed in
[SPEAKER_01]: that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now a lot of people are going to freak
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times, people send me messages.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say, hey bro, what do I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: My plants are filled with seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I say, let's investigate more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me a picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me a video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do some tricks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We go squeezing around on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We go looking around and we realize those
are not seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are swollen bracts, which is what we
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want the plant to get swollen calyxes,
big fat bracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the parts that we're going to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the flower cluster forming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every one of those little clusters makes a
big flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want that to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people freak out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They see at the nodes, right where the
leaf, the big petiole comes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes there's a little bract right at
the bottom of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: People really freak out and say,
I've got seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just a bract.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably don't have seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So look at the plants and you can tell if
they're big and white and fluffy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are ready for pollen and have not
been pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they get brown and curl in a little bit
like a cat claw, I guess, or like the like
[SPEAKER_01]: the yeah, it's a cat claw.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm making right there, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: They curl in like a girl on Instagram
trying to show you her fingernails.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they curl in like that, that makes
sense, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it's probably been pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they just die and lay across the bud
like that and they don't curl in like the
[SPEAKER_01]: cat claw, then they're probably just
expired pistols is what I would call them.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that point, I just made that phrase up
expired pistols.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that's even real.
[SPEAKER_01]: You heard it first here on the grow from
your heart podcast episode 800.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're making up new fucking words.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have fun with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I think I basically covered that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some cultivars cultivars produce
red hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that's going to be later in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you'll know you'll, you'll
probably, you should probably be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: tell the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't see any seeds or anything,
then it has not been pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just go ahead and give it a squeeze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go destroying your buds,
but give it a squeeze.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's a seed in there, it'll pop like
a P or it'll have some juices inside of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's not a seed, there won't be
anything inside of those bracts or
[SPEAKER_01]: calyxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, my buddy Chivo, thank you for
the great message.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do owe you a free pack of iry genetic
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, please do send me your
shipping info.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get those out to you right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I do owe you seeds as a prize,
cause I've read your message here on the
[SPEAKER_01]: show and I have not sent it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please be patient with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was overwhelmed with the four 20 sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just caught up with all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a lot of stuff going on,
but I will get your prizes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have no fear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, everybody does get their prizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it just takes a little bit of
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we're going to move into the
next question here on today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came from our friend Cronker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw how I think I would say that K R O
N.
[SPEAKER_01]: K O R that's Cronker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's what I'm calling you from now
on, but I hope that's how I say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this message says, yo Rasta Jeff,
I love your show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been watching since at least
2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of episodes, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also kind of embarrassing because I wasn't
a super good podcaster back then,
[SPEAKER_01]: but thank you for growing with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you noticed the growth and
improvements in the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're watching the video as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, then it goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, thank you for all of the
wonderful information you put into your
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said before, bro, that is the kind
of feedback and encouragement that I need
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep me inspired to do the shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says now onto my reason for writing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a few potential questions for you
to maybe answer on your podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have no fear.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dude, I'm going to answer your
questions right here on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a quick one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I've been wondering if you know,
if there are any benefits to watering
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plants with coffee leftover from
our morning, maybe not every morning,
[SPEAKER_01]: but sometimes my quick answer to that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, uh, the pH is way too acidic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You, I wouldn't do it because,
uh, we try to stay in a Pacific,
[SPEAKER_01]: a specific pH range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm certain that coffee is going to be
very acidic.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, when I drink coffee,
if tastes very acidic to me, I'm not even
[SPEAKER_01]: a huge coffee fan anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but it's too acidic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be my, that's the short
answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it says, uh, keeping with the coffee
questions, what about top dressing with
[SPEAKER_01]: coffee grounds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now my short answer was no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it says for these, for any of these
questions, does it matter if we use a
[SPEAKER_01]: coffee beans, if the coffee beans are
caffeinated or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you from your friend, Cronker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the final note that I wrote on this
paper was just drink the coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like you really enjoy coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like you really enjoy cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just roll up a fat joint of cannabis
and have a nice fat cup of coffee and
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoy them that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't see the benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you'll probably cause more harm
than you will benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you try to induce the coffee into the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand you want to be useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got these coffee grounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got some waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you really want to do it, I recommend
putting it into the compost bin,
[SPEAKER_01]: compost it, but otherwise you're just
going to totally disrupt the pH of your
[SPEAKER_01]: rhizosphere for your cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dude, Cronker, thank you for the great
message.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, send me your address so that I
can send you a pack of IRI genetics seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, that seed giveaway is sponsored
by my friends at seeds here now.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check out seeds here now.com
for regular feminized photo period,
[SPEAKER_01]: auto flower, any seeds you could imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are available at seeds here now.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them know Rasta.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff sent you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got another question right here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came from our friend fridge
Raider, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're telling me, bro, smoke a few dabs
and go raid the fridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a great name.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a general grow question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says Rasta.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff, I'm very excited and happy to have
your gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you're able to get your hands on
my gear, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been listening to the podcast for
at least a year now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pick up, I picked up a few packs from
you recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got nuketown, very great strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nuketown is Chernobyl to a golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I got chemical cocktail,
which is lemon chem to afterglow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got the maize, which is,
which is blue raspberry truffle to the
[SPEAKER_01]: reversed afterglow once again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a great lineup of strains that are
nuketown, chemical cocktail, and the
[SPEAKER_01]: maize.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I'm very excited, but I would be
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also very good strain selections.
[SPEAKER_01]: The chemical cocktail and the maize will
run beautifully together and they're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to have very different, very different
effects and flavors and aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nuketown will go well in there,
but it's going to be a little bit shorter
[SPEAKER_01]: than the other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're going to run those together,
I do the chemical cocktail and the maize
[SPEAKER_01]: and then consider the nuketown on a
different run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do your thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to run them all together,
it will work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the, the nuketown is going to grow a
little bit differently, more bushy,
[SPEAKER_01]: less tall than the other plants in the
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you can manage it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I'm very excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to preserve genetics by
cloning the issue is I've never cloned
[SPEAKER_01]: anything before and I've been through a
few runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's time to learn how to clone,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great step.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, I put out a wonderful
cloning podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a wonderful show.
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube didn't seem to think so because
after it got about 2000 views in just a
[SPEAKER_01]: few days, YouTube took the video down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my how to cut clones and cultivate
clones episode with a step-by-step video,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was clipping them, dipping them and
sticking them and getting them going.
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube took it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't refer you to my clone cutting
video.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope, and I'm sure there are several
other clone cutting videos out there on
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend watching a good video,
getting a good education on cloning,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm sad they took mine down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I digress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's keep moving here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, how would you recommend one to
clone without using a store bought tray
[SPEAKER_01]: and dome?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think about putting clones
into tap water to root?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's a, these plants are too high
performance, too valuable, too precious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we expect too much out of them to just
drop them into water and expect them to
[SPEAKER_01]: root.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may, some of your healthier plants
may root.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them are just going to shrivel up
and get rotten and die without some sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of movement, without some air in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want more than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they deserve more than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also say, also, what about putting
cuttings into reused soil to root using
[SPEAKER_01]: cups?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I understand what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to use a beer cup, like a solo
cup with holes in the bottom for drainage,
[SPEAKER_01]: then use a clear cup up top to work as a
humidity dome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far out of all of your ideas,
that is the best one that I think I would
[SPEAKER_01]: go with.
[SPEAKER_01]: You say that the store bought domes and
trays and everything are expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are super affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is the way to clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to get expensive, look into
buying a turbo cloner or an easy cloner
[SPEAKER_01]: with a manifold and a sprayer and a big
body and replaceable collars.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when cloning gets fucking
expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly think you could buy the cloning
dome and tray and some rapid rooters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to need, however you do
this, you're going to need some clone gel
[SPEAKER_01]: of some sort.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend the, or the purple clone X
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for the price of the cups you're
going to buy, depending on how many clones
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to make, you could probably buy
most of your clone dome set up for the
[SPEAKER_01]: same price.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to a hydroponic shop,
or if you even shop on Amazon,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you have to, you can get a dome and a
tray for about 15 bucks, probably get some
[SPEAKER_01]: rapid rooters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are going to run you about 30 bucks
for a bag of rapid rooters.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really not that much funding compared
to buying cups and hoping that they work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would encourage you to, encourage you to
set yourself up for success and do this
[SPEAKER_01]: the best way that you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand 45 bucks, maybe a lot of
money to somebody who isn't going to make
[SPEAKER_01]: any money off of these clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to wait at least 120 days before
there's any profit, any return on
[SPEAKER_01]: investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would just buy the tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would buy the dome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd buy some rapid rooters or something
similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have to be rapid rooters.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's root riots.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's fucking 20 different brands out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pick the one that's on sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all mostly reliable.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all close to the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just get the one that's on sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got the tray, maybe the insert,
you got a dome, you got some rapid
[SPEAKER_01]: rooters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some clone gel and then you need
scissors and then a way to label these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and maybe some alcohol to clean up
or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just invest a few bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I would totally recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it sounds like you own a business.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got some money.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're saying spend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely recommend it's going to be a
more enjoyable process.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have more pride in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to enjoy it more,
which means you'll make more time for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll put more effort into it,
which means you'll get a better product in
[SPEAKER_01]: the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So spend a few bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you spend money, then you're
going to work harder because you put money
[SPEAKER_01]: into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The shit's got to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other option was using recycled
soil, putting it into a beer cup and using
[SPEAKER_01]: a clear cup or maybe even a bag to cover
it, to keep the humidity in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't find a good dome and tray on
Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are expensive and weird sizes and
fragile.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll get them to you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazon will not destroy your clone dome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten plenty delivered in the mail
myself, allegedly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not that expensive in the
size.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get a 50 cutting tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only 14 inches long, 15.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's about 16 inches long by eight
or nine inches wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really not that big, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you just put the dome right on
top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you've already got a grow space
with a veg room, you can probably put
[SPEAKER_01]: these in the floor and the peripheral area
where the light goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't need a lot of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just spring for the good gear,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you insist on using soil and cups
and domes by using a cup or a baggie,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can absolutely do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But make sure you use that root gel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still recommend cutting them and putting
them in some sort of a root gel before you
[SPEAKER_01]: put them in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will encourage root growth much more
drastically than if you just put them in
[SPEAKER_01]: there without any sort of root hormone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if you decide to do this,
I would clean out that soil so it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: overloaded with nutrients that are going
to burn your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been feeding that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, maybe you flushed a little bit
at the end, but maybe you didn't get all
[SPEAKER_01]: the nutrients out of that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would rinse it out if you've got any
enzymatic products, some SLF 100,
[SPEAKER_01]: some hygrosyme, something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would run a little bit of enzymes,
mix it in water and run the enzymes
[SPEAKER_01]: through that soil to help you flush it
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way, it's fresh and clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no pathogens, no problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because basically, think of it like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we cut clones, we are severing a limb
off of that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like me to just cut your arm off
and stick your arm into just some random
[SPEAKER_01]: dirty dirt and hope there's no pathogens
that take over and prevent you from
[SPEAKER_01]: growing your arm?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or would you rather me give you some sort
of sterile environment with a chance?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it was my arm, bro, I would definitely
recommend that sterile environment and get
[SPEAKER_01]: a chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I understand budget may be the key
issue here in the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use that recycled soil,
but rinse it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you put holes in that bottom cup
so the water can drain out of the dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then if you put a clear cup or a baggie on
top, make sure you just seal it up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you're going to have to learn how to
adjust the airflow to that after a few
[SPEAKER_01]: days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to need some air.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a cup, you could poke holes
in the cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: The baggie, I'm not sure what you're going
to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your idea will work, but you wouldn't be,
you will be much more successful if you
[SPEAKER_01]: just spring for the dome, the divider
thing, the little insert that holds the
[SPEAKER_01]: plugs, the plugs and the tray part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said that backwards, the tray,
the insert, the plugs on the dome,
[SPEAKER_01]: and maybe like a spray bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could spray them to keep them
moist.
[SPEAKER_01]: That always helps you out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, some clone X gel for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need some kind of cloning
gel and clean scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you clean the scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's definitely important, but I think
you can make this happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my advice is just spring for the
proper equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Set yourself up for a success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy the grow a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Invest in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to spend that 45 bucks on
silly shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, go ahead and put it into the
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will reward you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy, Fridge Raider.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to thank you for the great
message.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for getting me to ramble for a
few minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, you have won a free pack of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please do send me your address.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot wait to get you a free pack of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once again, that free seed giveaway is
sponsored by my friends at seeds here now
[SPEAKER_01]: .com.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got one more message here in front of
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This message also came from the irie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Genetics grow help tab on irie genetics
.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came from our friend,
Sean from Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: What up, Sean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to meet you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You of course do win a free pack of irie
genetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please send me your shipping address.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I wait to get you a free pack of beans
and get those in your garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: Our friend, Sean has a general grow
question that goes just like this and
[SPEAKER_01]: says, hi Ross to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Sean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I have a quick breeding question
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody knows those are my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I have a plant I want to breed
with, and it was from a feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it okay to use SDS to make her the
pollen donor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, would it be okay to then pollinate
another feminized plant with that pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: donor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you in advance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate all the info you could bless
me with, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have done this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: What strain do I use that is feminized?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's pick something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, lemon sorbet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody else has used the name lemon
sorbet since then, but a long time ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: a very, very long time ago, before the
rain and before the snow, I took my
[SPEAKER_01]: grateful dog, which is a feminized seed
project.
[SPEAKER_01]: That plant is a feminized plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I reversed grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put that pollen on lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lemon Jeffrey is a feminized project from
that reversed pollen from a reversed from
[SPEAKER_01]: a female plant, put that pollen on another
plant that came from a fem seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what it made?
[SPEAKER_01]: It made fucking hot fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of my favorite crosses that I
have never put out.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first made that cross, I put out a
bunch of tester seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right after I did it, my social media
account got squashed and I lost contact
[SPEAKER_01]: with a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was very discouraged.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost excitement for that cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I put all the seeds in the vault and I've
never let them go to anybody other than
[SPEAKER_01]: those testers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a few of them left myself at the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to call them a lemon sorbet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure somebody has taken that
name by now, but it was a grateful dog
[SPEAKER_01]: reversed onto the lemon Jeffrey and both
of those are feminized and it made amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, you can do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes if we go too far with
generations of selfing a plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: things can go weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we do like S two or S three,
sometimes we start going the wrong
[SPEAKER_01]: direction and losing vigor and losing the
quality traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we start seeing slow weak plants,
but most of the time taking a feminized
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and a feminized plant that are not
related to each other, that have not been
[SPEAKER_01]: inbred, that have not been worked
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you breed those together.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a new F one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a new S one or an R one,
whichever one you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that new F one is going to have
hybrid, hybrid vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I definitely recommend that sort of a
project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So have no fear, grow your fem seeds,
reverse your fem seeds, breed with your
[SPEAKER_01]: fem seeds, have fun with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most important part is to pay
attention to what happens to the progeny.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to grow those out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you're going to make some wonky
shit, but sometimes you're going to make
[SPEAKER_01]: some amazing shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the time that'll come out just
like you anticipate.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could see the traits, they come
from plant A and the traits that come from
[SPEAKER_01]: plant B.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, you've grown them enough
times and you've identified what they do
[SPEAKER_01]: when you breed them, when you reverse one
and pollinate the other, you can easily
[SPEAKER_01]: predict what they're going to do if you've
developed a relationship with both plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I recommend breeding with regulars,
fems, breed, breed, breed, have a good
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the great question,
my dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, please do send me your address
so I can send you a free pack of IRI
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends,
[SPEAKER_01]: foes, smokers, growers, clone cutters,
Paul and Chuckers, all of you beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis activists out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to thank you once again for
joining me for an episode 800 of the Grow
[SPEAKER_01]: From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels really good to say 800 episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That puts some, some pride inside of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puts a smile on my face, puts a new spark
in me for podcasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also a new spark.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you guys have been enjoying the new
format.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been trying to cut out some of the
nonsense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cut out the advertising and the shout
outs at the front of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to get in, give you guys the info
you need and get out so that you guys can
[SPEAKER_01]: learn some stuff and not have to listen to
me ramble for too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do enjoy the rambles, check out my
Instagram live show every Monday.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every Monday around 7, 10 PM mountain
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go on Instagram live.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Iri underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have to type in the whole name to
find me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Set your notifications Monday night.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go live.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I get rambly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll smoke a bunch of dabs and just talk a
bunch of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll listen to reggae music.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about growing ganja.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about music.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about sneakers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows what we might say on the Monday
