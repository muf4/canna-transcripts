[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a delicious dab of Bounce Full
Spectrum Extract from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of Headbanger and Secret
Cush Mints.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, the flavor is described as
sour, gas, and pine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've talked about this
concentrate on the show before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is certainly Rostageff approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is delicious and it is potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back of the package, it says the
product contains 72.16% THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-detectable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very high THC, very low CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is right up my alley.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff tastes delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hits really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice and smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a big four-gram jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm popping it open to take another fresh
look.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ratio of sauce to diamonds in this
container was perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really approve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am really impressed with the Bounce Full
Spectrum Extract from my friends at Green
[SPEAKER_00]: Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be
a fun episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I am going to do a strain
description.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to talk about a strain that I
bred called Sonic Boom.

[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
let's jump into the fun part of this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you know that I am a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the sole breeder and the sole
proprietor for iReGenetics premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make regular and feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not make auto flower seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people ask me about autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have nothing against autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just not my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work on feminized and regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like really terpy, high THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 63 to 70 day flowering sativa
dominant hybrids is kind of what I like to
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my stuff finishes a little
earlier, but everything is really terpy
[SPEAKER_00]: and really potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is mainly what I'm going for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this episode, we are going to focus
on a strain that I bred that I have named
[SPEAKER_00]: Sonic Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into it and talk about
Sonic Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the parents of Sonic Boom?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sonic Boom is a cross of lemon OG haze
from the ethos collective crossed to my
[SPEAKER_00]: arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk briefly about the lemon OG
haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon OG haze comes from ethos and it is a
cross of super lemon haze to ethos OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fell in love with it when I ran a
commercial cultivation facility here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved the way the plant grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved the way the plant smelled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved the way the plant smoked and I
loved the buzz I got when I smoked the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers and the concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I quickly fell in love with the lemon
OG haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a lot of great photos of the lemon
OG haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually sent a few of them to Colin
from ethos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at some of the old
packaging for the lemon OG haze,
[SPEAKER_00]: that real dark purple bud with the purple
leaves on there, that is actually my
[SPEAKER_00]: photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've grown a lot of lemon OG haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of experience with it and
it is a wonderful plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon OG haze grows very quickly in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also grows very rapidly in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: In one flower room where I ran the lemon
OG haze, I would have three of every other
[SPEAKER_00]: plant in a row and I would only have two
lemon OG haze plants because they would
[SPEAKER_00]: fill up the equal amount of space of three
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was able to fill more space with less
plants because it grows so quickly and
[SPEAKER_00]: makes such large plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also grows quickly in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also takes very well to stretching and
topping and bending it around and
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also put out very reliable harvest
numbers in all aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: By that I mean it put out good weights.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first number you think about
when it comes to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much did it weigh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to be able to pay the bills
and keep the grow open?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it did that every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also put out amazing numbers on the lab
reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many consumers base their shopping on the
potency test on the jar at the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: That lemon OG haze would always give us
amazing potency results from the lab so
[SPEAKER_00]: that always worked well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a lot of it and a lot of potency so
it would sell which keeps us in business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I quickly fell in love with the lemon
OG haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to happen when a breeder
falls in love with the female plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: My next step is obviously to introduce it
to a male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I chose to introduce the lemon OG haze to
my male, which I call King Solomon,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a select Arise male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk briefly about my male because
I've gone over this guy in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: conversations and a lot of podcast
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll cover them quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise is a female golden goat plant
pollinated by a daybreaker male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daybreaker is Chem D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem D and Joseph OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem D and Joseph OG bring a funky,
chemically, gassy, some people say fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: rubber, some people say burnt rubber.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely got some feet and some
funk to it and a little bit of skunky
[SPEAKER_00]: aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that side of the palette from the
daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Chem D and Joseph OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other side of the cross is golden
goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That brings a sweet tropical flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bred this sweet tropical to that earthy,
gassy, funky tennis ball thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it made a wonderful cross,
which is known as Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a full podcast episode on Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find that in a quick search.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to focus more on the cross
that came from that today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Arise was the male that I used in
this cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used that male because he is known to
pass on vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: He creates what I call hyper vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The progeny that come from King Solomon
always grow super quickly in veg and
[SPEAKER_00]: rapidly in flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know he passes on that vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also know that he passes on a lot of
potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I have pollinated with King
Solomon has created more potent plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The progeny has come out more potent than
the mother plants that I started with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is always a goal, always a good
thing when you are breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's known to increase vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is known to increase potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that I know this male is
good for is he passes on very resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants that come from this male do not
get powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not get bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So King Solomon is a very reliable
breeding stud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have chosen to hit the Lemon OG Haze
with my King Solomon pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resulting progeny were called Sonic
Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's focus more on the actual Sonic
Boom strain itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mainly made this cross because I loved
the flavor and aroma of the Lemon OG Haze
[SPEAKER_00]: and I loved the potency, but I knew I
could make it more potent and I wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: something in my lineup with that Lemon
Lime Gatorade sort of a flavor and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon OG Haze just spoke to me every time
I walked past the plant in the commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once I acquired clones of it,
those clones just spoke to me every time I
[SPEAKER_00]: would walk by them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew it needed to be pollinated by King
Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just knew that it would make amazing
flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew it would make big vigorous plants
and I knew that those plants would put out
[SPEAKER_00]: great numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to make the cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cross came out exactly how I hoped and
expected it would turn out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the phenotypes are dominated by
the Lemon OG Haze flavors and aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are dominated by a Lemon Lime
Gatorade sort of a flavor with some lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: candies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I think it kind of smells like a
margarita mix on the middle of the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may catch some grapefruits and a lot
of the phenotypes are going to have hints
[SPEAKER_00]: of fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really believe that the fuel is coming
from the OG side of the Lemon OG Haze,
[SPEAKER_00]: also coming from that Chem D and the
Joseph OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the phenotypes have really
been dominated by that Lemon OG Haze Lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: Lime Gatorade, some kind of green Gatorade
or green sports drink kind of a flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it gets real pungent, it kind of
turns into a margarita mix, that lime
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor and sort of a little wang comes out
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think it smells great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the hints of fuel come in from that
day breaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you dry it and cure it and smoke
it, a little bit more of that funk comes
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really maintains that lemon candy,
lemon flavor, that margarita mix aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when you smoke it, you get like
also, I like to say a little hint of foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's always coming from the Joseph
OG side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it possibly is coming a little bit
from the OG Kush thing in the Lemon OG
[SPEAKER_00]: Haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that covers the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, lemon, lime, Gatorade,
margarita mix, lemon lime candies,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then some funkiness in the background
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you exhale that funkiness,
it'll kind of linger on your tongue,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the room smells more like lemons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my description of the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buzz is tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep talking about high potency crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: King Solomon makes everything really
potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an Arise cut that reliably tests
in the mid 30s at different labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: My Arise number four female that I have
selected, she's labeled number four
[SPEAKER_00]: because she was number four in a batch of
seeds that I grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew several batches and that batch,
she happened to be number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes one of my favorite keepers was
Arise E for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just used letters that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time it was Arise number four is the
one I've been keeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I play with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: She really hits really high test numbers
in many different situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lab test right here in front of
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made sure to pull it up on my phone so I
can read it accurately.
[SPEAKER_00]: This says 35.84% THC-A, and that is coming
from my Arise number four female.
[SPEAKER_00]: The male plant that I use in my cross is
called Lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a high potency cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a high potency cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a high potency cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has got the same potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that potential really came
through in this cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Ojihaise produces highly potent
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you flower these long enough and you
chop them down at the right time and you
[SPEAKER_00]: dry and cure them, you will have highly
potent cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be very medicinal product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you make concentrates out of these
plants, you are going to have amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some flowers, some concentrates,
I can smoke and smoke and smoke and I get
[SPEAKER_00]: to this point where I say I'm saturated or
I'm maxed out or I've reached the limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how stoned I'm going to get
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no going past that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you've been smoking for as long
as somebody like myself or a lot of other
[SPEAKER_00]: people, a lot of medical patients,
we saturate ourselves on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to this limit and that's as high
as your mind and your body are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: let you get no matter how much more you
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like when I smoke lemon OG haze,
I can always top it just a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always that one more like,
oh shit, I can get that high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it high school high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember in high school when you would
smoke and you'd get so high that nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: knew you smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for some reason, you thought everybody
in a hundred mile radius got a letter in
[SPEAKER_00]: the mail that said you just smoked a fat
joint and they all need to stare at you
[SPEAKER_00]: and laugh at you and make you feel
uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of that shit was happening,
but in your head, you thought everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: was looking at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You thought you had crumbs on your shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You thought you smelled funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: You thought you heard a dog barking in the
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of that shit was happening,
but your brain was fucking with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sonic Boom can still get me to that point
at this point in the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been smoking forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's a night where I'm lit and
I've just maxed out, I've had my quota of
[SPEAKER_00]: fat dabs or fat joints or whatever,
I can still turn to the Sonic Boom and
[SPEAKER_00]: take a fat dab or smoke a couple of bowls
and I can still reach that next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can still get nicely medicated or good
and high or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's still another band to watch or
if there's another comedian or if there's
[SPEAKER_00]: something else that I want to get stoned
again for, I can do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because once you've medicated a few times
a day and you're trying to get stoned at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the night, sometimes it just
doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you're at that point,
I feel like the Sonic Boom will be the
[SPEAKER_00]: strain that will help you get another buzz
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is limitless, I feel like.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start smoking Sonic Boom,
you can keep going and it is limitless.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will give you giggles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will get an intense head high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get that like paranoid kind of tunnel
vision thing to where you're looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: your sunglasses, but they are on your
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to turn down the music so
that you can see the traffic better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those kind of herbs that make
the music too loud, but it's not really
[SPEAKER_00]: that loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually the air conditioner that
was too loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that kind of herb that makes you
disoriented and confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, that's what I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can give some folks a little bit of
discomfort, kind of panicky.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really love the intense,
intense head high that comes from Sonic
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have covered the consumption part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's focus more on the cultivation
aspects of Sonic Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sonic Boom is a very fast vegging plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also very vigorous in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will get fairly tall on you,
but not extremely tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of my stuff will get what I call
extremely tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will double or triple in height by the
time it is done flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sonic Boom does have the potential to
double in height throughout the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sonic Boom likes to make tall,
branchy plants, but it makes a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: branches with a lot of bud sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the things I love about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you clean up the bottoms of those
branches and just leave the few six or
[SPEAKER_00]: eight inches on the tip with foliage and
with bud sites on there, you will get
[SPEAKER_00]: long, ridiculous colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean up the bottom stuff, send that
energy up to the top, and you get amazing,
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing colas from the Sonic Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are tall, branchy, fast growing
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have medium stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before, it has the potential
to double its height in the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most phenotypes you will find finish
within 63 to 72 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there will be outliers on both
directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are rarely earlier finishers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are more common to find a little bit
longer finisher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the 75-day mark is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like a 65-day finisher on the
Sonic Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got nice, tight buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that aroma, and it's just as
potent as you need it around 65 days if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got that phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sonic Boom makes lots of bright green
colorful buds, bright greens, bright
[SPEAKER_00]: orange pistils, really beautiful buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very photogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're into taking pictures of flowers
and you like those bright green buds with
[SPEAKER_00]: really bright green leaves, lime green
leaves, and then accented by bright orange
[SPEAKER_00]: pistils, you will love the photos that
come from your Sonic Boom plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll also love the giant buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will look really good in photos,
but they are going to need some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying how quickly and vigorously
this plant grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will make giant colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are going to need some sort of
supports.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants like being trellised and
netted and put in tomato cages and
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulated and topped and twisted and
bent around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will take all of the abuse you can
give them, and they will spring back and
[SPEAKER_00]: laugh at you like nothing even happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like using a net to spread out a
Sonic Boom plant, spread it out really
[SPEAKER_00]: far, then let it veg up through the net
just a little bit, put a net up above that
[SPEAKER_00]: one, let it stretch into that net and then
flower it and then put up another net and
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly another net for those giant buds
to grow into.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not using trellising,
you will need some sort of sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy the tall sticks because these plants
are going to get tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't like having a bunch of sticks
in the room because it does become an eye
[SPEAKER_00]: hazard, a lot of people have poked their
eyes on those bamboo sticks in the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to use those,
maybe you can use a tomato cage,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I do recommend some sort of support
system for these plants because they are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get big buds that will be very
top heavy and they will fall over and
[SPEAKER_00]: break your branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most phenotypes of Sonic Boom will react
very well to being topped.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most cases, when you top it,
it is going to take off and grow rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to run a quick crop that will
be potent, vigorous and have a very nice
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest weight, I recommend a few Sonic
Boom plants in three gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't top them, veg them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they're about knee high, flower them
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put about nine of those under a
thousand watt light in a five by five
[SPEAKER_00]: tent, you will have a beautiful harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got more space, I absolutely
recommend going with larger pots and
[SPEAKER_00]: topping the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get very branchy, very bushy
plants from the Sonic Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It loves to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you top it, it just shows off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh yeah, you think so?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just makes more branching and goes
crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: She likes to make really long branches
with minimal space between bud sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have learned that if I clean up the
bottoms of those branches, but don't take
[SPEAKER_00]: off the branches and still leave the ends
to where they can develop buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of those branches develop giant bud
sites if they are allowed to get enough
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trellis it out, clean up the bottom of
it, get all of those long branches to
[SPEAKER_00]: reach the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when every branch has reached the
screen, when you flower it out,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of those little branches will create
nice, decent sized colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the big tops will create amazing,
impressive colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something about Sonic Boom just makes
these plants want to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you manipulate them, when you
bully them, when you try to slow them
[SPEAKER_00]: down, they just go, yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch what I can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that these plants respond
very well to is popping and twisting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk a lot about popping and twisting my
branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called super cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's known as a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do it for several reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, it's slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, it slows down my stretch and
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants are being popped and
twisted and cracked during the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: phase, they're going to spend energy
repairing that cracking and twisting and
[SPEAKER_00]: that broken cellulose fiber, and they
won't be able to stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first three weeks of flower,
I do a lot of popping and twisting and
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulating of the branches just to slow
down that 21 day stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think popping and twisting makes
bigger, more robust stalks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice that everywhere you pop it,
you've created a little knuckle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those knuckles are sturdier than the
sections without knuckles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really knurl up my plants quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pop as much as I can, create as many
knuckles as I can on every plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: then clean up that lower part,
clean up the bottoms of the branches,
[SPEAKER_00]: take off all the little sucker branches,
take off all the little shitty shoots,
[SPEAKER_00]: just leave the big tops, trellis it out
real far.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will have amazing, impressive harvest
and results with the Sonic Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's focus more on some phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a note that says, the skinny
leaves are the lemon lime turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very accurate in my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The skinnier the leaves, the more lemon
lime flavor you are going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those bigger leaves, you start getting
these OG Kush gassy or funkier flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is obvious that when we go to the
skinnier leaves, we are leaning more
[SPEAKER_00]: toward the lemon haze and the golden goat
in the cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we get the bigger leaves,
obviously we're bringing out the OG Kush,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Chem D and the Joseph OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were looking for that lemon
lime, maybe that margarita mix flavor,
[SPEAKER_00]: look more toward the skinnier-leaved
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind that it kind of makes
sense that those skinnier-leaved
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes are also possibly going to take
a little bit longer to finish than the
[SPEAKER_00]: broader-leaved phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be more sativa dominant,
so they will take a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe give those closer to 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe give them that 70, 72, possibly 75
days to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the phenotypes that you find will
produce very dense buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the phenotypes will be very
frosty, and most of them will have that
[SPEAKER_00]: margarita mix lemon-lime-gatorade sort of
a flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main differences you will see in
phenotypes are obviously the skinnier
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves and the larger leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the skinnier ones,
like I've said, make that lime flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bigger leaves make that sort of a
funky fresh rubber or burnt rubber or a
[SPEAKER_00]: tennis ball and a gassy-fuely sort of a
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously the wider-leaved phenotype
will finish earlier, but you'll also
[SPEAKER_00]: notice a phenotype that has big leaves
that stay droopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not a problem with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a trait that comes from
Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very fun plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get gassy, cushy tennis
balls with margarita mix on top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is kind of a rare and unique
phenotype, but that one does pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also one that I believe has a lot
of island sweet skunk in it that takes a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thing is super potent, but it will
take a while to finish, and it will have
[SPEAKER_00]: this lemon grapefruit sort of a flavor to
it, and it may have pink pistils.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see pink pistils, you have got the
island sweet skunk grapefruit phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in my experience, all of these
phenotypes are desirable because I love
[SPEAKER_00]: the buzz that comes from all of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these plants also are going to
demand high nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants like a lot of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend feeding the shit out of these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also always recommend pushing your
plants a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feed them what you're used to feeding
them, and pay attention to the tips of the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it getting their nails done.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it looks like the tips of the leaves
are just starting to get burnt or just
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to curl a little bit,
that is right where you want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pull back a little bit if you want
or just keep feeding just like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and your plants will give you their
optimal performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really feel like Sonic Boom really
performs well when you feed her a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is really hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Lemon OG is a really vigorous,
fast-growing plant that eats a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen, and of course, it's got Golden
Goat on the other side of the cross,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is almost always macronutrient
deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be in there with your macronutrients
and be prepared to give those plants a
[SPEAKER_00]: boost when they need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that is my strain review of
Sonic Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a very vigorous, very fast-growing,
very large plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes very Gatorade-type lemon-lime
sports drink, maybe a margarita mix,
[SPEAKER_00]: flavored kind of a bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it makes amazing concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be prepared for big plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I keep saying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant will do wonderfully indoors if
you give it the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will do beautifully in a greenhouse
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've got a nice condition
outdoors where these plants will finish on
[SPEAKER_00]: time, I would allow them 65 days outside,
and you will have giant, frosty,
[SPEAKER_00]: delicious, beautiful plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more thing I should mention,
one note that I overlooked because I got
[SPEAKER_00]: way ahead of myself is, Sonic Boom is very
tolerant of high humidity conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're struggling with your VPD,
Sonic Boom may work in your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got those skinny leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: She doesn't get powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: She doesn't get pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is great for high humidity
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and foes, smokers and growers,
clone cutters and pollen chuckers,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the next step is to let you know
where to pick up a pack of Sonic Boom
