[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, podcast world?
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to episode 526 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today we are doing something new.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, joining me on Zoom, we have got
White Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, man?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, thanks for joining me in these weird
COVID times.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the bunker.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the bunker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what you're going to call it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You got an official name for your
recording spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is now the bunker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did need to, but I just threw that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is going to be fun,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got Mike some recording gear.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's finally found some time.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got the, did you set dates?
[SPEAKER_02]: Those kids, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is that natural?
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't nap today and I ran them hard
this evening and just let them run around
[SPEAKER_01]: in the backyard and go ape shit right
until bedtime.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully we can do this once a week or so
and get you dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got at least three hours of them
sleeping, but they will be going hard at 7
[SPEAKER_01]: a.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: So does that mean three hours show from
the bunker?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what you just said?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to learn how to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So far, I feel like we're comfortable.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may be a little bit louder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I'll just turn myself down a bit
and I think we'll fucking even out.
[SPEAKER_02]: This would be a good time, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: So welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, thanks for the audio folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're we're trying something new.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure most of the people listening,
we got to keep in mind it's a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will live forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the people listening currently are
aware that we are under stay at home
[SPEAKER_02]: orders from our government.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, please stay home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Help us out.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a virus spreading and it is
causing hysteria and illness and death.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've been asked to stay home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike lives across town and he's also got
two young children and a family.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mike doesn't need to get me sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need to get Mike and his kids
sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to be good citizens.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to stay at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to do some shows from Zoom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure most of the people are doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're going to get creative here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure most of the people are doing shit
from home.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be excited just to have
content while they're on the home stay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like Mike said, if we do get any weird
audio glitches, we'll get it figured out.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is our first time trying this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Forgive us our trespasses.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm pretty good at tech gear and
editing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll make this sound all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds great in my headphones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds good in my head, but who knows
what it's doing in the recording gear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we should look at that and see that
that's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, that looks good too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're recording a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, congrats.

[SPEAKER_02]: Bro, I pulled that off with no notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have any cards or anything out of
the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I do that in my sleep sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wake up doing a Seeds Here Now at Buy
Seeds at Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you smoking on over there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Bro, I saw you take a big fat dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you got?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got all sorts of goodies right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just went on a resupply run to
Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the last one was some Blackberry
Banana Kush Ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went specifically for more of the Sour
Diesel Ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gone through a couple of grams of
that in quarantine and had to go re-up and
[SPEAKER_01]: ended up coming home with a lot more hash
than I intended to buy, which happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't going to bring up that you went
in?
[SPEAKER_02]: When you shopped, bro, you went
uncharacteristic.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a hard word for my face to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was unlike you.
[SPEAKER_02]: How hard you went in your shopping spree
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of chuckled.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been good for quarantine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've really only left the house once or
twice since the end of March.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them was a donut run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: On my birthday, I wanted a donut for
breakfast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said, fuck it and went and made a
donut run as safe as I could.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of podcast listeners just told you
happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_02]: So happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Way late, but happy birthday, Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, y'all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you went shopping.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to segue right into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I'm going to tell everybody what
I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also am smoking Apothecary Farms
Concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just hit Malibu Pure Kush Ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_02]: The package says 72.9% THC, 84.7% total
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Malibu Pure Kush tastes like Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that sounds like a stupid ass
description if you're not a Kush smoker,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it is exactly what I expect from a
good Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got that earthy, funky nastiness and
the Malibu has a little sweetness to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to ask about your shopping
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said you went to the dispensary today.
[SPEAKER_02]: How was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: How did it happen and how different is it
from normal?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm shopping meds, so meds still allowed
in the store.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was basically a normal shopping run
only I was in a mask, which was odd.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the compliance guy for a long time,
for a couple different outfits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the different rules we play by here
in Colorado are kind of always in my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: And having my face covered the whole time,
it was just alarm bells going off in my
[SPEAKER_01]: head like, oh, rule seven, rule seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a real thing, but anybody who
deals with the med knows what I'm talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want your ID checked two or three
times in the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you check in, the guy at the door or
the gal at the door or the non-binary
[SPEAKER_02]: gendered person at the door checks in your
ID and they go, oh, that's you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like you.
[SPEAKER_02]: The eye color, the height, the fucking
hair color, but the hair color doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: even matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we've all got, everyone's got fucking
rainbow hair, but the eyes and the fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: height look kind of like you.
[SPEAKER_02]: The picture looks like you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says you're old enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can shop in our store.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then when you go back to shop,
they pass your ID to the person who is
[SPEAKER_02]: serving you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call them a bud tender and they verify
you again, just because if they sell to
[SPEAKER_02]: you and you're not old enough or you're
not a medical marijuana patient,
[SPEAKER_02]: they can, they're being charged with a
crime.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just illegally sold a controlled
substance to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they double check that ID.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be a hundred grand in this shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be people in jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got friends who have ended up in
jail because of weird stings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of the increased penalties,
the compliance rate is over 90%.
[SPEAKER_01]: For comparison with tobacco, it's usually
in the high eighties or mid to high
[SPEAKER_01]: eighties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're several points up with the
increase for the cannabis sales because
[SPEAKER_01]: the rules are harsher.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're in the dispensary, you've got
gloves, you've got a mask.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't glove up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, however, carrying a disinfecting
wipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it was, uh, other than the mask,
it was a pretty normal shopping trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a 419 as we're recording this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 420 Eve.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bro in six minutes, it's going to be 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just looked at the clock.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were recording it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be five minutes away till
420 now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheers brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that in, this being the first time I've
left the house in like 18 days,
[SPEAKER_01]: 19 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I kind of went a little nutty and was
like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I came for those two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me one of them, one of them,
one of them, one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I was good on flour, but I've got more
flour coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today was just a hash run.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've already seen your flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Haha.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to see it first and it smells really
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to the grower that got your
flour going.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knows who he is and it smells really
delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a friend help me out with some
flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today and Mike's going to get some of the
help and he's going to love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells really great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dispensaries are different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been to, uh, if you watch the
recreational.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you were there today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was glad I was shopping med because
there was no line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the rec line was substantial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, everybody in their cars, I didn't
count the cars, but there were more than a
[SPEAKER_01]: few.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you said in their cars, they're not
allowed to go inside the store now,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all, uh, they're doing all drive up
at the store I was at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got to, I had a friend who went
to the phone in your order.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to call it in, tell that you go to
weed maps.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd map shows the current menu.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got good pictures of the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go to weed maps, see what you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: You write down a little list.
[SPEAKER_02]: You give them a call.
[SPEAKER_02]: You say, Hey, I want this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they tell you come in 15 to 30
minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you go, they ask you your
name and they've got it bagged up with a
[SPEAKER_02]: receipt, stapled to the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: You give them cash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, they run inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would come out with your change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, honestly, you just tell them,
keep the change.
[SPEAKER_02]: You try to math it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's fucking a hundred bucks,
you give them a one 20 or one 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: You tell them, have a good day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you send them on their way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, then they bring out your bag and you
don't even have to get out of the car
[SPEAKER_02]: right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I wish I kind of wish they could
keep it like that forever because that
[SPEAKER_02]: would just make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we legalized cannabis in Colorado,
we agreed to a lot of rules just to
[SPEAKER_01]: placate the people who were against us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We agreed to a lot of over and above.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I think a lot of that is going to
get dialed back during this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's going to be one of the
little fucked up silver linings locked
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think we're going to slowly,
you know, as we come out of this,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the rules we changed to deal with
this, they're going to have to justify
[SPEAKER_01]: going back to the way it was like curbside
pickup at dispensaries is wonderfully
[SPEAKER_01]: convenient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, as a parent, it's kind of a pain in
the ass because I've, if I'm out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: house, there's an 80% chance I've got kids
in the back of the car.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I can't take kids into a
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: They physically can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enter the building.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it's not like there's consumption
happening there because nobody's got a
[SPEAKER_01]: tasting room permit yet, but, uh,
it's, it's always been sort of an over and
[SPEAKER_01]: above rule we've dealt with and the
curbside pickup gets around that so well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your kids are the age now to where you
can take them to the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long until you think that runs out?
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on the communication between
you and your kids as things evolve,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like I'm not really like they know
about the world and cannabis is in the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like, as they grow up, it's just
going to be like, that's the thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: adults do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a, that's a, I never thought of,
I haven't put my brain in that
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective, but the kids after my
daughter, my daughter's 16, the kids after
[SPEAKER_02]: that are going to grow up with normalized
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be just like when,
uh, whoever used to stop on the way to the
[SPEAKER_02]: beach or on the way to wherever and grab a
six pack of beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you stop and grab a couple of pre-roll
pre-rolls or an eighth or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just part of life now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you opened my brain to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: My belief on the subject is kind of based
on my interpretation of when I first found
[SPEAKER_01]: out about pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, wait, what do you mean you
kept it secret until now?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's all kinds of dangerous shit
you don't want me doing in the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like this one was a secret till now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why I've got to get my hands on some of
this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I want to see what happens to
society when that goes away, when it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just like, Oh, what are those guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there's a thing in the world called
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you smoke it, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And adults do it just like beer or just
like bungee jumping or whatever else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's all kinds of shit that adults
do that kids shouldn't take all the
[SPEAKER_02]: weirdness away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's part of why, um, I wasn't
super, I was never afraid of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up, you guys have heard about my
uncles on the podcast several times.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just used to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just grew up like it was,
that's just what you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like before you go to the baseball game,
you fucking burn one down in the car.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's so fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've come so far since we were kids is
like things we can get away with doing
[SPEAKER_01]: around each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's a great picture that goes
around on Facebook of like an eight year
[SPEAKER_01]: old blowing out the candles on their cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's like six beers and an ashtray
and a cigar and like three cigarettes in
[SPEAKER_01]: the frame, all right around on top of this
kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't do any of that now,
but when we were kids, it was common.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I've had a number of stories that
involve me getting accidentally burned by
[SPEAKER_01]: a cigarette just because smokers were
everywhere around kids and being a kid,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd sometimes wander into a lit
cigarette.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Used to smoke in the mall and the store
and the restaurant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They used to have a smoking section in the
restaurant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It used to be ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, we're telling everybody how old we
are right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is fucking weird son, like two old
crazy fucking men.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also congrats.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long have you been smoking?
[SPEAKER_02]: How long are you on cigarette freeness?
[SPEAKER_01]: Since January 22nd.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like three months, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Congrats.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like close to 90 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking rad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I switched to Tootsie Pops.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I said it because I saw you
pull the Tootsie Pop out and set it down
[SPEAKER_02]: in what should be the ashtray,
but it's now the Tootsie Roll pop holder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey dude, things got hairy for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: The shipment was late.
[SPEAKER_01]: My Tootsie Pops almost didn't come in and
I was like, fuck am I gonna do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Scratching your neck over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Y 'all got some of them Tootsie Pops.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking funny, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to interrupt the show because we
normally do some shout outs to our friends
[SPEAKER_02]: who support the show on Patreon at the top
of the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did not do that, but I love them and
you're taking a drink and it's a really
[SPEAKER_02]: good time to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually I do something silly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We roll up fat digital blunts.
[SPEAKER_02]: We pack up digital bong rips and we pass
them to our friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how about we do it like this?
[SPEAKER_02]: All of my friends in this episode are
going to get a big digital dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's start off with a big shout out to
my buddy, Cali Canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's follow that up with a big shout out
to my friend, Freakfish.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to send some love to our friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about a big high five and a fist bump
to Mark Moskal?
[SPEAKER_02]: How about a big high five to Gregory
Segura?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I shouldn't be saying everybody's
full names.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why I wrote down full names
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was fucking awkward.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about a big shout out to Eric Ross?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's send him to some.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope your wife knows you're fucking
contributing to Patreon.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about some love to Nora Cal Irie?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's send a big shout out to Ryan S.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to send some love to Spruce Hill
Farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And last but not least, how about a big
shout out to Tanner M.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I'm high and stumbling and got
fucking laughing.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the fact that I read everybody's full
name out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to all of our friends who do
support the show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do appreciate the support.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is how Mike got recording gear.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys on Patreon funded Mike's
recording equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I say thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike is unmuting his gear to say thank
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been having fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: We took a couple of zoom sessions and
chatted to get used to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're getting good at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, if you are not, yeah,
Mike, you're fucking good at this where
[SPEAKER_02]: you're like a fucking a pro already.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not already subscribed to my
Patreon campaign and you would like to
[SPEAKER_02]: learn how to support the show,
all you have to do is visit www.patreon
[SPEAKER_02]: .com forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did include a link in the show notes
because I like to make it easy for my
[SPEAKER_02]: stone friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Click the link, help us out on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also we're going to set Mike up a
Patreon campaign.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll get that going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully in the next episode,
we should probably just press pause and do
[SPEAKER_02]: it, but we'll keep moving right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll make it really easy for you to find.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll probably just search for white Mike
on Patreon is something like that will
[SPEAKER_02]: come up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get you going, Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to make you some, some Patreon
funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow from your heart podcast slash Mike,
maybe something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we'll get it going.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Mike wasn't confident in doing the
Patreon, but since I've said it on the
[SPEAKER_02]: show, now it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to all of our friends on
Patreon for keeping us accountable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to talk about cannabis on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also try to talk about events that are
current.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I saw something in the news and Mike
saw something in the news today and I
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't want to talk too much about it
because I avoid all this COVID stuff and I
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't sure how big of a deal it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It annoyed me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It frustrated me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike called me earlier and the first thing
he said was, you see these fucking idiots?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be a COVID protester.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are people in Denver surrounding the
Denver Capitol building protesting the
[SPEAKER_02]: stay at home orders for the COVID-19
protective orders, protective measures.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of silly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like my whole, my whole take is like,
what if you're wrong?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, like that's just been one of the,
like, if you're going to advocate for
[SPEAKER_01]: major shit like that, like, what if you're
wrong?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I get that it sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking hate it too, but what if you're
wrong?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What if you were fucking wrong and you're
out there getting everybody out there
[SPEAKER_02]: sick?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I know if like a lot of people that
have businesses want to get their shit
[SPEAKER_01]: open right away, but like, have you taken
a minute to imagine what that it would
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like to read the headline?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like my business in facts, 50 people kills
three people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like have you considered that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like protest that it sucks that your
business can't be open right now or that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't do your thing or can't go enjoy
whatever activity you're taking vacation
[SPEAKER_01]: or, but like just stay home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking let's get through that shit so we
can be done with this and be able to have
[SPEAKER_01]: it all be over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we don't stay home and stop volleying
the virus, the virus will keep bouncing
[SPEAKER_02]: and they will keep extending the stay at
home orders.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how real this is,
but my fear is that if we don't
[SPEAKER_02]: voluntarily just start staying at home,
they will eventually whoever they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I'm not like one of those Eddie
Bravo conspiracy theorists, but there will
[SPEAKER_02]: be some measures taken to force us to stay
at home and limit our movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now they are requesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we comply with requests,
that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we don't, I think they may up up
their game a little bit in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, but I'm, I'm way more worried about
the stupid people that I am about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the government trying to insist we
stay home.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they almost out there Darwinian
themselves?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they kind of Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's been really hard for me not to
be super mean on social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if we'll know for sure in two weeks,
but like if two weeks from April 19th,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause it was all this weekend,
if in about two weeks, the hospital
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers spike, this is why it's the
protests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, it's, it sucks,
but it's so easy to stay home right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it really sucks, but it's super easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Easy to stay home right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really boring, but I mean,
it's free.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could chill out at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything delivered.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get, I've had the weirdest shit
delivered the last month.
[SPEAKER_02]: Weirdest thing you've had delivered.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the weirdest thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Booze, ammo, hand cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we literally made our own hand
sanitizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had isopropyl alcohol delivered and
aloe vera delivered and my wife fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: magic that shit in the hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hand sanitizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like we made homemade hand
sanitizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had all this stuff for delivered fun
for the whole family.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had a fucking truckload of tootsie
pops delivered.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard your story about string cheese.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife's clicked the wrong size of string
cheese and we got like an encyclopedia
[SPEAKER_01]: Britannica set size thing of string
cheese.
[SPEAKER_01]: The kids are happy as shit with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there's a lifetime supply of string
cheese in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And less diapers to change.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet after all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, like you can watch anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got Disney plus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just watched all of rescue Rangers,
like three times through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Random.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the GI Joe episodes are up on
Hasbro's YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can watch all the old GI Joe.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working our way through the old
DuckTales now.
[SPEAKER_01]: DuckTales.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm loving it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like just enjoying little flashes from my
childhood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quarantine to be over.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can watch cartoons with you and your
kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're kind of living the dream over
there, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really kind of, it's really not that
bad once you get used to just being at
[SPEAKER_01]: home all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a grower and kind of, I like social.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get me wrong, but you know,
me, if you say stay home for seven days,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stoners and gamers are way more equipped
to handle these stay at home requests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I caught Bert Kreischer's new comedy
special.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was hot fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw Tom Segura's new comedy special,
hotter fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw Chris Delia's new special.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty good and fiery.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, there's new comedy specials out
to watch.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got fucking Netflix and Amazon prime
and Hulu and dude, so many people have
[SPEAKER_02]: been doing cool live feeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been doing more live feeds with my
friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam Ill is on live.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been catching a bunch of good lives
lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Granny kind of lives on live right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Live is just boom and live is the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram live.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, that's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's on Instagram live.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zoom, doing zoom shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done a couple.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a show with Scotty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did the cannabis 420 zoom.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've been trying to put out extra
content.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're talking about that stay at home
protest.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are people that we should give some
respect to.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were medical, what do you call them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, cause there weren't all nurses.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were medical professionals.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are medical professionals in their
scrubs with masks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were, so when, how are they doing it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Michael, I'll let you use, you were the
one that pointed it out to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The article I read in the first,
the first pictures I saw on social media
[SPEAKER_01]: was two of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just, when the red light hit,
they would just stand in the crosswalk.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was appropriate for people to be in
during that red light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when the crosswalk said,
stop, get out the way, they got out the
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they basically crossed the street back
and forth and that was their march back
[SPEAKER_02]: and forth the crosswalk.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just kind of, when it was instead of
crossing, they just stood there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when it said, all right,
stop crossing now, there's a little
[SPEAKER_01]: countdown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they got out the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think everybody knows how crosswalks
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were just telling everybody,
go home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause this is fucking silly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that people are really sick in my
hospital and I'm trying not to make you a
[SPEAKER_02]: patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, one of my favorite things,
they're extra insulted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they're not, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they're putting their safety at risk
to treat patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're putting their safety at risk to
treat patients.
They're putting their safety at risk to
treat patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're putting their safety at risk to
treat patients after patient, after
[SPEAKER_01]: patient, and dealing with all sorts of
fucked up ness on top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people dying alone and having to be
there with that and having to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: conduit of family on the phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like on a totally non COVID related
situation, I have a family member dying in
[SPEAKER_01]: the hospital right now and having people
visit and not visit and can visit and
[SPEAKER_01]: can't visit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fucking nightmare.
[SPEAKER_02]: My uncle passed by himself.
[SPEAKER_02]: My uncle had to pass by himself a few
weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got that going on, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their daughter can't leave the hospital
because she can't come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's the last visitor on the list.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she's literally stuck there until this
is over one way or the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't recall what I was doing the other
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was doing something that, I was doing
something I could have gotten hurt the
[SPEAKER_02]: other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, Nope, this isn't the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like even if I just cut my, I forgot what
I was like, I could, oops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, no, I don't even need
three stitches right now would be fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: way more traumatic than it needs to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I got to go to the hospital and
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, I've been doing a lot of stuff that
involves power tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a lot of like, let's take an
extra second for safety just because we
[SPEAKER_01]: really fucking don't want to go to the
hospital today.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything that happens right now,
if it's not 13 stitches, if it's 12
[SPEAKER_02]: stitches, it's happening at home.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got duct tape and crazy glue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, this has been a fun podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad we did this.
[SPEAKER_01]: No duct tape, no crazy glue.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Duct tape, crazy glue and Vaseline.
[SPEAKER_01]: The inaugural episode seems to be running
smoothly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see how the recording comes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've noticed a technical glitch,
but I can fix it and I know what I did
[SPEAKER_02]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as long as I learned what I did wrong,
I can definitely solve that problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not in my usual spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my microphone discipline is shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've noticed myself repeatedly leaning way
back in my chair.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the most part, I think we're picking
you up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sound seems good in my ear headphones
anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we got them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see how long we've been going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry guys, if you're listening to this,
we're just meandering today and kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: learning this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been going for 24 and a half
minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, less than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause there will be some editing at the
beginning there that we'll cut out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go for a little over 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got anything else on the cannabis hot
seat that you want to bring up today,
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or should I kind of work into another
topic for the show here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's jump to the next topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck those protesters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's just dumb.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is just ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Putting other people at risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys, we're going to stop talking
about the COVID madness pretty soon here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, you got to admit it is the hot
topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what's on all of our minds and it's
what's got Mike and I doing this today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I was listening to one of your
older shows and you did a piece on like
[SPEAKER_01]: content producers having kind of a
responsibility right now to help keep
[SPEAKER_01]: people entertained.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought that was a super legit thing
there to kind of realize and embrace.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also like it's important that we're
here and we should use our space here to
[SPEAKER_01]: encourage people to stay home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I know how much it sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm fucking miserable too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I fully fantasized about like
chucking one of my kids over the fence the
[SPEAKER_01]: other day, just cause.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not able to edit this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not getting edited.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's, it's really tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I a hundred percent get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just do your best to stay the fuck
home so we can get past this shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think about it, you can stay home
now, or you can stay in the hospital
[SPEAKER_02]: later.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of your options.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the thing that I'm so worried about
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there were a lot of people out,
not as many are there normally out
[SPEAKER_01]: celebrating around the Capitol this
weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there were a shitload of people out
and like carloads of people were packed in
[SPEAKER_01]: together for hours, driving in circles
around the Capitol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Packed like in heavy traffic with other
cars packed full of people, people walking
[SPEAKER_01]: around on the sidewalks, waving signs and
shit in the parks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I get how stir crazy everyone
is, but like if the smart people are
[SPEAKER_01]: right, a lot of people just got infected
and they all went home tonight and shared
[SPEAKER_01]: it with their family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and that sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the smart people are right on this,
it's gonna be ugly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: If those people have two people,
if half of the people got sick today,
[SPEAKER_02]: if a quarter of them got sick,
I'm not, I'm not an epidemiologist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to play that game.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have just described it and compared it
to the virus is almost, and this is just
[SPEAKER_02]: for my simple mind to grasp it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and for youngsters, I was talking to
somebody much younger.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a volleyball.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody threw a volleyball up in the air
and when it landed, somebody hit it and it
[SPEAKER_02]: broke into two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when that volleyball came back
down, somebody hit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those two and they turned in each one of
them turned into two more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time the volleyball gets volleyed,
it multiplies.
[SPEAKER_02]: It becomes two more volleyballs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're out there in society,
just volleying these volleyballs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's going like, it's like at a
fucking concert and the beach ball comes
[SPEAKER_02]: by.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone wants to hit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but beach ball, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you hit it up in the air and it goes
blind.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't think anything about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're infected.
[SPEAKER_02]: That ball's bouncing around, just
infecting everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we would quit bouncing the fucking
beach ball around, they would land on the
[SPEAKER_02]: ground and they would deflate and they
would fucking die.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we could go out there and not
have to worry about beach balls.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of the way I think of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's literally if everybody would just
stay the fuck home, like as much as they
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly could.
[SPEAKER_02]: And keep your balls to yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's just super quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey Mike, it's 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to take a dab, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just realized we've been talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 15 minutes into 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: 15 minutes into 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've got a dab loaded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's end the plea to stay home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, if you need better weed,
like... That's a good segue.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can help you stay home, people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, this is a good time to learn how to
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many people are buying seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see so many people on Facebook groups
and Instagram groups about how do I grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I do this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now is a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Delve into some books and podcasts and
YouTube channels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you're not getting into cannabis,
dude, get out and clean up your yard,
[SPEAKER_01]: clean up your house, clean up your shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I'm lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: We moved houses right before this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in the middle of February,
we moved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our move was kind of chaotic,
so it didn't really end until the first
[SPEAKER_01]: week of March.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they were like, all right,
everybody try to stay home.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, all right, finally a reason to
unpack boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: In peace.
[SPEAKER_01]: The downside of that is I've got a vehicle
that is like bursting with cardboard right
[SPEAKER_01]: now because I was getting ready to go take
it to the recycle place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the day I went to load it up and go,
I see a notice that says they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: taking shit right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because wherever they send it is closed
due to the virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so literally I finished loading up the
car and then I checked to make sure they
[SPEAKER_01]: were open that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, aw, fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got a bunch of cardboard now.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the fun things I've been
stockpiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody needs any boxes, fucking let me
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You trying to build a fort?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you got shit to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: These boxes were sent to me by fucking
Jeff Bezos.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a bunch of Bezos boxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: My fucking forerunner is full to burst.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm bursting with cardboard, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I catch myself ordering things,
online shopping.
[SPEAKER_02]: They come here and I'm like, oh cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You bought new shoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go put those in the fucking closet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you can't go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, oops, I had to stop myself
doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can play snare drums during the
quarantine though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've noticed that all of the drum
equipment I buy, you can play the shit out
[SPEAKER_02]: of that during quarantine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It works really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure the neighbors have learned a
lot of Led Zeppelin songs the past couple
[SPEAKER_02]: of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my neighbors, they're two,
they've got a couple of girls,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe two or three of them that are maybe
like six, eight, and 12-ish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every night at like seven 30,
I think it's right after they do dinner,
[SPEAKER_01]: they go out back and scream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I can't see them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just guessing from the sounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a local thing, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Howl for Pueblo every night at
eight o'clock.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they're not howling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's right after dinner.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not at eight o'clock.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just venting like the we've been
stuck inside all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: The shit sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they go out back and shout.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of cities are doing weird things to
show solidarity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some cities are howling and some cities
are screaming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people are shining flashlights into
the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me and the fam fully did the Pueblo Shines
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we had fun doing that every night.
[SPEAKER_01]: My kids really got into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see you loading up a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you got?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going with the grape cola and I'm
going to get myself in trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, that's a big dab for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of impressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a ginormous dab for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there may be a moment of this podcast
where there are just two guys coughing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, that's our spinoff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two guys coughing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone's going to fucking steal it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's ours.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're taking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trademark copyright.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two guys coughing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to heat up my dab nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, thanks for hanging out and
joining us for a Zoom video.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're not going to watch the
video.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to see the video.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agreed with Mike that we wouldn't do
video this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're breaking Mike in slowly,
but I want to thank you for joining us for
[SPEAKER_02]: this awkward episode of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: The main point of life is to have fun and
enjoy yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And spend time with your friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm fucking doing that right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just with Mike, but all my gang here
listening in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike's nodding his head as he's away from
his mic while he heats his nail,
[SPEAKER_02]: but he agrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for being the army, iry army gang
gang.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just getting this nail hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my setup is not heat the nail,
tuck on the microphone friendly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the inaugural episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working out some kinks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a skill to work the microphone and
the torch and the gear.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember an episode and Mike has spoken
of the time that he tried to hit the
[SPEAKER_02]: microphone.
[SPEAKER_02]: He put his mouth on the mic and then put
the dab on the dab nail and wondered why
[SPEAKER_02]: the smoke didn't flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, there's, there's some tricks to
this madness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I'm going to talk until my nail
is ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: This nail is not quite ready, but it's
getting there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I overheated mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just rambling, not paying attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I made mine into lava.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could reshape the glass if we needed
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am going to hit more of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send Mike a clean banger.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know where there's a place that could be
open for that banger.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we may have to send you there tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to hit the Malibu Pure Kush
because it's what I've got on the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cushy and it tastes delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's obviously working for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good podcast concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going with some grape cola batter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your batter looks really good,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a big fan of the batter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just went to the fridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just went to the fridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep my concentrates in the crisper
drawer and I reached in and grabbed a jar
[SPEAKER_02]: and what came out was Malibu Pure Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the dab for the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy 420 Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy 420 Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to hit a dab real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be a moment of silence, but you guys
smoke with us and it'll be just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just hear bubbler bubbles and
exhales.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good podcasting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheers everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're celebrating properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike just wrecked himself.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to let him cough for a couple
of minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll talk over here for a moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is taking me places and it was
delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're kind of different colors right now
in the video.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that how red I get when I dab like
this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you've seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you've seen the video.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's watching himself on the video guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: You ever watch one of your friends stare
at himself in a video and forget that he's
[SPEAKER_02]: on video.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Longtime listeners may remark that that
coughing fit was pretty shallow for my
[SPEAKER_01]: normals.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty good, especially for the
size dab you took.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could tell that the no smoking is
working for you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been able to hit all of my cannabis
products quite a bit harder lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you getting more stone from it?
[SPEAKER_01]: When I choose to hit them harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hurt myself with my dab and like the
second day or second, third day of
[SPEAKER_01]: quarantine, I was just puffing on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's kind of wanting the cigarette
and puffing on it too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got up and I went to get something
in the whole house kind of tilted like it
[SPEAKER_01]: was a boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got the wobbles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those pins can be dangerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just sipping on it and sipping on
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then suddenly you're like,
Oh, I have been sipping on it and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: gone and I'm wrecked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think your lungs kind of get used to
the pen you're hitting too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get used to the turf set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when I first started hitting it,
I could hit it kind of, but I'd cough a
[SPEAKER_01]: little if I hit it harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time I was ready to kill it,
I could sit there and rip on it till the
[SPEAKER_01]: light flashed at me and then tap the light
a couple of times or button a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: times and hit it harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get that second pool.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pins come in handy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not my favorite, but they do come
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really handy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grape cola was tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got me all chattery.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're almost sweaty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see you sweating from the dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw you pull off the hat.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got warmer in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've noticed that since my, and I don't
try to be that guy that's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've changed my diet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm amazingly healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys eat what you want fucking enjoy
life, but I have chosen to minimize my
[SPEAKER_02]: diet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a birthday recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a lot of things encourage me to
change my diet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm healthy and everything's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to be healthier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't had, I haven't, if you know me,
you know that I was a Dr. Pepper fanatic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't had a Dr. Pepper since
Valentine's day and it is now 4 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it was two days before
Valentine's day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was my last Dr. Pepper, but dude,
I get so lit sometimes now because I'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: doing the, I'm not doing the caffeine up
and dabs back down and caffeine up and
[SPEAKER_02]: dabs back down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's normal day, normal day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like, Whoa, thank you dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they really get me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've noticed, and since I've cut out
all the sugary stuff, I'm not eating
[SPEAKER_02]: cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no donuts and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Food tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Food tastes better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can taste my concentrates better
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm not, I'm not having syrup tongue
or whatever I was getting from the Dr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pepper and all the sugary crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to relearn food now that I don't
smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything fucking tastes weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't all taste like muted
cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do miss hanging out on the porch with
you when you would smoke a cigarette
[SPEAKER_02]: though.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of miss my outside time too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's no reason to just go out on
the porch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And be weird now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I stand out back with my bong every now
and again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not comfortable in my neighborhood
with my new neighbors and I'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: comfortable dabbing on the porch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll sit out there and smoke a joint,
but I'm not down with the dab rig and the
[SPEAKER_02]: torch on the porch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Torch on the porch is our other band name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two guys coughing and torch on a porch is
our first record.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not comfortable with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A friend of ours used to have a house like
it's going to sound like a weird way to
[SPEAKER_01]: say it, but it's like a major side street.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not meant to be a main artery through
our town, but it's the main way people get
[SPEAKER_01]: from one side of town to the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, steady traffic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only one lane each way, but if you
sat out there all day, you'd always have a
[SPEAKER_01]: car in front of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe get to two or three minute gap with
no traffic, but usually it's a steady
[SPEAKER_01]: stream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just out there fucking dabbing using a
propane torch to heat the fucking nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those propane torches make you look
different.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes you look different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So crackhead-y.
[SPEAKER_01]: So crackhead-y.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys go get a torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go get a vector torch or a special blue
double dragon torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get yourself a non crackhead torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got like a $35 torch from Bed Bath and
Beyond.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bitch works great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little Ken Brule torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: They last about a year and a half,
two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then all of a sudden it goes to shit on
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just go get another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: One day it just doesn't work anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or in the era of COVID, you order another
one from the internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good shout out to Amazon for keeping us
safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a time to be alive, homie.
[SPEAKER_02]: The perfect time, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost suspicious how perfectly
everything was set up for delivery and
[SPEAKER_02]: then we were all told to stay home,
but I am not going to be Eddie Bravo and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to go that route.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit like this happened before.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just society was substantially less
able to cope with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're so lucky right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you imagine trying to do this in the
nineties where there's, you can get food
[SPEAKER_01]: delivery, but it's pizza or Chinese.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the fuck it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or some summary sandwich kind of place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe if you're lucky, a place that does
like sandwiches or pastas would deliver,
[SPEAKER_01]: but only if you're lucky or live in a
major city.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was from, I'm from kind of right outside
of long beach in California so we could
[SPEAKER_02]: get some good shit delivered, but not
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And who knows what it would have been.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it could have been really
unsafe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go in there and touch all those videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got HBO, Showtime, Cinemax and other
basic cable channels.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're lucky enough to have cable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back then my TV never really left MTV at
Beavis and Butt-Head and fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: Headbangers Ball and everything you needed
was on MTV.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe late at night you put on USA Up all
night, but trying to catch Emanuel on
[SPEAKER_02]: Cinemax, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember watching the blurry channels?
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember trying to peek through the blurry
channel and catch a boob occasionally?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the blurry channels back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you go up past like 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mom had good cable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was funny cause the cartoon
channel was 50 and then the adult channels
[SPEAKER_02]: were 51 up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, well just go to cartoons
and then scroll up one and I can maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: catch a green boob on the side or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: People that are our age know what we're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to watch unscrambled porn or
scrambled porn.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Weird podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the weirdest, one of the weirdest
podcasts we'll ever do, I hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy 420 listeners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy 420 bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got lit off that dab feeling nice and
heavily medicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a good time to be alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you imagine doing this without dabs?
[SPEAKER_01]: You just black market herbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Picking seeds out of it and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're fucking setting up.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the day you used to have,
I would need so much equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would we say?
[SPEAKER_02]: 95.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would need a camera, probably the size,
at least the size of a shoe box to record
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I would need a server, probably the
size of another shoe box and then 72,000
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking cables to make those two things
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then listeners, if you want to laugh,
go look up a movie called pump up the
[SPEAKER_01]: volume.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that movie.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fucking seven minute stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: First podcast concept.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was just like baby podcasting,
pirate radio.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pirate radio, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should, I should go watch that again.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys watch that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great movie.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's yeah, it's a really good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may or may not be able to pull it up
for free on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a cool thing you can do if you
know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you type in Google docs slash pump up
the volume or Google doc slash movies,
[SPEAKER_02]: pump up the volume.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll find it in somebody's Google drive,
Google drives or Google docs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find, yeah, there's a way to,
I can't think of how to do it right now at
[SPEAKER_02]: the top of my head, but our listeners that
are texting like savvy are going to figure
[SPEAKER_02]: it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find other movies in people's
Google drives that are open and you can
[SPEAKER_02]: watch it from their drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the future is awesome.
Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I was going to say is now old man.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now all we need, I bought Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to say I bought Mike,
but we got Mike about about 130 bucks
[SPEAKER_02]: worth of equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got the focus, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was about a hundred bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Mike was like 40.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the laptop, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like less than 250 bucks worth of
gear.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got Mike going and he's on a video.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chat with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking at each other face to face
like real time.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no lag.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I expected a little bit of delay.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's zero lag happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes it super nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we're in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, we didn't get flying cars,
but we got the viruses from the movies and
[SPEAKER_02]: we got all the phone shit from the movies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did not get the flying cars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least we got podcasts and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I had a flying car, I'm afraid of
flying cars in our neighborhood,
[SPEAKER_02]: bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: People would be falling from the sky,
running out of gas on the way to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a lot of people down here can afford a
car that flies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'd just be the one dimensional
travel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then a few of us would just be just
zipping above looking like a asshole.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wouldn't be cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or would you probably be falling car?
[SPEAKER_01]: My backyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, we have been going for long enough
to where I think we should start wrapping
[SPEAKER_02]: this up because we're getting way off
topic, but it's been fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make sure that we've got a
successful show.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do like it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is going to be a bonus post 420
fucking episode.

[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for finding, making time to do a
fucking Zoom show with me.

little flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're doing it, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have to do some shit to my
background before we do video,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this is comfortable.

[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for being patient with me,
getting you taught.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to the family for giving me some
time to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not prepare a shout out for this
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, do you have anybody out there that
you would like to give a shout out to?
[SPEAKER_02]: You just looked at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's staying home.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the truth, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just do it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to all my friends staying
home and taking care of themselves and
[SPEAKER_02]: their families and each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, thank you again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody else out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Until next time, take a fat dab and give
your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see you in the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm feeling so very good about myself,
Babylon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm feeling good, damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke the marijuana and get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay among the weak kids and fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ain't got problem at home domestically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my girl, she does.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you call me, I smoke the marijuana
and get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay among the weak kids and fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love is the order of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You better find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put my problems behind me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke the marijuana and get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay among the weak kids and fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm so confident in myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing or no one that could get
to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those Babylonians mess with us today,
the music are playing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And smoke my problems away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couple of my friends were just chilling on
the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listening to the music from Jamaica to
Bahamas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we decided to go link the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if something for the brain,
it's the marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy as a lark when the good vibes stir
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the chanting starts, you get burning
fuel corrupt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoke all day and still we got the
earth to rub up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dirty Babylonian rap.
[SPEAKER_00]: We give thanks for the state we keep the
meditation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Music and more music will burn the pagans.
[SPEAKER_00]: No ifs, no buts, no argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana is my holy sacrament.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke the marijuana and get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay among the weak kids and fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke the marijuana and get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay among the weak kids and fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the things you need in life may
be difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all the time, it's gonna be easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we go smoke the marijuana and get
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay among the weak kids and fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm feeling so very good about myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pagans ain't feeling good well and that's
the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke the marijuana and get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay among the weak kids and fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I got problem at home
domestically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my lady just wanna quarrel with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke the marijuana and get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay among the weak kids and fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love is higher and the day you gotta find
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big man and I put my problem behind
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke the marijuana and get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, woo.
Woo.
Woo.
Woo.
Woo.
Woo.
Woo.
Woo.
Woo.
Woo.
