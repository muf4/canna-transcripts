[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I said I was going to answer a
few listener emails on this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not waste a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This first message came from our friend on
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my buddy Kip.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says yo rasta Jeff, I hope you're
having a great Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is super hot, but I'm adjusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize if you do hear the air
conditioner in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not turning it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna keep that thing flowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, it says I just received my irie
direct order and I noticed an extra 10
[SPEAKER_00]: pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friend has discovered the irie
direct page.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to irie genetics.com,
you will see the tab that says irie
[SPEAKER_00]: direct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend has seen that link.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says I received my order and
received an extra 10 pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you said on a recent podcast that
you do occasionally send out testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just wanted to make sure I didn't
get a whole extra pack by mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do send out testers, but I make sure
that people know they are getting testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make sure they can run them right away,
that they are prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you got, my friend, was a gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that people work hard for their
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that money is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way to get money is by putting in
your time, your effort and your energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're bombarded by life as humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understand that you work really hard
for your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you buy seeds from me,
I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: To show everybody their thank you and
their appreciation for buying seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: I make sure to include some freebies with
every single order.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those were a gift to you from me to
say, hey, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't have to buy seeds from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have bought from hundreds of
other seed makers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there are thousands of seed
makers out there that you could have
[SPEAKER_00]: chosen to give your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate that you chose to send
your money my direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to say thank you, my friend,
you got 10 extra seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate you noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have room to grow them now,
send them to a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow them next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're extras.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody else out there, if you do get
extra beans in your order, have no fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can share them with a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, if you don't have space or
time to grow them right now, share them
[SPEAKER_00]: with the grower in need.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know somebody that needs some
beans, pass them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spread the love.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next time you order seeds from me,
the caramel will probably double up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will work out in your favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next question does come from the
YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a comment left on a video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't usually take questions from the
YouTube but this one looks like a good
[SPEAKER_00]: thing I should mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could ramble about for a couple of
seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes from our buddy, Local Grow Guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Local Grow Guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you see this episode of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, great show, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to do a live Q&A show.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube followers would love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love and stay safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really good message.
[SPEAKER_00]: My answer is I do a live show every Monday
on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every Monday around 7, 10 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain Time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go live Mountain Time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what time zone you are in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in Mountain Time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every Monday, approximately 7,
10.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be 7, 05.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be 7, 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the internet gives me some
trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually get there as quickly as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 7, 10-ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I answer questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody in the Instagram is able to
type in and ask me questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do my best to answer every single
question that comes in through the
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram live.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, so much love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my favorite questions get written
down and recycled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do make a full podcast out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't feel, I'm not prepared on
the live show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like Stump the Grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can ask me whatever they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people ask a lot of random,
crazy questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask grow question, music questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Questions about random shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Questions about sneakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a sneaker head if you're not aware of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So join us Monday on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Instagram is Irie underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I-R-I-E underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for the notification on Monday around
7, 10 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will go live.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to type in all of your grow
questions, your random questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will do my best to answer all of
them on the fly live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe in the future I do need to learn how
to do a live Q&A on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, we're sticking with the
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do it every Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing it for several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has become kind of a tradition.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people jump in and check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So join us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, Irie underscore genetics on
Instagram every Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: 7, 10 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as well produced as this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I edit this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I write notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a plan for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Monday, I bring the dab rig and a bunch
of good dabs and a couple of cold
[SPEAKER_00]: beverages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just hang out and get lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to answer the questions as
quickly as possible, as accurately and
[SPEAKER_00]: thoroughly as possible, without any
preparation, any study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that keeps it fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: That keeps me on my toes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeps my brain active.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a good time to just kind of hang out
with the crew and take some dabs and talk
[SPEAKER_00]: some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another question right here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This comes from our buddy who calls
himself FAPlantCount, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: F your plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me do what I need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I do have to follow the rules
because everybody knows who I am by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, this message came from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the Patreon crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, my brother?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everything is Irie, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hundred and something degrees
outside and it is nice and cool in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a frosty cold beverage in front of
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a few fat dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friend who teleported me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Manifested somehow the lemon Jeffrey dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who you are, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't want to, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, we're alive here on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, thank you for answering my last
question about reversing a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown a few dozen strains,
but I'm coming across an anomaly which
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love anomalies.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I am growing end game RBX
punchline by Ethos.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very creative, long name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I've come across a phenotype that
virtually does not pistol out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not making any of the things that
you guys call hairs, which are the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding parts of the female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not making any of those,
which is kind of rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, both phenos I have through very
little pistols in the stretch phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now at day 50, one house beautiful dense
hairless nugs top to bottom and stinks
[SPEAKER_00]: like Swedish fish and hubba bubble,
hubba bubba gum had an orgies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we took some Swedish fish,
hubba bubba gum, and we had an orgy with
[SPEAKER_00]: them, that's what this plant would smell
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't sound too bad in my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells kind of sweet and juicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy that smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, the other plant has hairless main
colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the lower golf balls got pistols,
late and flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spoke with other people growing this and
it seems to be common.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember you mentioning some wonky
things happen after a few reversals down
[SPEAKER_00]: the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can count at least three or four
that went into these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a mutation that comes from
reversals?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that it's a mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could just be a trait maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know necessarily it's a mutation
because I don't have the qualification to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify that that is a definition of a
mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is definitely a trait that we're
noticing and it's a commonality if a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people are getting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, do you think these plants would
be sterile?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would assume so, but I have no way of
being certain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I took three clones of the
hairless girl and put them outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already assumed putting them outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: May give them a different phenotypical
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see a lot different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, but I figured no pistols,
no pollination and I would have to worry
[SPEAKER_00]: less about my outdoor crop being
pollinated by a careless neighbor or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really great idea, a really
great assumption, a really great hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would take one of those plants and
put it indoors and attempt to pollinate it
[SPEAKER_00]: just once just to see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being the highly inquisitive, curious
person that wants to know, I just want to
[SPEAKER_00]: know what if.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would take that pistolless plant and I
would put it in a room with a male plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and I would just put some pollen on it or
I've always got some pollen in a fridge or
[SPEAKER_00]: in a freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd grab some of that pollen and just dust
a couple of plants with that or a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of clones of this plant with that and see
what happened and see if you can make any
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you would know that those are sterile
or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But your assumption is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant will probably not take pollen
as well, probably make fewer seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be a really good plant for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is how do you get more seeds
of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to keep cloning it or make a
bunch of clones is the only way that one
[SPEAKER_00]: carries.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the end game.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something that we used to hear
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, this is old cannabis, Laura.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't mean to talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long have I been going?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're going to get off on a
side right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a thing that they talk about back
in the day that is known as the terminator
[SPEAKER_00]: gene, which was bred into plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, if I read up on it, I could
figure out it's not something I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some breeders, a breeder, somewhere along
the line discovered how to breed plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and breed what is called the terminator
gene into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you breed certain filial generations
into each other, you can create sterile
[SPEAKER_00]: plants basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know exactly how to do it,
but I think it's an octoploid or from what
[SPEAKER_00]: I've spent so long since I read it,
I'm not going to ramble and get it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is the terminator gene where you
can breed it to where the plants actually
[SPEAKER_00]: do not make any more seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not fertile plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get males that'll kick out pollen,
but the females do not take any pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't make pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cannot get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're non-fertil is the word my brain is
searching for as I ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is possible I'm not making any
assumptions or accusations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am saying it as an option that maybe our
friend has bred in the terminator gene by
[SPEAKER_00]: accident here, or it just popped up,
or maybe these plants will breed
[SPEAKER_00]: completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no evidence of either direction,
but these are all possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me make sure I got to the bottom of
this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I can't wait to pop your wombat
fems in a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love from our friend who calls
themselves Joe Jizz.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing so great till that part,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the creative name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you do have the great assumption
that since these plants have fewer pistols
[SPEAKER_00]: than most plants, that they won't receive
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would hate to find out the wrong
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would definitely be the way to make
an ass of you and me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe put it indoors, hit it with some
pollen, see what it does, then put it
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like you've already done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to put it to the true test.
[SPEAKER_00]: If any of your neighbors are out there
with some stray pollen, that plant will
[SPEAKER_00]: get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it makes seeds, then it makes seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only way to find out,
though, is to pollinate that bitch and to
[SPEAKER_00]: find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for letting me talk about the
Terminator gene on accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had forgotten all about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do more research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you guys remind me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to do a show that involves more
of the Terminator gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next message does come from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the Patreon crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, patreon.com forward slash grow
from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend Aron and it
goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, how about an in-depth
conversation?
[SPEAKER_00]: About getting into the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good topic that we can talk
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm going to cover is what I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how to get into the basically the
legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm going to cover today is getting
into the legal Colorado cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: the marijuana enforcement division,
regulated legal cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: the big grows that produce legal cannabis
for the legal dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm going to focus on today
because any other cannabis business or
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into the industry, you have to
kind of find your niche.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't mean to even do this when I
started this brand, this seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I invented this on my own on
accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: People wanted them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sold some of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: People wanted more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just kind of snowballed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually I had a seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was breeding out of passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're doing something you're
passionate about that you can turn into a
[SPEAKER_00]: business, do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing something that is
ancillary of cannabis that you can cater
[SPEAKER_00]: to this industry, do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing I'm going to say before I
jump into talking about creating your own
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis or what I'm going to focus on
here is the legal side of the industry is
[SPEAKER_00]: don't turn your passion, your favorite
thing into a career that could possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: burn out your passion for whatever that
subject is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to be in the music industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not hyping it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not bragging.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a story here for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to play music professionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been around the country playing the
drums with several bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been on a lot of big stages,
been on even more small stages,
[SPEAKER_00]: been in a lot of tiny shit clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Playing little tiny shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been all over the place playing
music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been all over making money.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my career.
[SPEAKER_00]: Playing drums was my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I did five nights a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I paid the bills, how I paid
the rent, how things worked out for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also worked at guitar center for a
little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a department manager, obviously a
drum department manager at guitar center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two things combined kind of burnt me
out on the desire to be around and
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in music.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a time when I would leave my job
at guitar center and most people,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you get out of work, you probably
walk out to the car, you get to the car,
[SPEAKER_00]: you sit down and do that, oh, I'm fucking
off work thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You check your phone and you crank up some
music and get on the road, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get in the car and hit the pipe as
hard as I fucking could because I wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to get super stoned and get all the
terrible guitar sounds out of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to hear the intro to Enter
Sandman.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to hear fucking Back in Black
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to hear Stairway to Heaven.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been hearing it all day long and it
was just driving me crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd get in the car and turn the music
off and try to get as stoned as I could
[SPEAKER_00]: where I didn't hear music anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then going on tour, it wasn't fun to
be like, well, we've got to play this gig,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then we can't have any fun because as
soon as we're done, we've got to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: gear off the stage and get in the van and
get to the next city because we've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: play in 12 hours in another city and we
don't even have that much time to drive
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would just get hectic, maybe not 12
hours, but you see what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: It would burn you out to where playing the
drums was more, it became work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I don't have to show up for a gig
and play at a certain time when I do get
[SPEAKER_00]: to beat on the drums, it is so joyous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is so much fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: My point here, what I'm rambling forever
about is don't turn your cannabis career
[SPEAKER_00]: into what I did with music.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a while when I didn't want to go
to a concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to go see live music because
it just felt like work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I'd rather just miss this show
and let myself start to miss music again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm passionate about music again,
but don't let this happen to you with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't uproot your whole life to move to
another state to get a job as a trimmer
[SPEAKER_00]: because you think it's going to change
your whole life being a trimmer or being a
[SPEAKER_00]: grotech or being a dispensary budtender.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could ruin your passion for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have bosses around
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to associate one of your
favorite things with work, with stress,
[SPEAKER_00]: with a paycheck, with a headache,
with bad customers, with a terrible boss,
[SPEAKER_00]: with deadlines, expectations?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to put that on your favorite
thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my advice to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, fortunately, beautifully,
I've established a beautiful career,
[SPEAKER_00]: a place in this industry to where I love
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot get burnt out on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am passionate about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wake up thinking about growing and
smoking and consuming cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: teaching you guys how to grow better herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure that you don't put yourself
in a position where you're going to hate
[SPEAKER_00]: your life, your career, your location,
and the plant because you wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: combine all of those things into one
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep some space, separation of plant and
state, I guess, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now let's talk more about the
email, the shit that I did write down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to get into the legal
marijuana enforcement division,
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated legal cannabis industry here in
Colorado, the first thing you have to do
[SPEAKER_00]: is do you qualify?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a checklist of things on the
marijuana enforcement division.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I get my badge checklist?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a website you will go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have written that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to do some of the
work on your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a website, marijuana enforcement
division.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see if you qualify to even get a
marijuana enforcement division worker's
[SPEAKER_00]: badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be a few questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you had any felonies within the past
few years?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember the exact questions and
I'm not going to ask all of them right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a questionnaire.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to find out if you qualify.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've done some things that they find
unacceptable or that you may need to
[SPEAKER_00]: correct, you do not qualify for the badge
at this time, which means you shouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: pack up and move to Colorado and try to
get a weed industry job because you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: even get the badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you even think about coming here,
before you think about applying for a job,
[SPEAKER_00]: see if you qualify for that badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't come here, check other
states.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many other states developing
cannabis industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't the only place to go,
but this is where I know the rules,
[SPEAKER_00]: the process, and the steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what I can talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you qualify for the badge?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do, get all the required paperwork,
the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It costs money to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the money together, then apply for the
badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to come all the way to
Colorado just to apply for the badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you come here to apply for that
badge, I recommend you visit where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a friend who is on our Patreon
who listens to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That person decided that after listening
to the show and hearing about the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, they were going to pack up their
life and move to the east side of Pueblo,
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado, and get a job in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That only took them about four days to
realize they do not want to be on the east
[SPEAKER_00]: side of Pueblo, and they got out of there
as quickly as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been complaining to me in a
friendly way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been venting about how not so
great their new location is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they would have visited here for just a
couple of days before they moved here and
[SPEAKER_00]: set up shop, they probably would have
realized they did not want to move to
[SPEAKER_00]: where they were moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: My advice to you is come visit or go visit
wherever you think you're going to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's Broomfield, Pueblo, Denver,
Longmont, what's down south, Trinidad,
[SPEAKER_00]: any of those places, they all have good
and bad things about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go see if it's for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some places are for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some places are simply not for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go see before you leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, do you qualify?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you even get the badge, the
requirements to work in the industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then go see the place you're thinking
about going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody tells big tales and fantasies
about what they do for work when they grow
[SPEAKER_00]: places.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want you to think they're living the
dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to tell you that it
fucking snows for four months out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: year and it's terribly fucking cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to tell you about that
crazy shit, but come visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get back on my list here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you qualify?
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about visiting when you get your
badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the places you think you're going
to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit's expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a heads up before you move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then search for jobs before you move.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you come out here to visit,
look at the dispensaries around you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the grows around you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to be a grower, when you go to
the dispensary ask, is there a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: attached to this facility and are they
hiring?
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll probably have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll tell you how to apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may give you an application.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be able to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to work in the dispensary,
just ask, can I work here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend shopping in the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the same trip as you get your
application and or drop off your
[SPEAKER_00]: application.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want a customer employee
interaction at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks to me as a hiring manager,
it looks like you just happen to be here
[SPEAKER_00]: buying weed and thought maybe I'll apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do them in two separate transactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for professionalism, that is my
advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do go to the interview,
don't show up in your torn Led Zeppelin
[SPEAKER_00]: t-shirt and your sweatpants and your dirty
shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show up looking like you want a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat this just like any other job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show up for the job you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you show up looking like you don't
really work hard, we're gonna think that
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't really work hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have dreadlocks, but I tie them up
and make them presentable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shave a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a good beard, trim it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Manicure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have a beard and look good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got dreadlocks and I take care of
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be presentable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't show up looking lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't show up late.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't show up high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, show up high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I show up to everything high, but don't
show up noticeably high.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they can tell you're high, you're not
gonna get the job, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sharp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be present.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Took my brain a minute to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're learning life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be present at the job interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could be lit and be present,
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're too stoned to be fucking
functional at the interview, don't do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look for jobs before you get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then take the interview very, very
seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then something you're gonna have to accept
here is that in Colorado, most of the jobs
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to start you off as either like
a trimmer or a budtender.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am usually, so I used to be a consultant
and a hiring manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to do a lot of things in the
commercial industry and the commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since COVID, it got kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've taken a step back from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made sort of a career change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, it was really stressful running
commercial grows, but one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibilities in those commercial grows
was to hire the crew, hire the staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the hiring manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my jobs was to make sure that
everybody was gonna work well together,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that everybody was going to be
able to do their job, make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody understood their job.
[SPEAKER_00]: One way that I did that was that everybody
that started that grow, if I was hiring
[SPEAKER_00]: you to be the lead grower or the next
consultant, my starting position was that
[SPEAKER_00]: you were going to be the trimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody starts off as a trimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to show me that you can show up
on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can follow instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You come back from lunch on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do your job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can work with the group.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can participate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just basic shit that I need employees to
do before I give them too much access to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a trimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make them trimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We trim a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we find out who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we see that you can work,
after a week or two, I'll take you back to
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow and introduce you to small grow
tasks.
[SPEAKER_00]: My point is be prepared to start at the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be, and I'm sorry if the trimmers
are offended that I say you're starting at
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the entry level into the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying you're the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me give the trimmers some love because
I feel bad that I said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trimmers, I fucking love you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without the trim crew, there would be no
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the shit that we grow would sit in a
room and get moldy and funky if the trim
[SPEAKER_00]: crew didn't trim it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the go-between between the grow
and the store as the trim crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are your quality assurance team.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're learning quality control.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're learning how to trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're learning what to expect,
what goes to the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trim crew is a very important aspect
of the operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel bad that I kind of made it feel
like you were not as important as you are
[SPEAKER_00]: because you are very important,
but you are the entry area for my
[SPEAKER_00]: training.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to the trim crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kissing your ass now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel bad the way I said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trim crew, you gotta start on the trim
crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know you show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we know you're gonna show up,
then we'll move you around the grow to the
[SPEAKER_00]: place that you wanted to be, but you're
gonna have to move up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna let you show up in water
plants on the first day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you can follow
instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're on drugs,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We gotta learn you and figure you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be prepared to start at the bottom and
work your way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your performance will tell me how far and
where you go in my facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want everybody to be lead growers
because one day, and it does happen,
[SPEAKER_00]: I might get sick or who knows what could
happen to me, and I want there to be
[SPEAKER_00]: people in line to take over my position.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want everybody to be a grow tech
forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want everybody to be the lead grower,
the consultant, the head grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: the head motherfucker in charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the goal so that everybody just
keeps to get moving up.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I leave a facility, that lead grower
should become the new, whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: director of cultivation, and then
everybody should just take steps up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we should all be passing down that
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be afraid to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start at an entry-level position as a
trimmer, as a training budtender,
[SPEAKER_00]: as just somebody in the back packaging
shit up all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to find out, basically,
we're testing you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you show up five days in a row on
time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you come back from lunch five days in
a row on time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you work with the group?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you follow instructions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you steal anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Basic shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be ready to start at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, expect shit pay, shit treatment,
shit work, and shit hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new people always get the shit,
but that's how it is in almost any
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We exaggerate that in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do get hired in the commercial
facility, it will not be glamorous work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get nutrients on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get muddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to do some outside work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to take out the
trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also may have to clean the bathrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'm going to make a note.
[SPEAKER_00]: I clean the bathrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there's just a chart on the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every employee gets a list, and then we
just go down the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I clean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomorrow, you clean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next day, that guy cleans it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just go down the fucking rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, there's enough people on the
list.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to do it very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just clean in the bathroom once every
couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys clean the shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You took a shit in there, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we all have to clean the bathrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to do all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're going to start off at kind of
low pay, because unless you get a job like
[SPEAKER_00]: a lead grower or a consultant or a lead
budtender or a manager or something higher
[SPEAKER_00]: up, it is going to be low pay and crappy
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the terrible part about it is a lot of
the employers don't have to pay higher,
[SPEAKER_00]: because there are plenty of people that
keep coming from other states to work here
[SPEAKER_00]: to do the jobs, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not going to raise the wages.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not enough profit to raise the
wages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, that's just how it is in
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I noticed that
camera doing something weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to wrap up this show before I lose
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure we get all of this
recording saved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do hope I answered this question
thoroughly, because I just bailed,
[SPEAKER_00]: pulled the ripcord, and panic mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and foes, smokers, growers,
clone cutters, Paul and Chuckers,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts
out there, I do want to thank you once
[SPEAKER_00]: again for listening to this episode that I
do hope makes it to the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions, corrections,
comments, or concerns, please do send them
[SPEAKER_00]: to me at growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to hearing from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the Patreon at patreon.com
forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else is on the website at
iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for wrapping it up so
abruptly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't want to lose anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back in a couple of days with
fresh new content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll fix the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give a big shout out to my buddy
Stone or Dave.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mom a hug for me.
