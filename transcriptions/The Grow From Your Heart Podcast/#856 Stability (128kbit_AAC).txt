[SPEAKER_01]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the podcast, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode 856 of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've got another great episode
lined up for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: In today's show, I'm going to give away
free seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang on, we'll talk more about those free
seeds later on in today's episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get too far, I do want to send a
few shout outs to a few of the great folks
[SPEAKER_01]: who support the show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's send a big thank you shout out to my
buddy Ames High.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's send a fist bump and a thank you
shout out to Johnny Possum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to send a big thank you shout
out to one of my favorite photographers,
[SPEAKER_01]: ADHDgrower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks and big shout out for all of
the continued Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to support the show on
Patreon, make sure you check patreon.com
[SPEAKER_01]: forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, now let's move into the pet
peeve portion of today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of you may know what a pet peeve is.
[SPEAKER_01]: A pet peeve is something that just drives
you crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe when you walk into a grow space or
maybe when you look at a friend's grow
[SPEAKER_01]: space on pictures, maybe you see something
that just drives you crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to give you folks the opportunity
to send me your grow room pet peeves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, if I read your pet peeve
here on the podcast, I will send you a
[SPEAKER_01]: coupon code for a free pack of seeds at
iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's pet peeve goes a little bit like
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, yo Rasta Jeff, what's up,
brother?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the other great message and
make sure you check your inbox because
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got a coupon code for a free pack
of seeds from iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pet peeve says, I hope all is well
with you and yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a massive pet peeve that I think a
serious growers know all too well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I've pre-screened this pet peeve and
I completely agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pet peeve says, one of my biggest pet
peeves is growers who cannot keep track of
[SPEAKER_01]: their clones and they mislabel their
clones with the wrong name or they just
[SPEAKER_01]: make up new names because they can't
remember their plants lineage at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man, that is aggravating.
[SPEAKER_01]: This person says, it drives me nuts and
absolutely mad when something is supposed
[SPEAKER_01]: to be sherbert or cake and it smells like
burnt rubber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, hope all is well in your world and
one love from your friend Chooch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chooch, my dude, thank you for the great
pet peeve.
[SPEAKER_01]: I completely agree with you, my dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't keep yourself organized,
I don't want to even get a clone from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please label all of the plants in your
garden very carefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one very important step.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you do give me a clone,
please make sure that that clone is what
it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with this person.
[SPEAKER_01]: It drives me nuts when they're like,
I think this one is this, I think this one
[SPEAKER_01]: is this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro, just grow it, smoke it, get rid of
it, try again later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Properly label those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next time, please label your shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're going to give me or another
person a clone, please make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: clone is what it's supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are selling clones right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've talked about before,
I sell clones on Hi-Reed Direct when they
[SPEAKER_01]: are available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Join the newsletter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get updates.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, the Lemon Jeffrey will be
available soon in clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: When people get that, they're going to
expect a lemony, citrusy, tall growing
[SPEAKER_01]: Lemon Jeffrey plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I send them a stretchy, skinny OG Kush
plant, they're all going to be pissed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you do give somebody, sell somebody
a clone, please make sure that that thing
[SPEAKER_01]: is what it is labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because people get very excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: We grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We spend a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then 15 weeks later, we find out that
you lied to us and gave us something and
[SPEAKER_01]: took money for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we feel slighted.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't like you anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think you're a dick.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20-something years ago, somebody sold me a
clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I paid a lot of money for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was not what it was supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to this day, I don't fuck with that
guy because he took a lot of money from
[SPEAKER_01]: me, blatantly lied to me, saw how excited
I was, offered me more cuts of the same
[SPEAKER_01]: thing for more money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And none of those cuts were what they were
supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not going to say his name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to say who he is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't fuck with that guy anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: From a small clone transaction 20 years
ago, that's how important it was to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a great pet peeve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Label your shit, especially if you're
going to give it out, share it,
[SPEAKER_01]: distribute it in any way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that shit is properly labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people like it shouldn't matter
that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like if you went to a restaurant and
you were vegan and you ordered a vegan
[SPEAKER_01]: meal and they brought you a steak,
you'd be pissed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like if you paid money for a clone
that was labeled diesel, they brought you
[SPEAKER_01]: strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would be pissed just like you should
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to consider myself sort of a
cannabis historian.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been around a long time in this
industry, in this business, in this
[SPEAKER_01]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched it go from the black market or
the free market, whatever you want to call
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It evolved into the medical marijuana
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we've got the full recreational market
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw a lot of brands develop here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw a lot of brands come and go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw a lot of breeders come and go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw a lot of products happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since I was there in that whole thing,
as it was happening, I kind of took it as
[SPEAKER_01]: part of my responsibility to become the
historian and make sure that all of that
[SPEAKER_01]: shit is proper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I want the stories and the history
to be proper, I need the genetics and the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants to be proper as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a breeder as well, the cannabis
historian in me, the breeder, the person
[SPEAKER_01]: that's been here for a while, I want all
these stories and things to line up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of bullshit out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of my responsibilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm taking the responsibility to make sure
that all of the cannabis lore is spread
[SPEAKER_01]: properly, spread truthfully, and I want
the genetics to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please help me preserve the story,
the history, the legend, the lore,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the reality and the truth of cannabis
so that we can keep all this lore,
[SPEAKER_01]: keep it true, keep it positive,
is what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am rambling.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the pet peeve portion of today's
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you once again to my dude Chooch for
the great pet peeve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, I've got your email address
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check your inbox for that free pack of
seeds from ireadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the portion of the show where I do
ask you to click like and subscribe.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you enjoy my cannabis ramblings,
please click like, make sure you click
[SPEAKER_01]: subscribe.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way, every time I put out a new
episode, you will get a notification.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never miss any of my amazing cannabis
content.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move into the email, the question
and answer portion of today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I have a website.
[SPEAKER_01]: That website is ireadgenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to that website on the top,
there is a row of tabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those tabs does say grow help.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you click on that grow help tab,
you are given the opportunity to send me a
[SPEAKER_01]: grow question.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you send me a grow question and I read
that question here on the podcast,
[SPEAKER_01]: I will send you a coupon code for a free
pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: At ireadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's first question came from somebody
who's going to be called CoolJMans.
[SPEAKER_01]: What up CoolJMans?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to meet you, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, I love the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put out a bunch of useful knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you find it useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to know that I'm helping
somebody out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, anyway, I recently came into
contact with my parents old seed stash.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a gift you just found my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, So these are seeds from the
eighties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any chance these seeds are viable
or are they way too old?
[SPEAKER_01]: My dude CoolJMans, you have found a great
stash there, a great mother load there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only one good way to find out if
those seeds are still any good and that is
[SPEAKER_01]: to germinate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before you germinate them,
have a grow space ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've already got a grow
environment, a grow room built in your
[SPEAKER_01]: house, a grow tent somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before you germinate these seeds,
have a grow room set up just in case they
[SPEAKER_01]: do work.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if you germinate them and they sprout
and they look super healthy?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to want to get them into some
dirt, into some pots, under some lights,
[SPEAKER_01]: get them growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my advice, my first advice is don't
even fuck with them until you've got a
[SPEAKER_01]: grow environment, a grow room,
a grow space ready to dedicate to some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have to be a lot of room,
but if you're going to sprout them,
[SPEAKER_01]: grow them, make sure it's worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the other piece of advice I've got is
germinate a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they germinate, like I said,
get them going, get them growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: treat them just like any other plant that
you found, take clones, keep mother
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, do whatever you can do to preserve
it just in case you find a winner,
[SPEAKER_01]: grow that shit out, sample it,
smoke it, choose the best one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have something fucking amazing in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also may have a bunch of dud seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you may have some real gold in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my first step, set up a grow space,
have a grow room ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Step number two, attempt to germinate some
of these seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing I can recommend to really
help you out is if they're real thick
[SPEAKER_01]: shelled seeds, maybe take some light
sandpaper and kind of rough up those
[SPEAKER_01]: shells just a little bit to make the water
easier to penetrate that shell,
[SPEAKER_01]: make it easier to get that shell open for
when the water hits it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can open and grow a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the other thing I would recommend,
there is a product called URB.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is spelled U-R-B, URB.
[SPEAKER_01]: That product will be very beneficial in
helping you germinate those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be forewarned, it is not cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a costly product and I say follow
the instructions on the bottle and use
[SPEAKER_01]: that to help assist in the germination of
your seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you've got a bunch of them,
if you've got like you've got,
[SPEAKER_01]: did you say what you found them in?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, your parent's old seed stash.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're probably in one of those little
black film canisters.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm assuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what all parents from the 80s and
90s had their seeds in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But pour a few out, pour out 10,
20%, germinate them, see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they don't germinate naturally the way
you do it, then get some of the URB
[SPEAKER_01]: product and try that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they don't germinate that way,
they're probably not going to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really have a room set up,
have a place for them to go before you
[SPEAKER_01]: even germinate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what if they they pop?
[SPEAKER_01]: What if they sprout?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to want to grow them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't have space, that's kind
of you just wasted a bunch of seeds that I
[SPEAKER_01]: could have ran that could have been hot
fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could have found the next chem dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could have been slinging packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, excuse me for the throat clearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even going to edit that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that time of year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's starting to get cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the beanie on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the first night it's been cold in the
grow area.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the recording area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting to get the winter shift.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get the stuff in your throat and the
stuff in your nose and the winter shift
[SPEAKER_01]: that's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to hear a couple throat
clearings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I shouldn't even talk about it that long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me is what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get back on track here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jay man's my dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I helped you out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I encouraged you to get in there
and grow some of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you do this, when you try this,
let me know the progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me some pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know how it went for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, maybe wait a little bit because
you've got some free seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you've got to do is visit I read
direct dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use that coupon code.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get yourself a free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way, if these old seeds don't work,
you got a backup plan for that grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told you to get ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jay man's let's keep this momentum going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a good vibe flow in today.
[SPEAKER_01]: This next question came from our friend
Megatron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Megatron Megatron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check your inbox because
you've got a coupon code for that free
[SPEAKER_01]: pack of seeds at I read direct dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: This question did come from the grow help
tab on I read genetics dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I say the website so many times
trying to get it programmed in your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it programmed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you programmed yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you assimilated?
[SPEAKER_01]: What did I smoke?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucking working.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_01]: This question came from Megatron Megatron
had a real quick, real short question.
[SPEAKER_01]: This short one, two, three, four,
five, six word question could be a
[SPEAKER_01]: complete podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can answer this with a complete podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try to keep this short and sweet so
that you understand what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Megatron had a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, how do you find stable genetics?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the first thing we should focus on
is the word stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you mean by stable in the cannabis
realm?
[SPEAKER_01]: The word stable is kind of thrown around
and misused.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people think that stability has
something to you to do with the with the
[SPEAKER_01]: intersex trade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, maybe those plants aren't sexually
stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of the time when we talk about
stability and agriculture, we are mostly
[SPEAKER_01]: referring to uniformity amongst progeny
amongst phenotypes and a population.
[SPEAKER_01]: What that means in layman's terms is if I
grow 100 plants, I want to see one
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotype amongst those 100 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is stability.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I grow out 100 seeds, all 100 should
look just like each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that that line is stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we talk about in horticulture
and agriculture when we mean stability is
[SPEAKER_01]: if we run a population of seeds,
how many phenotypes are you going to get?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to get four, six,
12 different phenotypes, that is not
[SPEAKER_01]: considered stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be sexually stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may not be intersex.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of stability and the
horticultural realm, that is not what we
[SPEAKER_01]: refer to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this case, I'm going to focus on the
phenotypical stability of a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk briefly about sexual stability
because I'm sure that that's what a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people are thinking of when the word
stable comes up in cultivation and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sexual stability.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we get to that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Buy seeds from a reputable breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of those seeds should not be
intersex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Intersex should not be sexually
challenged.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of those should be sexually stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to do it yourself,
breed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find a male and a female plant that are
both sexually stable on their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you find any intersex lines or any
intersex plants in that line, don't breed
[SPEAKER_01]: with those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find more plants that don't express
intersex traits and breed more and keep
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go forward in filial generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go back crosses, but breed with
plants that don't express intersex traits
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can breed the intersex out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can create sexually stable plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my brief sexual stability talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to focus on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about main uniformity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is mainly what I think this question
should be about if we're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: stability in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we find stable genetics?
[SPEAKER_01]: First, we're going to define stability.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, I'm going to talk about
uniformity amongst the phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said before, we're going to plant
50 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said 100 seeds before.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll plant 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, they're regs.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, 50 males have been removed
from the population.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got 50 females that look just like
each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is uniformity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is stability amongst that population
amongst those progeny there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're going to start with.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we get to that point?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I talked about earlier, breed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breed filial generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could start with whatever plants you
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend plants that are vastly
different in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this case, we're going to talk about
a rise.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to use a rise as our example.
[SPEAKER_01]: A rise was a cross I made several years
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have worked the a rise to F3 since then,
but let's focus a little more on this a
[SPEAKER_01]: rise.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I think made a rise successful was I
used a daybreaker male and a golden goat
[SPEAKER_01]: female to make that cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those plants are completely vastly
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since I took two plants that had no
matching characteristics, no traits that
[SPEAKER_01]: were similar when I bred those together,
it made a great combination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a rise was an amazing cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I recommend finding plants that are
vastly different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breed them together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Create your brand new cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then here's where we're going to start
working on the stability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find the phenotype you like out of that
first cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: The F1.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find the phenotype that really gets your
attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: The male and the female.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find that phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breed those together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're going to make F2s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the F2s, you're going to find a lot of
different wild phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The F2s are Pandora's box.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get a lot of crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find the phenotype you really like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to really start thinking about
what you should have already really been
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about what you want from this
cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you see what it expresses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really think what you want to narrow down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find a phenotype that has all of the
traits you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll talk about another option here
in just a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I remember, I'm going to write parallel
down because that's another thing to
[SPEAKER_01]: think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spelled it wrong, but it's a note.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so we're going to find our F2s.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing we're going to do, we're going
to find a plant that has the traits we
[SPEAKER_01]: want.
[SPEAKER_01]: The aroma, the structure, the shape,
the vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, resistance to powdery mildew,
resistance to bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find the male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find the female.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breed those together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: We just made F3.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to repeat that process,
finding the perfect phenotype every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't do it right, you will know
because when you grow the next generation,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not going to look how you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid to do it over again or go
backwards and do a back cross to the
[SPEAKER_01]: filial generation that has the traits that
you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're going to do, basically,
the easiest way to do this is to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: filial generation breeding this all the
way up to F5.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do this selection properly,
it's all about the selection, the male and
[SPEAKER_01]: the female, every generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do it properly, by the time you get
to the F5, definitely the F6, you will
[SPEAKER_01]: have uniform stability amongst the
phenotypes in that population.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you pop 100 seeds, you pull out 50
of the boys, all 50 of those remaining
[SPEAKER_01]: girls will look like you cut clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of plants that happen that
way in the horticultural industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the fruit and vegetables have
been filial generationed or genetically
[SPEAKER_01]: modified to appear that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can make that happen with your
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breed them to F5, F6, and you will find
uniformity amongst the population in that
[SPEAKER_01]: population if you have bred this properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, it's all about the selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breeding is all about selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could mess this up very easily,
and you could also make this happen
[SPEAKER_01]: perfectly very easily if you've got a good
eye for selection, a good eye for detail,
[SPEAKER_01]: and if you're realistic about what you are
looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pick a few certain traits and really
narrow those down if you're looking for 32
[SPEAKER_01]: traits to come out of one plant,
you're not going to lock that down in your
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that's where I'm going to talk about
this other option.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is called parallel breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do the same project,
just two different directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, let's just say we're going to focus
on Golden Goat to Daybreaker again.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to make a rise, but we're
going to make a rise version A and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to make a rise version B.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in version A, I'm only going to focus
on trichomes and flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all that matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: These plants could be ugly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can grow goofy as long as they taste
good and they're fully potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I care about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in the other project in line B,
that's where I need to have the beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: growth structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I need to have the resistance
to pathogens and resistance to bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really all I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are just hypotheticals that I
want to breed for in my two different
[SPEAKER_01]: lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to breed both of these lines
in different projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are totally different projects,
different male, different female,
[SPEAKER_01]: but same seed batches.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pulled seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a male that really is frosty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got another male that's really resistant
to bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two different breeding projects happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: A female on the other side, a female on
the other side to match my criteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two different projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to breed both of those to F5
or F6 until I've reached the stability
[SPEAKER_01]: that I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'm going to breed them together and
make my own true F1.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way I can get whichever, if I've got
a bunch of traits I'm looking for,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get that structure and that
resistance and that flavor and aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I get those, both of those lines to
F5 or F6, I can then breed them together
[SPEAKER_01]: and then I can combine all four of those
traits together in a brand new F1 because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're both going to be very dominant
traits on both sides of my cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then when I cross those together,
I'll get all the trichomes, all the
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get all the resistance and all the
structure and vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breed that together.
[SPEAKER_01]: My new F1 should have a lot of those
traits combined.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I've done it properly, then you get to
play with that brand new one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And keep going in filial generations with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is really how to breed for super
stability.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you ask why breeders aren't offering
plants that are super stable, why a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: us sell F1s, F2s, why we're doing
reversals, S1s, R1s, because it takes
[SPEAKER_01]: years and years to do these filial
generation projects, especially if you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to run parallel lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you're focused on,
you can kind of focus on making more seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: or working these lines, but it's hard to
do both to put the seeds out for
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really do what you need to do and
focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get one or the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found a really nice line in the middle
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do two or three seed production runs
and then just a personal run that is just
[SPEAKER_01]: for me to get data and fuck around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I've got a few different locations
where I'm able to play around with,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that helps me expand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let me stay focused here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you really want to get dialed in,
if you really want stable seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: make them, breed them, get to that F5
generation, breed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you could buy seeds from reliable
breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned buying seeds just a moment
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want seeds that have been bred to
the F5 generation, the only breeder I
[SPEAKER_01]: really know of that is doing that is DJ
Short.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to DJ Short for putting
those out commercially available.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've made a rise F3s, but I've not made
them available because there are not a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not enough of them to make it
worth putting out on that sort of a level.
[SPEAKER_01]: The F4s and F5s, those will hit the
website, but those are years away.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a while away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where were we now?
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you get stable seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Define stable, we did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breed them to the F5, buy seeds from a
reliable breeder such as DJ Short,
[SPEAKER_01]: or if you really want to get involved,
breed them, do that project yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is how you find uniform and
phenotypically stable plants, if that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, we did touch on those sexually
stable plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sell very sexually stable plants,
if that's what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is very advantageous to you
because you, my friend Megatron,
[SPEAKER_01]: have got a coupon code for a free pack of
seeds at iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, podcast world, that's all the
