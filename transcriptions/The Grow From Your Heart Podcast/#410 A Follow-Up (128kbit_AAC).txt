[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Show Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 410 of the Grow From
Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by Oregon Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds in your garden,
I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can find them at www.oregoneliteseeds
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I've been dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I've been smoking on the Mai Tai
Full Spectrum Extract from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a cross of the Sunset Sherb and
Purple Punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, the flavor is described as
Tropical Fruit Cocktail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would totally agree with the Tropical
Fruit Cocktail.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also something real Jolly Rancher
and kind of sweet candy flavored in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really sticks around on your mouth for
a long time and it makes the room smell
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you smoke some dabs, I left the
room, I came back and it smelled amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really enjoying the Mai Tai Full
Spectrum Extract from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back it says it contains 65.41%
total THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright Podcast World, I am recording on a
cold April evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you hear some smacking noises or some
weird random noises in the background,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is because we are currently
experiencing a windstorm that is including
[SPEAKER_00]: small bursts of hail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you hear weird noises in the
background, hopefully that is just the
[SPEAKER_00]: wind and the hail beating against the side
of my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really hope all of this weather passes
and clears up quickly because this weekend
[SPEAKER_00]: is the weekend of the Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, it cultivated synergy on
April 13th.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be attending and vending at the
Dude Grows Cup in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to seeing everybody there
come say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time this comes out, it will be
really close to cup time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are interested in attending the
cup, send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is growfromyourheart at
hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will forward your information to the
Dude and the Dude will get you all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: information you need to either enter or
attend the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do encourage you to enter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are accepting 50 entries at last
count.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were about 40, so there still may be
room by the time this episode comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, if you're interested in
attending or entering the Dude Grows Cup
[SPEAKER_00]: at the last minute, send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will see if it is still an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will forward your contact info to the
Dude and the Dude will get in touch with
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will also have the debut of the Blue
Raspberry Truffles at the Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be the first few packs available
at that event, so come say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I do have a lot to talk about
in this episode, but before we get to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to do a few shout-outs from
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a giant shout-out to my
friend Joseph G., a big shout-out to
[SPEAKER_00]: Bafsta.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big shout-out to Eric Ross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe a big thank you to Glenn Jerome,
a giant Rasta fist bump to Remy Redeye,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a big Grow From Your Heart thank you
to my friend Full Monty.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few episodes back, I talked about using
CO2 in your garden, and somebody asked if
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommended or suggested turning off or
reducing CO2 late in flower or at some
[SPEAKER_00]: point in the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommended to use CO2 throughout the
entire grow cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you can start using it,
start using it and use it and increase it
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way up to harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I received a comment on my YouTube video
from a viewer, and the comment goes like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, hey Rasta Jeff, thank you for
all you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the guy asking about stopping CO2
in flower was talking about comments from
[SPEAKER_00]: Ocean Grown Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few of their breeders strongly
recommended stopping CO2 at week six of
[SPEAKER_00]: flower to avoid too much leaf production.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's from a friend on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they want their name said
on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you scroll and troll the
YouTube channel long enough, you will find
[SPEAKER_00]: their comment and you will know who they
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am going to completely disagree with
the recommendation of another breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I am going to do it completely
respectfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the rest of their grow
tactics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not doing everything the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are probably doing everything
completely differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing has a lot of freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of options.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of techniques and tactics,
and many of them will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said before, the only way you're
doing it wrong is if the plants die or if
[SPEAKER_00]: you are not happy with the final outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got nothing but love and respect for
the folks over at Ocean Grown Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know their growing method.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like they may recommend that we
stop using CO2 around week six.
[SPEAKER_00]: I respectfully disagree.
[SPEAKER_00]: They recommend to stop doing it because it
produces too much leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am known for defoliating quite heavily
throughout the entire flowering process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So creating too much leaf is not really a
problem for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to go in and defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like spending time in the garden
doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a crew that does it in a large
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So too much leaf is really not an issue
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm defoliating anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in there taking out leaves to increase
light penetration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in there taking out leaves to increase
airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in there taking out leaves just to
minimize the amount of leaf in the room
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes time to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps with respiration and
transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps keep the VPD in line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think it's very advantageous to
defoliate heavily throughout the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: period anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we grow differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not disrespecting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not arguing with that company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying we do it differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not how I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel that you may get a lot of leaf
development if you're using a lot of CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: and certain nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you get a lot of bud development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it is worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a positive trade-off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do it differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not disrespecting anybody again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely respect everybody's grow
method as long as it is working for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, that is not the way I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're following my grow method,
if you're using all of my grow methods and
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques and lessons, I would recommend
continuing the CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to grow with the way the other
guys taught you, do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it works for you, do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what works for you and makes you happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or try to make a hybrid of all of the
above as long as it works out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as the plants are happy and as
long as you are happy with the final
[SPEAKER_00]: outcome, everything is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that other company and myself,
we just do it differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: No hatred, no animosity, just different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, different bands
playing different songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my answer to that YouTube
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you for the great YouTube
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like answering the YouTube comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it would be easier for myself and
it would probably be more beneficial for
[SPEAKER_00]: you and more likely to get your question
answered and acknowledged if you reach out
[SPEAKER_00]: to me through email.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best way to get a hold of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do love the YouTube comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please keep leaving those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want something answered
directly, the email is your best bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and if we were having a conversation
on Instagram on my iRee underscore
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics account, I did not block you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not abandon the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram has taken down that account.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am doing my best to get the account
back, but I cannot make any promises.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another account.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is rostajeff710 on Instagram,
but I haven't posted anything but a
[SPEAKER_00]: profile picture on that account.
[SPEAKER_00]: So follow me there if you'd like to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the meantime, I will try to get
back the original iRee underscore genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram account.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I would like to read
some Apple podcast customer reviews on
[SPEAKER_00]: this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to leave a review on
Apple podcasts, all you have to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: most of you are probably using an iPhone
or some sort of an Apple device.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you open up your podcasting app and you
go to the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing this right now so I can give you
a really good description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open up the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the available episodes
right under there, it says best of the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep scrolling right past where it gives
you best of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it comes to ratings and reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either click all and you can read
all of the ratings and reviews,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you can write a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little tab you click,
write a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also gives you the option to leave an
amount of stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can leave up to a five star rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, most folks have left a five star
rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking on my phone so I can't see the
exact amount of stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows me that at least one or two
people have left a one and a four star
[SPEAKER_00]: rating, which is just fine with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to leave the amount of
stars which you feel I deserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, type in a little comment and
let everybody know what you think about
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read some recent reviews for
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes from somebody who calls himself
Darth Knight III.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was left on February 28th.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline is the cannabis content I've
been craving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the review goes a little bit like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am planning my first grow and was very
excited to find this show and it is no
[SPEAKER_00]: disappointment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff paints a vivid picture and has a
passion for educating people in all
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sounds kind of like Joe Rogan,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: This show is so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just let the podcast play over the shop
stereo for hours while we work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that is a great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that you found us while you're
planning your first grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you have checked out the grow
lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope those did you very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy that you think I paint a vivid
picture and I'm glad that you can see my
[SPEAKER_00]: passion for educating and my passion for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis means a lot and I want to dispel
all of the rumors about cannabis and I
[SPEAKER_00]: want people to just do the best with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it in the best light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad that you see that and thank
you for trying to do that for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you say Mike is awesome?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Mike is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike is a cool dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a good bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a good father.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a good husband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just one bad motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mike is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for being my bro, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for noticing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you say he sounds like Joe Rogan,
in your opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably mean Mike because I don't
think I sound like Rogan.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to have somebody on the show called
like Rogan, you got the word Rogan in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always a compliment to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show is so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just let it play over the shop stereo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious what kind of shop you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a retail shop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it where you're working?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there more people walking in and being
exposed to the show as you're listening to
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mind gets curious when you say you're
playing it in a public area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes me want to know who's listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But man, I'm glad more people are being
exposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you're playing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of all, I'm glad you love the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big thanks for listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks for the great review and extra
big thanks for that five star rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a few more comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get right to the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next one comes from a person who
calls themselves Willie's armpit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Willie's armpit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that name for some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline says bad memories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's read this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says love the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very informative with easy to follow
descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely love the idea of having all the
past episodes to refer to.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 87, I tried my first indoor grow with
absolutely no idea what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a miserable failure it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't it so much easier now that we've got
the Internet and a little bit of guidance?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so glad I can help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The review keeps going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says if I only if only I had someone
like Rasta Jeff, I could have listened to
[SPEAKER_00]: every Monday and Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might not have wasted those huge
watermelon sized skunk seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I bet those were great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry we wasted those, but we've got
more seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say it was the nastiest
skunk smell oozing from the bags at that
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: For years in Florida, you could not count
on the skunk bud between or you could
[SPEAKER_00]: count on the skunk bud between October and
December like clockwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deliciously nasty skunk bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're making my mouth water every time
you say that you were in love with that
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think my taste buds and my nose are
into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we love the most disgusting,
like the worst aromas are really the best
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like it kind of smells like
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The review continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says never to be smelled again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm heartbroken.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just built myself up to get my heart
broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's miserable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says what I would give for another
try at those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bad memories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you're a seed shopper,
if you were into shopping for seeds on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Internet, I would recommend you find
something called roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can find some good roadkill skunk,
they'll be hard to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not be available on a lot of the
commercial websites, but if you can find
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the RKS, grow that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get some of that old, nasty,
disgusting, delicious skunk smell that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am sorry and you're welcome that I'm
bringing back terrible memories of your
[SPEAKER_00]: failed grow experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now that you've got me around,
now that you've got the Internet,
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully we can fix that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully your next grow is top notch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we can put some fresh new
memories in your head and wipe out that
[SPEAKER_00]: old memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe you can compare the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll leave them both in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably smoke enough for that old
memory is kind of hazy anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get you growing some new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got some grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got some good guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got some good advice and I'll
answer your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get you growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get you a new harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can look at the new harvest
and then you can try to remember back on
[SPEAKER_00]: that old one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can just feel proud inside for how
much you've improved and how much you've
[SPEAKER_00]: learned and how far you've come.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Willie Zarpitt, I'm glad that you find
the episodes to be informative and easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you like my descriptions and I'm
glad that you were learning along with the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know how your next crop goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's erase those bad memories and replace
them with some pride.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Willie Zarpitt, thanks again for the
great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, Willie Zarpitt and The Dark
Knight gave us five star reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to both of you for those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next one comes from a person who
calls themselves Dean221.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave us a five star rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: The review goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most informative and entertaining grow
show ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should just stop reading right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, I should keep going because it says
Rasta Jeff is my hero.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the coolest review ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most informative I like that you didn't
say best because best is a relative term.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that you feel I am the most
informative as well as the most
[SPEAKER_00]: entertaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being your hero is kind of a lot of
pressure and you need better heroes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to play that one down
because I don't know what to say about
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's continue with the review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I am brand new to stealth growing
personal medicine and I listen constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 63 and I feel born again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks Rasta.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is great to be a 63 year old person's
hero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually we look up to somebody who is our
senior and I've got somebody who is my
[SPEAKER_00]: senior looking up to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are brand new to stealth growing your
personal medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions, please send me
an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will answer your questions via email.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to read them on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can keep them between us since you are
stealth growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you may be in somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't discuss everything on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So send me questions if you've got them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe send me a few good questions and I
will put together another stealth growing
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those always seem to be a lot of fun and
keep listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of all, thank you for the great
review and also thank you for the five
[SPEAKER_00]: star rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dean 2 2 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to getting some emails
with stealth growing questions from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next review comes from a person who
calls themselves Daddy Oh 45.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave us a five star rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline of the review is Rasta Jeff
and White Mike killing it once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the review goes just like this killer
show like always.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, it's a white Mike episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were they thought they were
commenting on a specific episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Mike, it looks like people are
enjoying your episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to find time to come back and
record more frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend, they keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: The review says that means it's a very fun
and informative show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all the advice that seems to
just fall out of your guys' minds when you
[SPEAKER_00]: two get together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks for the great compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for the great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for the five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will pass the message along to Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is probably listening, so he's going to
hear it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Mike, people do approve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come record, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss hanging out, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have got another review.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is titled.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one they gave us a five star
rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is left by our friend Glenn
Jerome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Glenn Jerome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: The review goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic content, specific, actionable,
and clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those were the exact goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love how Jeff doesn't babble in tribal
knowledge and bro science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I try to make things
understandable for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad it doesn't seem like I'm
bro-sciencing things when I do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want everybody to be able to enjoy and
appreciate the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want everybody to be able to learn from
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who are thinking about buying a
gross setup and people that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: running commercial facilities,
I want them both to be entertained.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes I do have to take a huge
concept and kind of make it a little
[SPEAKER_00]: simplified for the new people to figure it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also have to stay entertaining for
the people who have been doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you don't find it to be
bro-sciency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that is what I think I'm
trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says this show, along with the DGC,
that is the Dude Grow Show, have brought
[SPEAKER_00]: me from growing some slightly dank popcorn
baby buds to cultivating massive dank
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm glad we could improve your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the main goal here is to get
everybody growing massive dank buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad we got you up to speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The review continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I look forward to each episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I will take a fat dad and give my
mom a hug for both of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love, Brother Glenn in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those folks in Oklahoma are killing it
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oklahoma is kind of the new Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the wild, wild west.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys are having a great time
while you can down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy it while it lasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying it's going to go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will tighten up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, it's the wild, wild west.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're running freestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it while you can, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, Glenn Giron, thanks for the great
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the five-star rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, thanks for the great
compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dude, thanks for doing a great job in
your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you've gone from little popcorn
buds to massive dank buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that between the Dude Grow Show
and myself, we were able to get you up to
[SPEAKER_00]: speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all my friends at the
Dude Grow Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that we've got a good network going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got one more customer review to read
in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from a friend who calls
himself Charlie Moody.
[SPEAKER_00]: The title of the review is Really Enjoying
This.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, we got another five-star
rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: The review goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started... Oh, where did it go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Screen move.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started with the Planning Your Grow
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I got to the repeats, I went back to
the early hundreds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just finished number 161.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, you've heard a lot of content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you did very well by starting
with the Planning Your Grow episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're all the way back to 161.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have listened to a lot of content.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I appreciate the
detail, the wealth of experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the good humor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that in all of the reviews,
every time I read a batch of reviews,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's always one person that mentions
the attempt at humor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that somebody enjoys it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to have fun with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not have fun in school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love learning, but I did not like
sitting some more for eight hours,
[SPEAKER_00]: being told that I can't tap my foot or
that I can't just stare off into space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just staring off into space because
that's how my brain absorbs stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want me to look at the teacher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just didn't like being there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had teachers that were entertaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had teachers that told me jokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the classes that I chose to go
to more frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later on in my school career, there were a
lot of classes I would skip because the
[SPEAKER_00]: teacher was not enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hated that class.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wouldn't go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the teacher was better, if he was
funny, if she was funny, I had much more
[SPEAKER_00]: of a chance of going to that class.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to teach with a little bit of
humor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it makes everything stick a little
bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fill you up with a whole bunch of
knowledge and then I just seal it in there
[SPEAKER_00]: with a joke so that you kind of,
whole bunch of stuff, whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, and then a joke so it doesn't feel
stressful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normal learning can be kind of stressful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to cram a bunch of stuff into your
brain can kind of be stressful and
[SPEAKER_00]: overwhelming sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you tell a joke at the end,
wash it off with a little bit of laughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully a lot of that knowledge retains
and then it doesn't feel stressful at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you enjoy my attempt at humor
and I want to give you a big thank you for
[SPEAKER_00]: the great review and also a big thanks for
the five star rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody that has left an
iTunes customer review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really does help us move up in the
iTunes rankings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps more people see the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more people that see the show,
the more people are growing better
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is our goal here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want everybody growing the best
cannabis possible.
