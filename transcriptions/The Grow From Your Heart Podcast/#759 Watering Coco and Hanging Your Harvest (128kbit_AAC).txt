[SPEAKER_00]: for details, for more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, that is dudegrows.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last episode, I did mention that I
was experiencing a power outage the day
[SPEAKER_00]: before, and I thought it was kind of silly
that I did not talk at all about
[SPEAKER_00]: precautions and measurements taken during
a power outage in my grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something I want to ramble about
here for just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first things I want to
recommend is if you think you may,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if you don't think you're going to
experience a power outage, you probably
[SPEAKER_00]: will at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to prevent problems when those power
outages do come, one thing that I would
[SPEAKER_00]: highly recommend for your grow,
and I do a lot of things quite highly,
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking of being quite highly today,
I did take some dabs of some lens and
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeffrey concentrates made by a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't talk too much about who made it
or how it got here, but we can talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: how much it wrecked me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel a little bit goofy, a little bit
off in a very good way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not complaining about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like I got pleasantly punched
right in the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I got a pie shoved right in my
face, and I'm just over here dazed and
[SPEAKER_00]: confused by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: These lights are super bright,
but it doesn't matter because I can't pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to anything except what's
directly in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the camera on the screen here,
that's basically all I can focus on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thought I should mention that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, back to my recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend that in your grow,
in any grow space, if you anticipate or do
[SPEAKER_00]: not anticipate the power going out,
I highly recommend a timer that has a
[SPEAKER_00]: backup battery in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, a lot of you have that timer
that plugs directly into the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you plug your light into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You spin the dial and set the time
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You push the up and down knobs to show you
when you want it off and on, and then it
[SPEAKER_00]: just turns and the things click
accordingly goes off and on as you set it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens when the power goes out?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a timer with a battery backup
in that timer, the time keeps spinning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the power does come back on in
your building, facility, home,
[SPEAKER_00]: office, wherever the grow may be,
then it gets right back on its regularly
[SPEAKER_00]: scheduled program.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't miss any time other than what
it was out naturally that you couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have that battery backup on
your timer, the power in your facility
[SPEAKER_00]: goes off, the power to the timer goes off,
and it quits turning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes back on, now it is
whatever time when the power went out,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's just say it was right now,
it's five 56.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was five 56 when the power went off,
it'll be five 56 for the entire duration
[SPEAKER_00]: of your power outage.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes back on, it's five 56.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, my lights come on at nine and go
off at nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be proper anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: If my lights are off for one, if the power
is out for an hour, I'm an hour off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm out for two hours, I'm two hours
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be a perfect hour
duration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise you nothing in life works that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be like an hour and 47
minutes and then your timers are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be all fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things will come back on and they'll
reset themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things won't even come back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to make sure that timer comes on and
stays on the regular schedule,
[SPEAKER_00]: which you had it, I would recommend a
timer with the backup battery,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially for your lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need the lights to stay on a very
critical schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is okay to interrupt the day cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your lights are on and you need to turn
them off for an hour to spray,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe an hour and a half to apply a spray
application, then turn them back on,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if the power goes out for an hour and a
half while the lights are on, that is
[SPEAKER_00]: okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: There won't be a problem if there are
interruptions in the day cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: What will freak your plants out is if
there are interruptions within the night
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are down to take a nap during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take a nap during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not going to piss me off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You tell me you got to go lay down for an
hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take a dab, grab my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go to lay down for an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really want to, but I mean,
we'll do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good excuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some fucking rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you wake me up in the middle
of the night by turning some lights on and
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking up my sleep cycle, I'm going to be
kind of annoyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants have the same idea with life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to interrupt the dark
cycle, but it's okay to interrupt the day
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle with darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you interrupt that nighttime cycle,
that's when you really do increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to encourage the intersex
trait that could be in that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing I recommend, if you don't
have the backup battery timer,
[SPEAKER_00]: as soon as your power does come back on,
get everything back on that regularly
[SPEAKER_00]: scheduled program as soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the power goes out when you're
not home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it went off and came back on and you
don't even know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check all of your timers occasionally
just to make sure that things are in sync
[SPEAKER_00]: the way that you think they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could prevent a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're walking around the grow
looking for pests to see if there's any
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs present in the room, when you're
looking for other problems, just look and
[SPEAKER_00]: see are all of the timers on the time,
which I think they are set for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I should mention,
if the power is going to be, if they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be working on the power,
let's just say that hypothetically that
[SPEAKER_00]: the transformer behind your house blew up
and it went out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they came and they got the new
transformer up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every couple of minutes, it's like
they're plugging it in and unplugging it
[SPEAKER_00]: and plugging it in and unplugging it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just fucking with it to see if it works as
they hook it up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Touch the wire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't touch the wire.
[SPEAKER_00]: The power in the house allegedly may have
been going off and on randomly while that
[SPEAKER_00]: was happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could hear the fans go.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would just start up and they would
die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could see the light flicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as it would get to full power,
the lights would die again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was happening throughout the whole
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the main concerning part was the
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to have things like that
happening, just go unplug all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go and do the lights, go and do the
air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not good for your equipment or your
plants to get that sort of weird random
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule abuse sort of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just leave it dark for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to cause you any problems
unless you get big humidity spikes or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're just going to have to deal with
that when the power comes back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's going crazy randomly and you're
getting power off and on a lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: just go unplug it so that you don't blow
up any bulbs, blow up any bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any ballast cause any problems with your
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier on the gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier on your plants just to go
unplug all your shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then put it back on when everything is
fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't undo the timers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave the timers plugged in right where
they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you've got timers with the
backup battery, they'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unplug from the timers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull the cords out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a big power box.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just unplugged the power box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is all undone at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't overload your breakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a very important thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not related to just a random power
outage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is related to everything when you're
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't overload the breakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put too many amps in one breaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do silly shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the breaker is flipping too often,
that's a warning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you keep fixing that breaker,
the breaker, hopefully the breaker will
[SPEAKER_00]: burn out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, the other option is that either
the outlet, the plugin in which you're
[SPEAKER_00]: plugging your overloaded device into
probably a thousand watt HPS light in a
[SPEAKER_00]: bedroom or two lights in a bedroom is
probably what you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to keep flipping that
breaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully the breaker flips and burns out
inside the breaker box.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be a big sign says,
Hey, quit fucking doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your other option is that the inlet,
the outlet, the plugin where you plug in
[SPEAKER_00]: the light that could catch on fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other options are that the wires melt
and catch on fire and cause a short
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere else in the house, which could
cause another fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't overload shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overloading things electrically will
definitely cause the risk of fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more electricity, the more potential
of the fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: The older the house, the more potential
for older bad wiring, the more potential
[SPEAKER_00]: for shitty breakers, shitty sockets,
more potential for disaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be that guy or girl that burns down
the house growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please let's not be that person.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's already enough bad publicity,
enough bad shit on the news about cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not be those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of being those people,
if you're going to grow, have a smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: alarm, have a fire extinguisher ready and
understand how to use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the battery goes out in that smoke
alarm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just take it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to beep at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be so annoying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to beep right in the middle of
a podcast and piss you off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go tear it off the ceiling and smash
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a battery in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Save your life, save your family,
save the home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also save the neighbors, save your image,
save our reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's enough on catching up
talking about power outages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt it was a very good opportunity to
talk about that since the power was going
[SPEAKER_00]: out here, was out here for several hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine being at home with just no
electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Felt like a caveman with no power here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had to grab the phone, plug the phone in
the car to charge it up and just go drive
[SPEAKER_00]: around and listen to music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, it was a beautiful night,
a little bit of rain, nice and cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm just fucking rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friend who sent me the
lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I want to talk about,
this is just a random thing that I have
[SPEAKER_00]: observed over the past few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been driving a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you pay attention to my social media,
my life at all, if you're included,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know that I have been driving a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went through an oil change in like four
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need an oil change already.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only been four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just remembered I needed an oil change
of blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: We said that out loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I've noticed, I've got some
shoulder pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it might be from driving because
when I go like this, I can feel right
[SPEAKER_00]: about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't feel so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not killing me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you ever notice that sometimes when
you smoke, if you've got pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: then sometimes it makes the pain go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But have you ever smoked and felt the pain
just completely throb or get worse?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that I have experienced
lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: One night I smoked a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ate a bunch of edibles and smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shoulder felt great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next night took a couple of dabs and I
was like, here's where it hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just started throbbing right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really weird experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wondered if you guys have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thought I'd ramble and share.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also another question, do you guys go
through that phase where I do this,
[SPEAKER_00]: where I can smoke all of the dabs on the
planet and eat all of the edibles on the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet and not get lit?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also I have some days where I
could take like two dabs and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to take a nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growfromyourheartathotmail.com or hit me
up on Twitter at GFYHpodcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have phases where you can smoke all
the buds, all the herbs, all the flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: eat all the edibles, smoke all the
concentrates and not get super lit?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then do you have other times where it
flips, where just looking at the jar will
[SPEAKER_00]: get you too high?
[SPEAKER_00]: To manage your own business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did say I was going to answer some
emails in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got super rambly here at the start of
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, shout out to Lemon Jeffery.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first email on today's show comes from
a friend who would rather remain
[SPEAKER_00]: anonymous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question goes a little bit like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, yo Rasta Jeff, thanks for all you
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, thank you for listening and thank you
for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, my question is this, why do we
dry our plants upside down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this just for convenience or is there
another purpose?
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to me it would be easier to trim
them if they were dried upright.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to remain anonymous, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do feel like I've got a really good
solid answer for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do cut down the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hang them upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We let them hang until they're dry enough
to start chopping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, we trim them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get them into jars and actually
start the curing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we hang them?
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, in my experience,
hanging them, first of all, is the most
[SPEAKER_00]: convenient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really easy and it takes the least
amount of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, if we were to put our buds on a
shelf or a rack or a table, there's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a flat spot on
whatever we set that bud down on.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people will use it's a little
drying rack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hanging drying rack, basically a
weed hammock, a weed hotel, if you will,
[SPEAKER_00]: to dry the buds in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mesh hanger that the plant sits in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are cool because they're kind of
bouncy, but they also create a flat spot
[SPEAKER_00]: on the bottom of the bud that doesn't dry
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to hang it because then the entire
plant is exposed to the airflow,
[SPEAKER_00]: the air, all evenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get it even dry throughout the
whole plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't get a flat spot that looks ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't get a bottom that's not getting
dry, and it doesn't change the shape and
[SPEAKER_00]: appearance of our bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it is, not only is it really
convenient, it makes it super easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just hanging all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need a bunch of shelf space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can run a bunch of lines and just hang
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super convenient.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, then they dry more evenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no flat spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing's touching.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're suspended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prevents the opportunity for mold and
other issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you did say that you would prefer to
dry them standing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is, unless you're hanging them
from the tip, which is a bud, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: part you don't really want, you could hang
it from the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could figure out how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're gonna fall over.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just gonna tip over unless you
hang it from the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flip it upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll hang that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves will go this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said it would probably be easier to
trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut off a lot of the leaf before we even
get to that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the plant is still growing the day
before harvest, I go in and pull off a
[SPEAKER_00]: good portion of any big leaf and a leaf
with a petiole.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes off at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those leaves aren't even in the room
for the drying cure process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are already gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I take those all off, chop it upside,
chop it, hang it upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few days later, bust all the buds off of
the sticks, then go cut off all the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves, then give it a final trim,
then finish the final drying cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we hang it upside down because it makes
it more evenly dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be some weird wives' tales,
some hippie stories about draining the
[SPEAKER_00]: resin from the bottom of the plant to the
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't have anything to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all a myth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all bro science.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is fake because if that were true,
then wouldn't just all the THC come to
[SPEAKER_00]: just the main top bud, which is now at the
very bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not real.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is because it dries more evenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is why.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do look forward to follow up questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is another question right here in
the stack of emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, this question comes from our
friend, Frosty the Plant Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my dude, Frosty the Plant
Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey, would you be able to help on
feeding in cocoa?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am using 70 30 cocoa from Eco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, also I should mention our friend is in
the UK and I am not sure what they mean by
[SPEAKER_00]: Eco.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is probably peat moss or probably
perlite, but either way, we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure this out because it'll be similar
answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're using a 70 30 mix, which is
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I see loads of different
approaches with a once a day, once every
[SPEAKER_00]: other day or multiple times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a correct method to watering
cocoa?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also on the multiple feed, would you look
at getting runoff every feeding the quick
[SPEAKER_00]: answer?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want runoff on every single feeding when
it comes to cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want 10 to 20% runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, maybe even a little bit more,
depending on how often and the size of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pots and more things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, I do want runoff every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about feeding
in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're using cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a 70 30 base, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what size pots you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're auto watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure about a couple of things
here, but we can dial this in and figure
[SPEAKER_00]: this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're asking about how many times,
how often you should be watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really depends on the dry downtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would water to 20% runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you're able to do this,
I don't know how often you're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got a camera, but this is
what I would do personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go to the grow first thing in the
morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would water to 20% runoff every single
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would set a timer and then I would
watch the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as one or two of the plants
start showing me, Hey, I'm kind of pissed
[SPEAKER_00]: off, I would hit my timer button or make a
note.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say the first couple of plants
start looking pissed off at this many
[SPEAKER_00]: hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would start paying attention to
where the average of the room looks pissed
[SPEAKER_00]: off at a certain amount of hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you really want to get crazy,
wait another hour or two and see how long
[SPEAKER_00]: it takes for plants to get really pissed
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing this shit for science,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a note of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hypothetically, I'm going to make up
some numbers because again, I'm not in
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow, your pot size, your VPD,
your lighting, everything in this room is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to make a difference on how often
you need to water because it will make a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference on how quickly or slowly your
pots, your medium, your containers do dry
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go with six hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say, let's just say that right
at the six hour market looked like the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants would have been really happy to get
water again, the entire room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're running multiple strains,
if you can dial in multiple tables,
[SPEAKER_00]: do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's just talk about the average of
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say that right at six hours,
all of the tables looked like it'd be
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect if we water them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's set that timer for six hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's watch again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's water them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then set a timer for six more hours and
watch again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they go six hours again and need water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what we just learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to water them four times a day,
six hours apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water them to 20% runoff, wait six hours,
water them again at 20% runoff and
[SPEAKER_00]: continue this.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the plants grow, they may need more
frequent watering or they simply may need
[SPEAKER_00]: more water per watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be things that you as the
farmer need to dial in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to assume that when they get
larger, if you're watering four times a
[SPEAKER_00]: day, late in veg, all the way through the
end of flower, you may be hitting them six
[SPEAKER_00]: or eight times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on, like I said,
the VPD of the room, the size of the
[SPEAKER_00]: container.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using four by four, you're using
cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're using a six by six pot,
you've got the opportunity to water 20
[SPEAKER_00]: times a day because that's not going to
hold much water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a seven gallon pot,
you're only going to water two times or
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe one time because there's going to be
a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial grow, I typically use
three gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people want a five gallon pot just
because owners are owners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a consultant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the cultivation director,
but that doesn't mean that the whole team
[SPEAKER_00]: follows what I say every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish, but humans are humans and owners
are owners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the time I'm using three gallon
containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer either a three gallon fabric pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't want to pay for the three
gallon fabric pot, we use a three gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: grow bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite way to go in a commercial grow
with drip irrigation with one or two water
[SPEAKER_00]: emitters per plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got my three gallons of amended
cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got probably 70 to 75% cocoa with 25
to 30% perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like that airy fluffy mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lets me not overwater is something that
it helps me do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's too much water in there and not
enough room for air, the roots can get
[SPEAKER_00]: crushed when they're little.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they get bigger, it's not as big of a
deal, but I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just does help me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: for commercial growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got my three gallon container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my 70 30 mix, my 75 25 ish mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my two emitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We water or I or they or it will get
watered first thing in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, as soon as we start up to
grow, one of the first things we do is mix
[SPEAKER_00]: up the water and hit the big flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that room will get watered first thing
in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we got there at eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it depends on what facility
usually go in at eight, usually leave at
[SPEAKER_00]: six.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will check the plants around five o
'clock and decide do they need their
[SPEAKER_00]: second watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants get big.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not exaggerating when I say that in a
commercial grill, you guys are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: think I'm crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got pictures I can show you this and
they're people that will testify.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike was the metric guy, the guy in charge
of all the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: When these plants are harvested,
they are wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is their wet weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me say that very clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the weight of the wet plants at
harvest coming from a three gallon pot
[SPEAKER_00]: with most of the leaves defoliated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants would weigh somewhere between
2000 and 3000 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are big fucking plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were growing those in three gallon
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those would get watered at eight in the
morning and six p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's about 12 hours apart,
but we were leaving.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't going to be there at eight p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were going to water them at six p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights are going to go out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dark period would buy us a couple of
hours of not watering since they aren't as
[SPEAKER_00]: functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heat's not as high in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could water them at eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd be ready for water again by about
six or seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd hit them at five or six so we could
clean up and go home.
[SPEAKER_00]: People got to go home.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't be there all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to send people home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's shit to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to go to another grow probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'd water them again at six and then
we come back at eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're ready for water again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a three gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most of those facilities, we are
running double ended Gavita lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say they're 1,100 watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're 1,000 watt lights, but they do put
out a lot of heat, a lot of electricity,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of lumens, a lot of par watts,
whatever you want to measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants are really growing and really
cooking under those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm watering twice in those.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your pots are smaller than three
gallons, if you got a one gallon pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking at watering four to six
times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to have big 3,000 gram
plants come out of that, but you're still
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have to keep that medium wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way that I would do it,
I'm going to recap a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way to do this is to turn on the
water, water till you get runoff,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20% runoff, then stop watering,
then set a timer, see how long you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: go between waterings.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the plants look like they need water
again, make a note, look at your timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been six hours, eight hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Repeat that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that during the dark cycle,
they may not drink as much water as they
[SPEAKER_00]: do during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have as much heat to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not as high of a VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're putting out a little bit more
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not sucking up as much water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may not have to water as often
during the night cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be wise to stick around one night
and just stick your finger in some pots
[SPEAKER_00]: and pick up some pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out water tech one through five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that's a really good episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing in cocoa, water tech one
through five is a really good episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't think of the episode number off
the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you watch the video, the episode number
will pop up right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, somebody will leave it in the
comments for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water tech one through five, really good
episode will help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do it quickly because I'm not going
to recap the entire episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say that when you put your,
you're using cocoa, this method works for
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa for a soil, for soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how I teach people how to water
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say that you fill the pot with
cocoa or with your mix, whatever gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you got a three gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to use a three gallon pot for
this example.
[SPEAKER_00]: We fill it with our mix and there's no
water in it and you pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're fired.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plant ever gets that dry,
you're fired.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's all the way water it all the
way until there's water fucking pouring
[SPEAKER_00]: out of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a five.
[SPEAKER_00]: As heavy as it gets, pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick up this pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is fucking sopping wet with water
and it's super heavy, remember that
[SPEAKER_00]: weight, that's a five.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it dries up a little bit and it's
more not soggy, but just wet at the ideal
[SPEAKER_00]: condition for a plant, that's a four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's going to dry up a little bit
where you're going, we might need to water
[SPEAKER_00]: this soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you get to the two where it's
like, hey bro, are you going to water that
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one is where it's bone dry and
you're fired.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to ask you any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go, what happened to that plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Go home.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I did ask a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked what the fuck happened,
but I already know it got too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Clock out, go home, update your resume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water tech one through five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, it's bone dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super light when you pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, it's got a little bit of
weight to it when you pick it up,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the plant looks like it needs water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number three, that's the sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you're like, oh, we should
water it soon, but if we water it now,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's number three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number four is like, oh, it's almost over
watered, but it's just right because we
[SPEAKER_00]: just watered it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it one hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number five, it's like how much fucking
water are you going to give that plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's basically water tech one through
five.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to hover right around number
three, like a 2.5 to a 3.5 is right in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet spot there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number five, the plants are struggling to
get oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, the plants are struggling to
get water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay right in the middle there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that beautiful balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is water tech one through five
recapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get back on my notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get myself back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I did get quite rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, shout out to my friend with
the lemon Jeffrey concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit got me all weird today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help me feeding in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I covered that people different
approaches once every other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely not every other day,
unless you got big pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I gave you advice on how to figure
that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do want runoff with every single
watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you were watering multiple times a
day, I would recommend you do get watering
[SPEAKER_00]: runoff every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, the salts will build up in that
cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things will stick in the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other things will not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you go to water,
you think you're feeding one thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're actually not because there's
other shit just sitting in the soil or in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cocoa or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it will get absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next time you water, you'll be
doubling up your PPMs of something and not
[SPEAKER_00]: even realize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does say another question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mind answering another question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one was free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will bill you for this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check for an invoice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, is there a reason why I can feed
my cocoa with a 5.8 pH feeding to check
[SPEAKER_00]: runoff?
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it'll be as low as 5.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would there be a reason or is something
not to worry about?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if you're going to like
my answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: My answer is, if you ask me this in
person, if you're like, bro, why is my
[SPEAKER_00]: runoff 5.0?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd say, well, what did you feed it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd say 5.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my next question is going to be,
are you growing runoff or are you growing
[SPEAKER_00]: ganja plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: My next question would be, how do the
plants look?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, are the plants happy?
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants look good, I don't worry
about the runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do document the runoff, but I don't,
it doesn't concern me until I see a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem with the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only use the runoff as a clue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, if there's a problem,
I don't change anything based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at the plants first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a rant that I don't know if I've
done this on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've said this like on Instagram
live and other shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I've done this here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's time to just do it again,
because maybe you don't listen to every
[SPEAKER_00]: episode like I think people may,
but I feel like the younger generation of
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, we have a lot of great toys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got, they have, we have a lot of
great technology at our fingertips and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very affordable now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can buy monitors, meters,
gauges, buzzers, devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, we can almost make the plants
talk to us, except we can't get that far.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can almost do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get all the data that we need on a
computer screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing that I think we're losing
track of is when somebody says there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: issue with the plants, we go look at the
computer screen and look at the meters,
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the monitors, which is cool,
but what about looking at the plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the plants are over there telling you
almost everything you need to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the leaves are doing this, it means one
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the leaves are doing this, it means
another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the leaves are going like this,
it definitely means another fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're this color, it means one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're this color, it means the other
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're forgetting that as humans,
we've got a lot of powerful senses and we
[SPEAKER_00]: should use those senses first to identify
what's going on with our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the best cannabis I ever smoked
was grown by people that did not have
[SPEAKER_00]: fancy meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most high tech piece of shit that
those people had was probably maybe a pH
[SPEAKER_00]: meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even think they had a timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there was unplugging shit and
plugging it back in at the right time
[SPEAKER_00]: every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the best herb I smoked came from a
very low tech room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have nothing against you guys that have
all the great gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love all the great gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it when I'm in a commercial grow
and I'm in a meeting talking to management
[SPEAKER_00]: and something dings and I look at my phone
and it says, oh, the CO2 ran out in room
[SPEAKER_00]: B.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to go replace the CO2 and like,
how do you know that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, there's a sensor hanging
in the middle of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not detecting any CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in an alert to my phone and now I
know to go replenish the CO2 in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The meters are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like our friend is worried about the
runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows the pH and the EC of the runoff
of what he's feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But did the plants tell you there's
anything wrong with them?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the main point of my ramble here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look back at the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get away from the computers,
the monitors, the buzzers, the devices and
[SPEAKER_00]: the gadgets and let's get familiar with
identifying problems and correcting things
[SPEAKER_00]: by looking at the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess what I'm trying to say is grow
from your heart a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at the plants first and see if
we can figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's use the computers, the books,
the devices, the internet, the web pages
[SPEAKER_00]: to help us out as a hint, as a
confirmation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's go to the plant first,
maybe pull out a grow book, then go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's start looking at all the
devices and seeing what we can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's kind of build a story, not just
ignoring the plants and looking at all the
[SPEAKER_00]: screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more screens, the merrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: My office is filled with screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't get enough of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes the plants are telling you
everything that they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my main answer to this question is if
the plants don't look like they have a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem, why are you worried about the
runoff?
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is a problem, message me back,
send me pictures of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also send me details about the pH that
went in and the pH that came out for the
[SPEAKER_00]: last two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can, send me details about the
EC and what went into those plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just the pH for the past two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will review that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we will do more review and see if we
could help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they look good, if it ain't broke,
don't fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think the bottom line is
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to hearing back from
you if there are any issues with those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, ladies and gentlemen,
boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: foes, smokers, growers, clone cutters,
pollen chuckers, all of you beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis enthusiasts out there,
I do want to thank you once again for
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to another episode of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a good time recording this show.
