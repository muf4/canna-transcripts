[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, welcome to the show, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 375 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by the
Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds, I highly recommend
the Hella Dank Seed Company and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: find them at www.dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start the podcast off by letting
you know what I am smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of the pre-98
Bubba Kush high cannabinoid full spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: extract from our friends at Apothecary
Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label says it is 86% THC and 98.8%
total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is not a lot of aroma coming out of
this jar, but the concentrate in the jar
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like just little chunks of gold
diamonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like I've got gold flakes in a
jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high that comes from this is super
mellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes your shoulders nice and relaxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes your head go kind of numb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feels really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you just relieve pressure in
your body when you take dabs of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot of flavor, but so much potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the pre-98 Bubba Kush high
cannabinoid full spectrum extract from
[SPEAKER_00]: Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked that up at their new Pueblo
location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may be a short episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a Thursday episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been delivering two episodes per week
for quite a while now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This week has been a little overwhelming
with some work stuff, with a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: travel, and I've got a family member who
is sick, which is bringing more family
[SPEAKER_00]: into town.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a little loaded up this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this episode is going to be short so
that I can focus on a solid Monday
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If everything goes according to plan,
the Monday episode will be the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenohunting episode, which will include a
talk about sexing your plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we will also talk a little bit more
about mother plants in that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have a family emergency pop up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, we're going to have to adjust on
the fly, but I'm getting very good at
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to hope that everything works
out properly, and I'll be back Monday with
[SPEAKER_00]: a full length podcast about phenohunting,
about sexing, and about mothering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to be it for this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I boogie down to Albuquerque,
and I met up with a good friend of mine
[SPEAKER_00]: who I'm not sure if he wants all of his
identity revealed here on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: He met me at the hotel that he had set up
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He arrived to the hotel with concentrates,
with the dab rig, with the fresh banger,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the torch, with the carb cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had everything I needed to be able to
properly medicate myself for my adventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was great to land at the hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could take off my shoes and take some
dabs immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a very warm welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, hey dude, thanks for the great
hospitality over the entire adventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just the start of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we hung out in the hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few of my New Mexico friends came
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may have taken a few dabs in the hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may have not taken a bunch of dabs in
the hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after we were properly medicated,
we headed to dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few of us went and had dinner at a nice
little spot there in Albuquerque.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after that, we gathered up and headed
to the Chronicle Bud Bowl at a place
[SPEAKER_00]: called Noah's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Noah's appeared to be a pretty classy
little joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the setup of that place.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you walked in, it was kind of like a
little banquet hall sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was wide open, but then they had tables
and chairs set up to where you could sit
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of restaurant style.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the tables had candles and other
inviting decorative items on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a DJ playing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, the DJ was a little bit too
loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might be getting old, but I couldn't
hear my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking to all of my friends from
New Mexico and when the music is just
[SPEAKER_00]: overwhelmingly loud, it's hard to
communicate with your friends and with
[SPEAKER_00]: your new friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just end up cutting the
conversation short and walking away
[SPEAKER_00]: because you don't want to compete with
that DJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, it was a great
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was set up very beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked the lighting in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked the environment of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a really nice atmosphere in the
building.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just liked the whole setup and the vibe
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The room I hung out in was mostly like the
banquet room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was also where they had the tables with
the entries lined up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about that in just a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there were several other rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was another room where they had a
ping pong table and a big screen TV kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of had more like a college kind of vibe
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a couple of other rooms,
but it was all one big loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could just walk through the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like separate rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just like separate areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't sectioned off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really cool, stylish place.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever get a chance to go to an event
at Noah's, I would go check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do not expect to be able to consume
any type of cannabis in Noah's.
[SPEAKER_00]: They frown upon consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did take some dabs and we were promptly
told to take that shit outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think you can dab in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get yourself yelled at.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were, however, told that we were
welcome to dab outside or smoke outside,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we totally took advantage of that
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to everybody who kept me
medicated all weekend long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I drove from Colorado down to New
Mexico, I opted not to take anything with
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm coming across state lines with
Colorado plates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a white guy with dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to want to see what's in my
car.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I honestly didn't see any law
enforcement until I got into Albuquerque.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a nice rec somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between Santa Fe and Albuquerque on I-25,
that was the first law enforcement that I
[SPEAKER_00]: saw on the entire trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, I'm glad I didn't take
anything with me because if I did,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure I would have gotten pulled over
as soon as I got into New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the way it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to show up to all of these events
empty handed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I show up with plenty of dabs,
with my own rig, with my own torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to follow my friends around and wait
to be offered dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I never needed a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never got to that point where I was
like, huh, I could go for a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kept me well dabbed the entire time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big thanks to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to try to shout anybody out
right now because I will miss somebody and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I will feel bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a minute ago I mentioned they had some
tables with all of the entries on display.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciated being able to see all
of the entries lined up in jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all numbered and labeled so we
could look at them and make notes if we
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had three or four long dining tables
lined up and on each of those tables they
[SPEAKER_00]: would have a label if this was Indica,
if it was Sativa, if it was hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they had a CBD section.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also had what was called the PPL,
which I realized is the private grower
[SPEAKER_00]: entries.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other ones were all from what are
called producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In New Mexico, the dispensary grows are
called producers and the home grows were
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled as PPL.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what PPL stands for exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet one of my New Mexico friends will
send me a message as soon as they hear
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had the tables all set up and then
you would just go look at the jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a bunch of jars on the table and
every jar was numbered, one through
[SPEAKER_00]: however many there were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the tables had approximately 30
jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were approximately 30 Sativa
entries.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were approximately 30 Indica and
approximately 30 hybrid entries.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were not as many CBD entries,
but there were plenty to look through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were also quite a few PPL
entries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would guess there were about 120 total
samples for me to open the jar and give a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice smell to and try to take notes on and
remember what I enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I just randomly started at the
hybrid table because that's where I was
[SPEAKER_00]: standing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what I remember from the
hybrid table was a Stardog entry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the one that stood out to me the
most on the hybrid table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I moved on to the Indica table.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entry that stood out the most to me on
the Indica table was number 25,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I later learned was a Hellfire OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not think that is my Hellfire OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is a cross from somebody
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize that name was already
taken when I named that strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my Hellfire OG is now discontinued.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't make it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody else already has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need for me to cause any sort
of confusion over strain names.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being a Sativa head, I tried to save
that Sativa table for last because I knew
[SPEAKER_00]: that was going to be my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to spoil myself and save the best
for last.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also knew that there were some people
who had entered Arise in that category.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to be honest, one of the jars
that I opened, I knew almost immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: that was my Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a very golden goat dominant
phenotype of my Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That cut is a champion.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have got a great phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no doubt in my mind as soon as I
cracked open that jar and the aroma hit
[SPEAKER_00]: me, I said, oh, that's Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I looked at it and I saw the bud
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, oh, that's a golden goat dominant
phenotype of Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the appearance of that one bud,
I felt like that was the best Sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: entry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying not to be biased.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also smelled a Sour Tangy entry in the
Sativa category that smelled phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Sour Tangy gave the Arise a really
good run for its money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, it was time to give out the
awards.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a bud bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a bud competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was time to give out some awards.
[SPEAKER_00]: The awards were some of the heaviest
trophies I have ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God, you can't tell when I'm holding
the trophy in the picture, but that trophy
[SPEAKER_00]: was super heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk more about that here
in just a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: The award ceremony was a little different
than any other cannabis cup award ceremony
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been to.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most cases, they will say, okay,
first, second, and third for hybrid,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they would announce third place.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would say, the winner for third place
in hybrid is whatever, I'm trying to pick
[SPEAKER_00]: a hybrid strain, Grateful Dog,
and then Grown By Whoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd say, Grateful Dog, Grown By Irene
Genetics, and then I would go up there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and everybody would know that my Grateful
Dog and me just won that award.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that they were doing it at this
event, the guy just said, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: the hybrid category, third place winner,
was this person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know what the strain was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know what their entry was,
and I had to actually yell, what strain
[SPEAKER_00]: was it, so that I could find out what they
had entered and what they had won with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that they cared what the
genetics were or what the entry was,
[SPEAKER_00]: as long as everybody knew that specific
dispensary had just won an award.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only point I think they were
trying to get across.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's common in the cannabis culture when
an award is given that you list the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics that won, so you could say,
this strain won, it was grown by this
[SPEAKER_00]: person, and then you kind of list the
dispensary where it may be available.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all kind of a team, a cohesive
effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this place, they only cared about the
dispensary getting some notoriety,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't there to receive anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that any of my strains were
going to win any awards, but let's jump
[SPEAKER_00]: into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really glad that I yelled,
what strain was that, because Arise won
[SPEAKER_00]: two awards at the Albuquerque Chronicle
Bud Bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, Arise, which is Golden Goat
crossed to Daybreaker, won first place for
[SPEAKER_00]: best hybrid and also third place for best
sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you may say, how did one strain win
two categories?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is honestly a sativa dominant hybrid,
so I can see how it would be entered into
[SPEAKER_00]: the sativa category, and I said the word
hybrid, so it is absolutely a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can qualify for two categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to give a huge shout out to my
new friend Darren from Everest Apothecary
[SPEAKER_00]: in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Darren and I had never met before,
so it was an honor and a pleasure to meet
[SPEAKER_00]: him and shake his hand and congratulate
him for his win with the genetics that I
[SPEAKER_00]: bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't even know I bred it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, hey bro, what strain was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I looked at him, I go, bro,
I bred that, and his eyes lit up like
[SPEAKER_00]: what?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we stood up and talked to each
other for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was bromance at first sight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big congratulations to Darren.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, thanks for the great work with my
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you guys check out my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I posted a picture of Darren and myself
holding those heavy ass trophies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying not to look like they're
heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the heaviest trophies ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That glass part at the top, that is all
filled in with glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those aren't hollow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are filled with glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't pour anything in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall, I think it was a great event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if one of my strains did not win two
awards, I still would have had a great
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The awards were just a bonus, just icing
on the cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was surrounded by good friends and great
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a lot of new friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to meet a lot of the people that
follow me on social media and I got to
[SPEAKER_00]: meet a lot of the prominent members of the
New Mexico cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really an honor to be welcomed
so kindly and so warmly by everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody in New Mexico was excited to see
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all super kind and super polite.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a great little cannabis
community down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'll be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to coming back and hanging
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few people that I didn't get
to get my selfie with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I come back, line up, we're taking
some pictures, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was day one of my adventure in
Albuquerque.
[SPEAKER_00]: I headed back to the hotel, maybe took a
bunch more dabs in the hotel, maybe got
[SPEAKER_00]: some rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next day, I got to visit the
Organica grow facility and the Organica
[SPEAKER_00]: store as a visitor in Albuquerque,
New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to go take a little tour,
got to go check out the grow, got to go
[SPEAKER_00]: see all the growers and all of the iry
genetics plants in the Organica garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really great to walk through and
they're like, yeah, there's a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the cream, that's scarlet begonias.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a lot of great iry stuff in
their garden and it looks really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always great to walk through a grow
and see your genetics just kicking ass
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the whole grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a really great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually got to put on some gloves and
play in the Organica garden for a few
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes, which was really a really good
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoyed getting in there with
those youngsters and having a little grow
[SPEAKER_00]: session with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a bunch of shout outs to
all of my New Mexico crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: A huge, huge shout out to Tim.
[SPEAKER_00]: A extra huge shout out to Amy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, shout outs to both of the
Davids.
[SPEAKER_00]: A huge shout out to Canna Grandma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I finally got my picture with Canna
Grandma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, that means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big shout out to Miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, Miles, you're killing it,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge get well shout out
to my buddy Pryor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey bro, get well, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks like it hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a big shout out to Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big, huge hug and a shout out to my
buddy Huggy Douggy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also not part of Organica, but still a
part of my New Mexico family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Ashley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Cassandra.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also a big old one of those where you
do a handshake and you pull the guy in and
[SPEAKER_00]: you just pat him on the shoulder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do like a thug hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big old thug hug to my boy Deez.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up, dog?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also while I'm giving out shout outs,
I cannot forget my buddy Brad Wines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brad, dude, it was so much fun hanging out
with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just trying to find a good spot to put you
in here and make sure that your shout out
[SPEAKER_00]: stands out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, Brad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brad and I have been friends for quite a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haven't seen him in far too long,
so it's good to go take some New Mexico
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs with Brad on his turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's always here in Colorado, so it's fun
to finally dab out on your turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I want to give a shout out to Wendy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great meeting you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a shout out to Erica.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great finally meeting you face to
face.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a big shout out to Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw that you had a little car crash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're doing well, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of people in New Mexico
that I wish I could include on this list
[SPEAKER_00]: of shout outs, but it is starting to feel
like some sort of weird award show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to everybody in New
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys treated me like royalty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You made me feel like family.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to have a lot of fun in New
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look forward to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really humbling and enlightening to
go to a place where, first of all,
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not allowed to have cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot be in possession of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels really weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go to the store and buy cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can have my products with me as long as
they are properly packaged and carried
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can have all my products, my medicine
and the equipment that I need to use that
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can have my dab rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can have my pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can have a torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can have a dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can have a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can have everything necessary to
administer my medicine properly as long as
[SPEAKER_00]: I carry it in a legal fashion and I am in
the state of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: In New Mexico, that's not an option for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a New Mexico resident.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have recreational cannabis
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminded me to kind of think about how
people feel in non-legal states.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm giving advice and when I'm
talking about cannabis and I talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: how spoiled I am, it kind of reminded me
how you folks feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to watch your back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people in New Mexico were giving
me gifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was politely accepting those gifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I later realized all this shit in my
backpack is completely illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not allowed to have this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really a strange feeling to realize
I am committing a crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am fully illegal just because I crossed
a little invisible line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much respect to all you folks out there in
the illegal states, the non-legal states.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a little glimpse of what that's like
again and it's a shitty feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was also humbling and enlightening to
see New Mexico at the infancy of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been a part of the legalization
movement in Colorado since around
[SPEAKER_00]: 2007-ish, I can say confidently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing other things kind of black
market-wise and shit before that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I didn't get into the legal cannabis
market until 2007 or 2008 when a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and myself were involved in the
very first dispensary in the city of
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were quickly shut down due to illegal
legal reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were still part of the very first
dispensary here and that was 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a 10-year head start on the
cannabis industry and when I go to New
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico, they're very new and it was really
neat to see how they are starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminded me of where our roots were and
the potential of what they have got in
[SPEAKER_00]: those buildings and in their stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really can't wait to go do more work
with all of my New Mexico friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very humbling reminder of my
roots and a reminder of where I started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where this game began and how far this
game can go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where those people in those buildings,
they don't realize that they are
[SPEAKER_00]: revolutionaries in their state right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're starting something serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the next five, seven and 10 years,
they're going to be prominent members of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really fun to look at people that
don't realize that that's who they are
[SPEAKER_00]: becoming and watch them develop into those
positions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw some great young talent while I was
down there in New Mexico and I cannot wait
[SPEAKER_00]: to see what those youngsters make of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that really stood out to me
in New Mexico is that there was no legal
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were at a cannabis event and we were
frowned upon for trying to smoke dabs
[SPEAKER_00]: inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rules are rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're going to invite us to a cup
event where there is cannabis to be
[SPEAKER_00]: judged, let me smoke some cannabis in that
building.
[SPEAKER_00]: That brings me to one of my most popular
rants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were working on legalization
efforts in your area, be sure to include
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of safe consumption sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need somewhere to smoke all of this
cannabis we are buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that come to Colorado from other
states do not have a safe place to consume
[SPEAKER_00]: their cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are very limited places for people
to consume cannabis safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of those places are very hard to
find.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not advertised.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of word of mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very hush hush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Colorado is happy to take your tax
money and take your purchase money for a
[SPEAKER_00]: fat sack of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can't smoke it anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want you smoking in the hotels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't smoke in state parks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't smoke in your car.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you came from out of town and you
bought some cannabis, you basically have
[SPEAKER_00]: to break the rules to consume that
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only safe option that we have thought
of is smoking in an Airbnb and your Airbnb
[SPEAKER_00]: host can ban you from consuming cannabis
there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to make a long rant short, when you
were developing the rules for recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: adult use cannabis in your area,
please consider making rules about
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere to safely congregate and consume
your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we really need somewhere for
cannabis consumers to safely congregate
[SPEAKER_00]: and consume cannabis in a social setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like we do with alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have figured out how to congregate and
consume alcohol in a mostly responsible,
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly adult manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are tons of shitheads when it comes
to alcohol, but for the most part,
[SPEAKER_00]: we do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people at the bar right now
drinking and they're going to make it home
[SPEAKER_00]: safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why can't we do this with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I need to convince any of
you of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we are all on the same page.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those of you who are out there doing
the political fight, please work to
[SPEAKER_00]: include some sort of consumption rules
when you are making the rules for your
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to be able to walk down the
street and hit my dab rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like somewhere I can go and meet
my friends and we can take some dabs
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't it be cool if I could text you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say if I could call you,
but that made me feel old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't it be cool if I could text you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, hey bro, I'm going to go over
to Apothecary and pick up some banana OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll meet you over at the 710 club.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you said, man, you're going to
get the banana OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get the pre-98 Bubba Kush and
I'll meet you over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we both hit the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go over to the dab club and we just
hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take a couple of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to taste your pre-98 Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to taste my Bubba Banana OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot what strains I created for this
scenario, but we get to share
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get to hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably this place is going to be smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to sell some kind of
snacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, just some advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really random.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to sell snacks to stoners
who are politely congregating in your
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke lounge or your dab club,
stop pumping them full of crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Offer them some healthy, wholesome snacks
at a premium price and they will pay for
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not want to buy a can of Coke and a
bag of chips when I'm dabbing to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain my health.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather pay a few extra bucks for
some sort of organic yumminess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some sort of delicious drink when I'm
lit up than some sugary crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to start some sort of a
place where you can consume and serve not
[SPEAKER_00]: super expensive snacks, but some kind of
just not chips and sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some people do, but you would be
doing more of a service to the community
[SPEAKER_00]: if you offered something a little more
healthy and a better option.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you may encourage some of these
stoners to feed themselves a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would be more likely to buy some
stuff that wasn't just movie theater kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get my high ass back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: My point is when you're writing the rules,
please include some sort of consumption
[SPEAKER_00]: area because that's what we're lacking
here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they're lacking in New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't lack that in your cool new
legalization movements.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to wrap up this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody in New Mexico
again for the hospitality.

[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for hanging out with me for a
random episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I know there was not a lot of
grow talk in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I do have a very ill family member,
so I'm a little more focused on him right
[SPEAKER_00]: now than a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to knock out a quick Thursday
episode so I can focus on the Monday
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I can chill out and kind of worry
about my family a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If everything goes well, I'll be back
Monday with the grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about phenol hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about finding a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that process, we are going to be
sexing our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all one big project that happens all
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be a great grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really look forward to getting that out
to you Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everybody has a good, safe weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to meeting with you in just
a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to Miles
Turner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're killing it, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mama a hug for me.
Thank you.
Thank you.
