[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to send you a special Patreon

[SPEAKER_00]: You may have noticed on social media I did
buy a new microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it the mic mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's over there on the production setup
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what that table is called.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the official name.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a new microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a cloud lifter.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a mic stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a set of headphones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got mic all set up ready to record
episode 719.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was contributed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was supported.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was funded by the great folks from
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people ask where that money goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens to it?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys bought mic a mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for the mic mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also big shout out to white mic for
joining me for episode 719.
[SPEAKER_00]: He should be here in just a couple of
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a great show planned for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really thank you guys for the Patreon
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Patreon support does help fund things
like the mic mic the cloud lifter one time
[SPEAKER_00]: the cloud lifter that's what powers this
microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microphone runs to a thing that gives
it juice and then that runs to a recording
[SPEAKER_00]: device.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon paid for the microphone the mic
arm the cords the power the recording
[SPEAKER_00]: device the editing computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the stuff that the Patreon pays
for also pays for the website pays for the
[SPEAKER_00]: web service here so that we can post the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Businessy things come out of the Patreon
account to keep it keep it a legit
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys that's what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my report for the fiscal year
2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why I wanted you to know what
we do with the Patreon money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to thank you and let you know
what I do with the funding that you
[SPEAKER_00]: provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to put it back into the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some sort of way if I need equipment
there is some stuff in an account that if
[SPEAKER_00]: shit goes wrong I can buy maybe an iPad a
computer a microphone whatever breaks a
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know that camera 2 can kiss my
ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may replace that eventually but there
may be another camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what happens with the Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm high and rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the main point here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send another thank you to all of
the people who warned me that a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: the audio episodes were not posting and
populating on the audio server feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am posting it the way that I'm supposed
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did what I am required supposed to
knowledgeable of doing and for some reason
[SPEAKER_00]: the feeds just were not catching the files
that I was posting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the audio services didn't have 7
14 15 and possibly 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: That issue has been corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those episodes are now to the best
of my knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those episodes are now on Apple podcast
Spotify stitcher radio pod bean all that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot get Google to update.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you guys are watching listening
waiting for the show on Google podcast I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't get it to update.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why I've messaged them
contact customer service.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's always going to suck and be slow
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also somebody asked why there's only so
many episodes on Spotify.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not up to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get to decide that Spotify decides
how much space they're going to dedicate
[SPEAKER_00]: to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys like Joe Rogan they get an unlimited
fucking feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put it all up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: People with smaller audiences smaller
viewerships less numbers less clicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get less room.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't think you want to listen to
more than 100 of episodes of my nonsense
[SPEAKER_00]: yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they only give me server space
bandwidth space storage space for my most
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 recent episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not up to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a Spotify issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe Apple podcast hosts like 300
of my shows maybe more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't go check that the listeners tell
me this sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you are upset frustrated
complaining bent vexed in some way that
[SPEAKER_00]: older episodes have disappeared from
Spotify.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nothing I can control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So until we get more listens more
viewership then they will add our library
[SPEAKER_00]: will be much longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But until then that's just what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the meantime you can check out all of
the episodes on the YouTube channel every
[SPEAKER_00]: episode up till from like episode 20 I
think all the way up should be on the
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube server and the older episodes are
on the old channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow culture which has been defunct and
that I think I share them somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to find everything on
the grow from your heart podcast YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: it should all be there check it out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also click like and subscribe because
that's where the numbers count the most
[SPEAKER_00]: for me when I'm doing advertising and
promotion and sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: People want to see the YouTube numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the main point here was thank you to
everybody that lets me know that sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: the shows aren't populating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know because I don't watch the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't listen to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do make sure that YouTube comes up the
other servers I can't check on as
[SPEAKER_00]: regularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do rely on you and I do thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm grateful for the teamwork that you
guys do provide me for letting me know
[SPEAKER_00]: that my show did not populate on some
servers.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have more notes to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am almost ready for more testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm opening the fucking floodgates
for my email inbox here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got more seeds coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made more seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're making more seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have more seeds in progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say we because I talk about I make and
touch every single seed that comes from I
[SPEAKER_00]: read genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have some helpers now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I needed more space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using spaces to make more seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will work out for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all Rasta Jeff touched.
[SPEAKER_00]: Approved and done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we needed more spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're expanding the team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality control will be everything it has
been.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I need more testers to
maintain quality control.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me find that before I even go any
further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell you which episode it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a grow from your heart podcast
tester episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm typing in that right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to be a tester,
the first step to test seeds for I read
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, the prerequisite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't qualify until you do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You must watch and pay close attention to
episode five hundred and ninety of the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That episode is all about becoming a seed
tester for my brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to test for me, that is the
very first step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out episode five ninety of this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's here on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will help you a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you watch that, you'll be given some
hints and tips and you'll know more what
[SPEAKER_00]: to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing I will require you to do is
to join my discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would really like to have all of the
testers on discord in the discord tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That helps me out tremendously when
looking for test reports, for info,
[SPEAKER_00]: for details, for photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go to one place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really makes it easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So watch the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join my discord post in the tester tab
that you have watched the videos that lets
[SPEAKER_00]: me know you're paying attention and
following instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are more steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will get those steps when you follow
these proper instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I make you follow instructions
is because I'm not giving out free seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: to give out free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I expect things in return for the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need detailed reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't follow a few instructions to
get these seeds, I can't fuck with you to
[SPEAKER_00]: give you free seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of work to get you some beans
to show you qualify to be on the team is
[SPEAKER_00]: all this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So listen to the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join the discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send the correct email the way it's been
asked for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then wait for a reply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do not feel like I have ignored
you, blown you off this time, discredited
[SPEAKER_00]: you if I do not reply promptly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am only looking for a certain amount of
testers at this time and I'm going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: an overwhelming amount of responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't reply to you, if I don't send
you a message, just wait because this is
[SPEAKER_00]: one phase of testing that is going to
happen this year and I will do many,
[SPEAKER_00]: many phases of testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't fuck with you this time and you
send me a bunch of messages saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: why didn't you pick me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why didn't you pick me?
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't pick you next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're cool about it, I may pick you
next time randomly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be two months.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may just say, oh, listener number seven
thousand five hundred and four sent an
[SPEAKER_00]: email and they want to be a tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like their app.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at the top of the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't qualify the last two phases
because I had my number.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reach a number of testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I send them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wait for reports to start coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I'm satisfied, I send more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of just phases timing when I've
got timing when I need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be at the top of the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be on the next phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll send you a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send a bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ready to be a tester?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have room?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is your chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do not get discouraged if I don't reach
out to let you test right the fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it may be in the near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be at the top of the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may be waiting for you for a specific
reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I know that you do a certain thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I know you don't do a certain thing
and I need that coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't blow your slot by blowing me up with
too many negative emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand we all get impatient.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all get eager.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Packaging the tester seeds, selecting the
testers, reading the email applications,
[SPEAKER_00]: loading up the beans into packages,
putting them in shipping, checking the
[SPEAKER_00]: test reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love each and every one of you,
but we've got to work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I said this is not the only phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may randomly select you next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of regular seeds out there
being tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're following the discord
tester group, you know that I've got three
[SPEAKER_00]: testers out there right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That people finally kind of know what
they've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I revealed what they've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I waited a long time to tell people
there's a Bubba Kush to arise that has
[SPEAKER_00]: been in testing and is going to pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will be released.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have decided the name of that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is, um, arise F one number four
cross to Jack the ripper that will pass
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I approve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a name for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys will love the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you the names of that in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was another one that people
can't figure out quite what the cross is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that one is going to pass testing also
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far it looks like, uh, but there's a
lot of regular seeds and testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got new regular seeds coming
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that will be released.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll announce the names of the things I
just told you about pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am personally making more of the older
stuff that needs restocks, the golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goats, the lemon Jefferies, the orange
gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making more of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also making more blue pill and red pill
for official release.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also more stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be, do I tell you that I put
Chernobyl in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the room to get pollinated by a
reversed golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I tell you that I did that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we talk about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, we're going to move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll not tell you the name idea that I
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to be tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'm making new FEMS and another
location that you guys don't even know
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Paul and we have reversed a plant
and we have pollinated the gorilla glue
[SPEAKER_00]: for the chem for possibly blue raspberry
truffle, quite a few things with a
[SPEAKER_00]: reversal to make some great FEMS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will need testing very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're being harvested now, uh,
being packaged up as soon as they're
[SPEAKER_00]: ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get them out for testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of great shit coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of testing and restocking to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be discouraged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't send too many hate mails.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't get selected to be a tester
right now, there are more phases coming,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of opportunity this year to be a
tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're already a tester and you'd like
to test again, if you've done what you
[SPEAKER_00]: consider to successful test run,
reach out on the discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now's a good time to get yourself in line.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've already done testing and you've
got a recommendation for another tester,
[SPEAKER_00]: send me that recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they have applied and you recommended
them and you're already on the team,
[SPEAKER_00]: that does help you out, but be careful
with your recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't taint your reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said taint.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's keep moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking about testing for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was not meant to be a testing
episode, but here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to remind you about the groovy
gravy secret stash seed event coming up in
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got all of the details right here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me pull that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not prepare and put that on my
screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I magically remember the date because of
technology, March 26th in Denver,
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: The groovy gravy secret stash seed event
will be happening once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics, premium seeds,
and many other of your favorite top seed
[SPEAKER_00]: makers will be there slanging the beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come grab some seeds, possibly get some
t-shirts, get a hug, get a high five,
[SPEAKER_00]: take a selfie with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: White Mike should be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If things work out, who knows who else I
might bring.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be there high five and given hugs,
given kisses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not think it is a
consumption-friendly event, so I will not
[SPEAKER_00]: be given dabs, but show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will have soca souffle, the machine,
blue raspberry truffle, lady marmalade,
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry starburst, sun kiss,
and possibly some of these new fems that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been teasing you about to share.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come join the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't miss it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out groovy gravy on Instagram for
more information and just follow me on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be posting more stuff about the
groovy gravy event very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking to see where I can lead you,
but so far I think groovy gravy is the way
[SPEAKER_00]: to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't miss the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys look forward to being there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look forward to seeing you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year was a huge success.
[SPEAKER_00]: You saw the photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: They missed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be mad at yourself for missing it
this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that covers all of the business
and rambles here at the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that was a long time, but we got a
lot of ground covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about some of these emails that
I have received recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: My inboxes have been blowing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do not stop sending me messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before, it's just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I don't reply right away,
I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: But occasionally I'll stay up super late
and just answer a bunch of emails and get
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of shit done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may reply to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get upset.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate the messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that grow help tab on the
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get down to business.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a couple of emails here in front
of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from a Nana mouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a name on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: No signature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, yo Rasta Jeff, just wanted
to let you know, I've been watching since
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit before episode 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, welcome to the party, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I just want to say, man,
I really have been enjoying the shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a longtime smoker, never grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm debating on whether I should do it in
my apartment or wait till I get a house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say wait till you get the house,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait till you get a house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but in the meantime, I'm loving
watching your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're very entertaining and funny as
fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's not a comedy show, but I do feel
like I hate learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I, I love learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hated school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate being bombarded with information
that makes my brain frazzled and confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in school, I didn't care about half
the shit they were teaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love these kinds of lessons,
but it makes your brain work better.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a joke and some laughter in the
middle, it's like a treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like training a dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I run you through the obstacle course,
make you sit, stay, lay down, roll over,
[SPEAKER_00]: jump over this thing, crawl under this
thing, give you a treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't ever give you the treat,
just fucking abusing you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like a little laughter,
a little fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a treat for your brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody works better with a smile on
their face.
[SPEAKER_00]: A joke will make everybody smile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I'm glad you're digging the,
the jokes, the funny part of the vibe
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I do have a comedian spirit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comedy is one of my favorite things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to go to comedy shows and see
comedy comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, best thing on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the, now one of the best things on
the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comedy laughter is medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, funny as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife doesn't even smoke, but she
watches with me because you're fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the great work, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't wait to get some seeds from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love, bro, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your wife, uh, Mrs. Bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dude, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you guys are loving the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you guys are watching together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannot wait for you to get that new house
together, get growing, get shit going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys can both listen to the show
and then get in the garden together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it a bonding experience with,
uh, do you say wife or girlfriend?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wife, make it a bonding experience with
the wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can bring your girlfriend too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your wife allows you, Hey, don't slap
him for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but make it a bonding experience in
the grow space there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, he's going to grow your medicine
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you grow some his and hers meds,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I challenge you to let her grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of plants that you don't fuck
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you grow a couple that she don't fuck
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bet you she'll be a better grower
than you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the women have a special touch when
it comes to the ganja plants to all
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, dude, they just, they're magical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let the wife get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get that grow going and bro,
thank you for the great compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you find me entertaining and
funny as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also love it that the wife is listening
and watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love knowing people are doing shit
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big vibes, big love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep watching you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get that grow going, I look
forward to all of your cultivations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis culture questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't sign it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no name here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my new anonymous
couple friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is from our buddy Terp Gooney.
[SPEAKER_00]: We gave Terp Gooney a shout out on the
last episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bad motherfucker has an iry army
tattoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got the cross with iry army above it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's cooler than me right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sent a compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says your pendant on the seven 12
episode is fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is straight fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move the microphone out of
the way, kind of show you the pendant for
[SPEAKER_00]: a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll get right back to the podcast,
but I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: This pendant is straight fucking fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may just drop in a photo of it because
moving the mic might not do a lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: but here's what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a number of pastel like colors and
what looks to be like a bloom type of a
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, possibly a Lotus might've been
what they were going for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just realized that as I'm looking at it
at this angle with an Ohm sign in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Ohm right in the middle of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw this at a glass shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually saw two of them and I thought,
I know somebody that would love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get us those matching
pendants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a big shout out to the person who
has the other pendant that looks just like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: She knows who she is.
[SPEAKER_00]: She doesn't want the shout out on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's kind of shy, but had to grab the
pending.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is another person out there rocking
a match to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's super awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: This came from our friend glass by Blake
on Instagram, check out glass underscore
[SPEAKER_00]: by underscore Blake on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: He makes a lot of great shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more stuff I'm going to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a Murakami Pindi that I've really
got my eye on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he may have sold it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be a blessing in disguise or a
blessing in the skies, depending on who
[SPEAKER_00]: you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but big shout out to Blake wind guard
glass glass by Blake for the Pindi and big
[SPEAKER_00]: thanks to my buddy Terp Gooney for
noticing the dope pendant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also shout out to positively vibes in
Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I picked it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great folks there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The owner is super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: The staff is super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heady glass kicking ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why I even said that,
but the place is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did I get my notes mixed up?
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys saw it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend Andrew and
Andrew says, what's up Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently finished my first run of
producing seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that a fun, exciting project?
[SPEAKER_00]: Except this ends in tragedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a tragedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will warn you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says it was dark hollow or it was a fun
and unexpected unexpected project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I jumped ahead of line while I
was popping a bag of dark hollow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stumbled upon the stinkiest male plant
I've ever smelled.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's going to have some stinky
bitches in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dark hollow male plant was probably a
champ.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says great structure, vigorous and an
intense garlicky funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's hard to describe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it, but I can almost smell it in my
mind because I know that plant so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I happen to have an extra Xanadu
female and some extra space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what's going to happen here,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put them on a date.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I kept them very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he does go on to kind of describe
the grow a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fabric pots, soil, synthetic help,
Mars Hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything seemed to be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very healthy all the way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a ton of very healthy looking seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's where we turn to tragedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tragedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a tragedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you want to say it, this is where
the fucked up part happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the seeds have shells made of
vibranium.
[SPEAKER_00]: After several attempts at every method of
germinating, soaking, scarring,
[SPEAKER_00]: scraping, cracking, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: I finally got two seeds to crack through
the shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was about after 25 attempts.
[SPEAKER_00]: After examining the other failed tries,
it appears that the seed was trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: push the root through, but none of them
were capable of cracking the seed shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that does make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a reason why.
[SPEAKER_00]: And possibly another test or solution you
could try.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I usually have good germination
techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any idea what I may have done to cause
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love your vibe in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be well from my new friend Andrew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Andrew, big love, big respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps possibly an answer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about what I think could have
gone wrong in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you let the seeds go for too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should have been harvested earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: They simply got too thick, too tough,
too strong because they were there too
[SPEAKER_00]: long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen this happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not much you can do now except
next time cut them down earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe go through and find the seeds you
think might really germ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I've seen a thing called the seed
cracker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably do it with a pair of
pliers or whatever else you got,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're going to fuck up some seeds
doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little device that you put a
seed in it and you twist a handle and the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed goes crack and it kind of pops the
shell for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you attempt to germ it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the bottom line, the real answer here
straight up without any bullshit,
[SPEAKER_00]: without buttering it up, without sugar
coating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those seeds grew for too long and
they're all going to be probably
[SPEAKER_00]: problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a silicate issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a feed issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I'm going to say that this was a
timing issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds simply, they went too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got too hard and now they're just too
hard and too tough and too thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what I do think happened to
your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had better advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had info on how to correct that
because you've got a batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many you made.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really say, but you pop 25 of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you must have a nice number.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you make seeds, you guys,
you make a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you probably got a lot to play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bummer that it's not a winner,
but it's cool that it was just kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: side project that you did learn from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take this as a learning lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long did you flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you take notes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you pulling seeds off occasionally
and squeezing them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a way we can correct this in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next time you're making seeds,
start pulling them out of the plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: checking on them a little bit earlier than
you did this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I know that seeds are getting close
or not even close, when I'm getting antsy
[SPEAKER_00]: and anxious and nervous and want more
beans, I'll go to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just pick a nug somewhere on the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just reach in and pull a seed right
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can feel them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't, there are no seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yours were obviously hard enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start pulling a few out, rub the shell
off, put in your hand, squeeze it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it explode?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it pop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it crunch?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it crack?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or does it leave a dent in your fingers?
[SPEAKER_00]: If they start leaving dents in your
fingers, they're close to done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they tiger striped?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they the color you want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they solid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Start paying attention to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can prevent leaving them for too
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you could take the tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds will be ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let the bottoms keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you only let some go too long,
maybe some too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoors, it's kind of hard to judge,
but indoors, you should have pollinated
[SPEAKER_00]: all at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that pollen should hit at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the seeds should be consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to tell by plucking
seeds from two or three spots,
[SPEAKER_00]: examining, do that once or twice,
three or four times, and you'll know how
[SPEAKER_00]: far along those seeds are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, bottom line, my prognosis,
my diagnosis, my hypothesis, my thesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: my fucking stoner idea, my brose science
does say that these seeds simply grew for
[SPEAKER_00]: too long and they got too hard,
too thick, too robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I would try to crack them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would work more on the scarification,
maybe a longer germ soak, maybe soak them
[SPEAKER_00]: for 24 hours, uh, crack them or soak them.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, wait, try that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crack them or scar them, then soak them
for 24, then try to germ them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may help you out, but it sounds like
you've tried a lot of good methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing the right shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the Hulk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're made out of, uh, what'd you say,
Vibra?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uranium unobtainium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're made out of fucking steel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they went for too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that was good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I don't have a real
solution other than, uh, check next time a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be my advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay more attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying you didn't pay attention,
but pay more attention next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you know what to look for,
how to correct it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy, Andrew, uh, thank you for the
great compliments and thank you for the
[SPEAKER_00]: great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you get some keepers out of there
and I hope you find a winner out of those
[SPEAKER_00]: beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls,
pimp, friends, foes, smokers, growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: clone cutters, Paul and Chuckers,
all of you wonderful cannabis enthusiasts
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do want to thank you once again
for listening to another episode of the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was 718 episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blows my mind that you guys want to listen
to that much of my nonsense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the support coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do send more grow questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like answering grow questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lets me know that I am helping you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody has that question,
there are thousands of listeners to this
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one person's got the question,
the numbers tell me there are probably
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple people that have that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are only so many opportunities and
things to do in cannabis growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a question arises, a lot of people
were probably thinking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One person said it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it lets me know that I'm helping you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives me, um, an objective,
a mission, a purpose, how to help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it helps me not have to just come up
with a show off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that helps a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So send in those questions, send the
details, the comments, uh, the motivation
[SPEAKER_00]: questions, the community questions,
all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do look forward to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also check out the website, ire genetics
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also patreon.com forward slash grow from
your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys already know about that because
my throat's burning out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've covered all the content and it's time
to wrap up the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back in a couple of days with
fresh new content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give a big shout out to my buddy and
the captain and commander of the ire army,
[SPEAKER_00]: my good friend, lemur priest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mama a hug for me.
Thanks for watching.
