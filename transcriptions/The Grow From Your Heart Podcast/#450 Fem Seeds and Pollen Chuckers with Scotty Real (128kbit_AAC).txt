good friends lately man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting to know each other a bit
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're definitely kindred spirits So I
agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but we got different skill sets
brothers from other mothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it I love it but way different
skill sets like remember I said I want
[SPEAKER_00]: your nose cuz you Can actually smell
absolutely terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a lot of people tell me that lately
they want my turf nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so I wanted to ask you first off
I did want to start off with breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: because I have a feeling it relates to
Your sensory your sensory perceptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes Yeah, what me first off if I'm just
looking at breeders, what makes a legit
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder?
[SPEAKER_01]: What what makes a legit breeder?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I may frustrate some people here
What they call pollen chuckers there a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of all I call myself a pollen chucker just
cuz I'm I'm humble excuse that I'm a legit
[SPEAKER_01]: reader somebody with a goal somebody that
when you start off breeding you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: goal which not as which is not money right
a goal which is to create a line that is
[SPEAKER_01]: improving something or Maybe you're
growing strain a and strain B and you want
[SPEAKER_01]: the flavor of strain a and the vigor of
strain B, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a goal not just put a bunch of
elite cuts in a room and a mail and
[SPEAKER_01]: sprinkle some pollen and then sell those
seeds Sure, that's a pollen chucker That's
[SPEAKER_01]: an asshole.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's somebody out for profits a breeder
is somebody with a goal Then once those
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds are made you have to test them You
can't just make seeds and put them out and
[SPEAKER_01]: sorry about the throat clearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got dabbed out here By the way,
right as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was asking you about he's got the rig
and the torch and everything I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: come on man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just hit an e now It's so fucking easy and
we all hit a dab in each one of us one dab
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're stoned Yeah, the whole room is a
little lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was nice, but it is different,
you know even smoking out of a pan Or even
[SPEAKER_00]: those little cartridge pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just don't get a stone this way to
just take a fucking full-on torch dad,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I agree That's why I've got that rig
with me almost all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah travel piece and that's cold start is
that we want It's an insert dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it an insert.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard it called a few other things,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I put the dab in a basically a glass
thimble and then heat the banger and then
[SPEAKER_01]: drop the thimble into the banger and cap
it right it works kind of like a double
[SPEAKER_01]: boiler instead of my dab hitting hot glass
it gets to heat up slowly and so I get it
[SPEAKER_01]: as it comes to temperature and Sure
scolding hot dabs directly to the lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like I'm kind of hot but right just come
it bubbles up You can watch the dab bubble
[SPEAKER_01]: and it comes to temperature instead of
just instantly Yeah, I seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can work better you get a lot of
draws off one good dab Yeah, really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it Everybody in the room is baked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got me going So we're just gonna
bullshit a little bit man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good at that since we've declared.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all baked We're just gonna bullshit
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're good at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dude first off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know I read genetics ever since
I've been you know in the DGC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always known you guys existed,
but You guys are when you go pro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna ask who I didn't know we did It
just seemed to kind of I took I just
[SPEAKER_01]: follow the steps that I seem were supposed
to happen in life as a blower as a breeder
[SPEAKER_01]: at all just kept coming to me naturally
and I would see opportunities and some I
[SPEAKER_01]: had to decline and some I knew were right
and One day I was here doing this I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know that this was the exact intention You
can tell what I obviously believe in the
[SPEAKER_01]: colors I wear sure sure that had a lot to
do with it I just listened to the steps
[SPEAKER_01]: from above and followed the path that was
laid in front of me And I think I'm right
[SPEAKER_01]: where I'm supposed to be and the skill
set.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where'd you get the skills?
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of that I think comes from passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love cannabis I've got crazy ADD and
when I smoke that seems to stop there are
[SPEAKER_01]: 7,000 thoughts happening in this crazy
brain of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I smoke I can hear five of them
really clearly it's so advantageous for my
[SPEAKER_01]: life It just makes all that background
chatter stop and then I can function
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I started smoking a lot right and
then I think like most of us I got tired
[SPEAKER_01]: of paying for it So I wanted to grow my
own and then I wasn't satisfied with the
[SPEAKER_01]: clones and the seeds I was getting So I
started making my own stuff and then how
[SPEAKER_01]: long ago is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably before I should admit there
weren't legal cannabis laws when I first
[SPEAKER_01]: got into it But as soon as we were able to
get more rooms and more space I was up and
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding and doing it nice 2008-2009,
before that in other states and you were
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding though You had the foresight to I
was just super psyched to be able to find
[SPEAKER_00]: a cut back in 2008-2009 I was lucky to be
I had some good friends who were ahead of
[SPEAKER_01]: the game I had some friends who came from
California right from North Carolina who
[SPEAKER_01]: were growing out in the hills for years
and years I had friends with Oakster Dam
[SPEAKER_01]: University teachings who brought cuts from
Oakster Dam that I got a hold of So I just
[SPEAKER_01]: fell into the right circles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I was really blessed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I say I just followed the steps
That were laid in front of me right
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever I believe in put me right where I
needed to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's interesting Okay,
so that's how that makes you pro it makes
[SPEAKER_00]: you pro because you've been doing it first
off for so long and then you've got such a
[SPEAKER_00]: good reputation now I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a fact But so what do you say
to all I see all these people I get people
[SPEAKER_00]: handing me packs of seeds all the time and
I don't know what to say I don't know what
[SPEAKER_00]: to think about them and you know,
what do you what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about?
[SPEAKER_00]: When who would call yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you would call yourself professional
if you're a young breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh That's uh, I guess that's up to you Why
when you're when your seeds when you know
[SPEAKER_01]: that everybody growing your seeds is not
having a problem, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big sign people are reporting
hermaphrodites if they're complaining
[SPEAKER_00]: right not professional Yeah, I just see
it's such a trendy business and I see
[SPEAKER_00]: people always trying to just throw
something and throw something out there
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's That's hype.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a instant success.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also you don't see those people around
I've been here for a little while when
[SPEAKER_01]: when I was trying to get on seeds here now
He said one of the things that brought him
[SPEAKER_01]: me to his attention, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been around for a while and he said
I've seen you you haven't been here for
[SPEAKER_01]: just two weeks Sure a lot of these new
pollen chuckers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that that makes a difference those
guys just throw on pollen on hype strains
[SPEAKER_01]: They won't be here for two or three
harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see a bunch of herms come from them
people complain They'll disappear but you
[SPEAKER_00]: do hear I mean there's guys who was the
bubba guy the there's an alien guy rather
[SPEAKER_00]: shoot We just gave away some of these
seeds last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know his name and It's killing me and
it's a it's a funny name.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, we're so he's known for
something specific, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's known for that alien.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so you're known for a rise Is that
what you would say your rise would be my
[SPEAKER_01]: high potency regular line that right not
available in fans Okay line that's popular
[SPEAKER_01]: would be the lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so I've got a regular and a
feminized line a rise in lemon Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Okay, so we're talking first off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get in the feminized a little
bit We'll hold that for one second because
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just thinking about being a breeder
and I'm Actually, I was laughing because
[SPEAKER_00]: it seems like it's a license to print
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, dude You just you know put
pollen on there You come back and you got
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds of seeds and you sell them for
five packs for a hundred bucks or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not like I was talking to James
being our friend James being seeds here
[SPEAKER_00]: now huge supporter You can go get your
seeds over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do yeah, but we're I was talking
about just so many obstacles Just about
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to do business how much
discrimination there is out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you've even a CBD you say the word CBD
You get discriminated on your Facebook
[SPEAKER_01]: shut down your Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it causes problems quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man What would you say man if we're
looking at obstacles obstacles about being
[SPEAKER_00]: in this business some unforeseen things
Your social media is gonna be a struggle a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of people think they're gonna
advertise on social media My social media
[SPEAKER_01]: gets taken away all of my friends social
media if you post pictures of plants if
[SPEAKER_01]: you say the wrong stuff Social media goes
the YouTube channels our friend Colin his
[SPEAKER_01]: video is gone from your feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and what is that someone hater?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's all it takes I think it is all
it takes man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just simple things like that the social
media we take that for granted I come from
[SPEAKER_01]: an era when we didn't really have that
right when I started doing this We weren't
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to be doing this So for me just
to be able to post my pictures feels kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of it feels like it's a special thing So I
feel yeah, I understand when people say
[SPEAKER_00]: they're lurkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like I've been lurking for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was me Yeah, I'm proud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've been disguising my IP address
before Over grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've got my face and my giant buds
That's where you can buy it and we've got
[SPEAKER_01]: it all I love it that I feel like we're
really taking that for granted now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We feel that's really a huge privilege I
didn't have that back when I was starting
[SPEAKER_01]: this obstacles As a seed breeder you
there's a lot of work to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to become relevant You said
people it's a license to print money sure
[SPEAKER_01]: But that money is a lottery or monopoly
money until you've established that your
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds are worth something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's true No offense to you the guys
in this room, but if we made one warehouse
[SPEAKER_01]: Kyle seeds, they're not gonna go anywhere
What if we put his picture on the back
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe if that picture with no shirt?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe but the ladies will buy a few packs
and then it'll stop moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but I understand it is there's a lot
of work a lot of You have to be vetted by
[SPEAKER_01]: the community a lot of people have to grow
it right and if somebody doesn't like you
[SPEAKER_01]: in the cannabis industry or community that
spreads more quickly than a good
[SPEAKER_01]: reputation Oh, you ain't kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a thousand likes and one thumbs
down and everyone goes what's with the
[SPEAKER_01]: thumbs down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why that pisses me off I do that myself
There's a hundred nice comments about
[SPEAKER_00]: something and one person being like,
oh, you know, whatever a negative and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: like Why did he think that I'm sitting
there at the you know, the baseball game
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm like, why did he think that I
wonder?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why doesn't everybody like what I say if
everybody likes you it's fake one person
[SPEAKER_01]: has to not like you yeah something right
because if somebody doesn't like it you're
[SPEAKER_01]: you're pissing someone off and that you
should be If everybody likes it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're fake.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like one of those I tell my
kid a product for everyone is a product
[SPEAKER_00]: for No, yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely dial it in get your target
and if you don't like me, that's okay
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody you do like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely is it absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes All right So getting back to breeding
if I'm because I'm just thinking about how
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked to like a bunch of breeders
and everybody wants to get into the game I
[SPEAKER_00]: was thinking about how long it would just
how long it takes to figure out even if
[SPEAKER_00]: something's working You got you got a
cross that you did a rise by Mac Maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, which seems to be on your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a psychic Did I did I blow it I'm
gonna make myself some arise to max seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and we'll see what happens right now
That's exactly we'll see what we'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long does it take to see what happens?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of investment we've got to veg
but we've got to cut clones You have to
[SPEAKER_01]: cut in a rise male.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to get a Mac clones You're cutting
those you got what 14 days in your cloning
[SPEAKER_01]: machine 10 14 days Then you've got to put
those in small pots You got probably two
[SPEAKER_01]: or three weeks there, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I go into a three gallon pot for four
maybe six weeks there?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're already at about 10 weeks,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: We share water already now I'm gonna
flower about around day 18 to 25 I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinate then I've got another 40 or 50
days before those seeds are done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we harvest Okay plants dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like the half life now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah now I've got seeds now I've got to
grow the seeds to find out if what I've
[SPEAKER_01]: created is worth a shit because it could
be It could be amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be a total dud I don't know
because I've never played with the Mac
[SPEAKER_01]: before sure I know what Solomon does He's
reliable, but I don't know what that Mac
[SPEAKER_01]: girl how she's gonna react to that pollen
and what those genes are gonna do together
[SPEAKER_01]: It could make a bunch of lopsided
handicapped plants for all I know and so I
[SPEAKER_00]: know Okay, and what's the deal you were
talking about reputation earlier?
[SPEAKER_00]: Herms are the worst thing you can do for
your reputation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, if I were to release hermaphrodite
seeds I would destroy all of this that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've built up right stop all of the
everything and done So when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: crossing with things, you don't really
know we're kind of we're just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for the best here the way that I
do my Best to prevent that is to not use
[SPEAKER_01]: hermaphroditic parent plants if that's
what it is plants that you're using have a
[SPEAKER_01]: tendency to herm Do not breed with them
because that will come out down the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, maybe not a whole bunch But it will
show up and if it shows up then it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem that has to happen So I've got to
grow those seeds that I make you write
[SPEAKER_01]: myself or send them out So I've got a lot
of good friends who are reliable testers
[SPEAKER_01]: They get them and they know hey,
this is brand new you try this you take
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures look out for problems Right could
be it could be a ticking time bomb in your
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just pay attention for this It could be
a hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be totally weird or it could be
the new Mac.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know got it Yeah, you have to
give them a warning but they grow that for
[SPEAKER_01]: me or I grow them and then we make sure
then if it's successful then I give it to
[SPEAKER_01]: James Bean sure lets it out as a tester or
as a freebie to other people and then they
[SPEAKER_01]: grow it also and say I got free stuff then
we see that it works well in a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: right and feed back hydro cocoa soilless
organics LEDs Whatever kind of lighting
[SPEAKER_01]: you could think of I want all the results
and then we'll put it out for the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure Yeah, all right that makes sense
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here's one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to I've had this explained to
me before you're you're a good good You're
[SPEAKER_00]: actually a podcaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably explain this to me in a
very simple way Femseeds feminize seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of you know,
the Internet's full of bullshit Oh
[SPEAKER_00]: femseeds will harm on you, you know that
kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you explain feminize seed?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's fairly simple if Like I said
a minute ago if you use hermaphroditic
[SPEAKER_01]: parents you get hermaphroditic offspring
Okay, if the femseeds are made with
[SPEAKER_01]: hermaphroditic girls, they will be
hermaphrodites the way that I make them is
[SPEAKER_01]: I carefully select my girls I stress test
the females that I use so if I'm gonna use
[SPEAKER_01]: a strawberry fields girl and a Golden Goat
will just say cuz I'm popular for using
[SPEAKER_01]: the Golden Goat and reversing it sure I
put those in a room and I'll run them on
[SPEAKER_01]: 1212 like we normally do but about two
weeks in I'll go and change the light
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle I want to see what they do under
stress and if they hermaphrodite they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't get to breed they get taken out of
the breeding schedule they're gone no more
[SPEAKER_01]: readers if they Show me that they're
worthy then I'll work with them and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: where we'll get to the feminized talk So
I'll take the Golden Goat plant and I make
[SPEAKER_01]: a product called silver thiosulphate It's
really easy to figure out how to make that
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't teach a lot about how to make that
I don't want to get too detailed I just
[SPEAKER_01]: want to take that product I spray that
product on the plant right turns the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: It's makes pollen sacks that contain
pollen that only have female chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no male chromosomes in that plant
But I have just tricked that plant or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's the Silver stops the copper
movement which creates other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a blocker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes Look at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get me to understand it brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you step at a time All right,
so we stop the copper movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: We create other hormones from moving then
we create pollen sacks with Female pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: then I put that female pollen on a female
plant now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no opportunity for male It's all
female chromosomes happening right if I
[SPEAKER_01]: have chosen my parents correctly and I'm
quite careful to do it I don't get any
[SPEAKER_01]: reports of hermaphrodites in my seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah That's why you got a good reputation
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why the brothers and there are a
lot of them out there now a lot of lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: jeffries a lot of gold, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're out right and first off.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I guess you have have you ever had
it cuz I mean, what the hell do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like a fire erupting right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Chop them down, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if I've had it in the room and I see
a hermaphrodite I remember what the
[SPEAKER_01]: parents are I take good notes right when
it goes I don't continue that anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no need for that We've got so many
opportunities for good genetics where you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to play with anything that isn't
attentive We've got 11s now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to scale things on a 1 to 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found 11 Why do you want to mess with a
7?
[SPEAKER_00]: I seen that Mac and I was like,
oh yeah Yeah, and so let's play with the
[SPEAKER_01]: 9s and 10s and 11s and leave the
hermaphroditic 6s and 5s out of it Okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: so just as we're gonna leave this subject
Feminized seed has nothing to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodites, correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've some aphrodites have to do with
hermaphroditic plant parents them seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: are just blocking was blocking some kind
of male hormone or something Like that
[SPEAKER_00]: only allowing female seeds to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best explanation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard you give a fem so far You've
got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I maybe I'm getting it man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm Excellent, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long you've been doing fem seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been do I released fems at one of the
first cannabis cups We had here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was 2010.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, very wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right I've got a brain injury that
makes dates really fuzzy for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was giving away Yeah, I was giving away
grateful dog and heart of gold seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave away probably 10,000 seeds At a
couple of cannabis cups just walking
[SPEAKER_01]: around giving them away five seeds at a
time Oh, if you were carrying like if you
[SPEAKER_01]: had a bag with those nutrients,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw like he's gonna grow here a free
seat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so cool That way you could go home.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had everything that's set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Hey dude, so if I'll let you take
your drink, but uh, so what's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me what's first off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're bullshitting about following the
trends I mean my buddy Jaren comes over he
[SPEAKER_00]: gave me them and I can't say Jaren didn't
do anything Anyway gave me the wedding
[SPEAKER_01]: cake gave me some beautiful cuts The Mac
came from Jaren that's proper because
[SPEAKER_01]: you're supposed to give it to people that
we trust and respect So the Mac came from
[SPEAKER_01]: Jaren to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a worthy gift Wow respects you and
he knows you're gonna do well with it So
[SPEAKER_00]: that means a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you should brag that means a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, and I change it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you Jaren I appreciate you brother,
but Shit now you got me thinking just
[SPEAKER_00]: about the Mac cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang on.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we thinking about trance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah You're pretty good man podcaster
brain But trends man, so you know the Mac
[SPEAKER_00]: cut super trendy Okay, Jaren comes over to
give me that and he goes Oh change the
[SPEAKER_00]: wedding cake smell it he goes you really
get the vanilla frosting Don't you and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: like smells like weed to me and but there
and he's telling me goes Well fuels are
[SPEAKER_00]: out now sweets are in yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: How the fuck do you keep up with that
shit, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: I love to smoke that hypey stuff,
but I don't follow it in my growing or
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I avoid it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a I don't look like the most
trendy guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure well nowadays Yeah,
but these were way before most people's if
[SPEAKER_01]: I let them down you'll see I was first not
really You wait long enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I stay away from a lot of the
trends a lot of the hype stuff I do my
[SPEAKER_01]: thing what feels right to me when I see a
girl plant and a male plant, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like when you see a girl at the bar
and your friend like hey, dude You and her
[SPEAKER_01]: should talk you guys would all right,
you know who should and I'm like that with
[SPEAKER_01]: plants I'm like the the plant matchmaker
the plant porn producer That's funny who
[SPEAKER_00]: would make a good scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think of that frequently I think of
the Mac cut as like this beautiful girl
[SPEAKER_00]: with just a whole shitload of baggage with
her You know, I mean she grows slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: She blah blah, you know what I mean,
but I'll still probably hang out there for
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit I stay away from the hype.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just I dodge the trends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm obviously I'm pollinating the Mac.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that just sounds fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see what it does sure,
but I don't have Wedding cake and all that
[SPEAKER_01]: other stuff right on you don't see a lot
of that stuff in my grow I do what I like
[SPEAKER_01]: and so tell me come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's show off what you got man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in Jeffrey's a legend today I brought
some lemon Jeffrey, which camera am I
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be on right here?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got late.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah feminine I seeds This is a the lemon
skunk and golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So give me come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're the best guy to describe this shit
Paint me a picture man So if you took a
[SPEAKER_01]: box of lemon head candies, okay poured
those on the table and smelled the box
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not real overwhelmingly powerful
right but like soft lemon Kind of a dryer
[SPEAKER_01]: sheet and lemon sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think comes from here sort of a Dish
soap right flavor real big giant buds on
[SPEAKER_01]: this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not super tight on some phenotype
Some of them are a little airier that
[SPEAKER_01]: comes from the lemon scum, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that makes amazing concentrates
How many people just try comb farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: these days because then the parameters
totally change Everyone's sifting and
[SPEAKER_00]: squishing arresting now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they care about pretty buds and they
care about you Well, you got to post those
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, come on That's what social media is
all about until they shut us down and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you go to cannot buzz.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you're supposed to do Respect
respect to our friends over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a can of buzz But yeah, they're all
about the giant bud still that's that's
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be a thing for a while Most people
you're right or squishing and pressing and
[SPEAKER_01]: running it somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's either diamonds or squished,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at a show yesterday that should have
come smelled completely like weed It was
[SPEAKER_00]: back, you know, yeah, so I mean any you
know, you can smell it every now and again
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody was smoking but they're hitting
on it And you know, I mean it was so
[SPEAKER_00]: low-pro now most of the market is pens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so discreet I mean you don't smell
yeah, and if there are kids around they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know if you're smoking nicotine or
if that's a dab pen security guards that
[SPEAKER_01]: got that and they let you in they thought
that was your nicotine Yeah, I handed it
[SPEAKER_00]: to a security guard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah and like here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have fun Yeah, actually I brought two
because it you know, it was like a
[SPEAKER_00]: three-hour concert.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, and if they took one then he
had another You took both you blew my plan
[SPEAKER_01]: and you got to have one in this pocket One
in this pocket and when they pat here you
[SPEAKER_01]: go, that's my pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, and then you just walk right it
is a weird world, man There's places I go
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're like no you have to bring a
clear backpack if you want to come in I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: just like that's the future What's
happening here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some dreadlocks and look like me go
to the concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get the gloves I love agaponic Steve
potent panic Steve is always like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get searched at the airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's weird He's fun to hang out with eyes
another friend I made through this show
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm absolutely super pretty he's a
friend that I made through your show So
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm appreciative of the deal I've also got
the orange guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm orange guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm is kind of new I talk about the lemon
Jeffrey being super lemon turps,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, what orange turps we got straight up
oranges tangerines, you know, I was
[SPEAKER_00]: reading the turp book I'm trying to study
up on turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't smell them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least I can bullshit about a car
off a lane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you kind of funny I tried to send it
in a text.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not no you did it was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember how I typed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it was good type it out thinking
beta krah Yeah, me and Steve are sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: there trying to correct each other,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably saying wrong also.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's cool though But what I was gonna
say is there's one that's a Valencia or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that and there's a Valencia
orange Yeah, so there is an orange
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember I would drive by the citrus
squeeze plants in Florida and they would
[SPEAKER_00]: have big barrels of orange juice and then
it would have a little tiny barrel of
[SPEAKER_00]: something like a 25 Gallon barrel is
always so different a hundred hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: bucks as those are the terpenes right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, and all those oranges man.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got a little bit of turkey You
probably make cleaner and all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy stuff out of that one or or I wonder
if they sell it for stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Oseum Yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think this smells like the orange
Oseum if you get the orange one,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like the orange Oseum Shout out
to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean they saved my ass so many times
smoke a joint in the car smoke a bowl in
[SPEAKER_00]: the car won't go crazy and spray a little
Oseum just one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, cuz two dashes of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, the car smells like oranges for
a week This one is platinum tangy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got platinum cookies, right Angie
crossed to the Golden Goat and Feminize as
[SPEAKER_00]: well right nice as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so fucking important People give me
seeds all the time and I was looking
[SPEAKER_00]: through and being like I need some stuff
to plant I was gonna be extra for the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse and I was like, I don't want to
go on a phenol hunt Yeah, not only if you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't hunt I don't want to lose half my
crop to males and you don't want To
[SPEAKER_01]: accidentally pollinate the neighbors for
the next three miles if you forget a male
[SPEAKER_01]: and the wind comes Yeah, people forget
about that I think that's one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: things we need to pay more attention to so
yeah fem seeds for lots of new Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: readers online now They all come from
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all come They all come from within a
half mile of my mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know what everybody's cross is
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right and then I've got the the
staple the Golden Goat s1 some of those
[SPEAKER_01]: labels get confusing It's a Golden Goat
reversed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I made Golden Goat to create pollen and
put That on another Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just a self Golden Goat You know,
I heard you say Golden Goat and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: already thinking of my next question And I
just have to stop and because that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: really special strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew when I first got here Amazing
flavor to it a great plant, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: just a big just a beautiful plant Yeah,
and I mean who wasn't that made that
[SPEAKER_00]: shatter was it was it a darkness grows
grows and that beautiful orange shadow I
[SPEAKER_01]: opened that slab this smell hit my face
and came back Down and I went,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, that's the most delicious Golden Goat
and he smiled Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's absolutely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Yeah, wonderful job with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't lose with that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't you can crack it You could twist
it you can kick it over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and it just grows it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay now That's why the dude gave it to me
when I first got here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the one he gave to me He's like
let's go Scotty out set you up for success
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's partly why I love breeding
with her.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't do her wrong, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If the pH is too high or too low,
she'll go man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be alright sure likes a lot of
nutrients So you can't really overfeed
[SPEAKER_01]: her.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's real simple to work with I'm good
potency good flavor good harvest and she
[SPEAKER_00]: breeds really well now you said As long as
you're good at explaining stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm gonna take a little lesson I'll be
listening in this back and I keep on
[SPEAKER_00]: glossing over stuff How'd you get the
Golden Goat again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I want to learn this you reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you say reverse?
[SPEAKER_01]: The seeds come from making getting a
Golden Goat clone, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I treat it with the silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it and it turns it into it's basically
a male.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a male, but it's still a
female as you Got male pollen sacks with
[SPEAKER_01]: female pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it and I put that on a female plant So
it's just Golden Goat to Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the plant I didn't create it a lot
of people think I made Golden Goat I
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't I got it as a gift from my friend
who I call Pineapple Express All right,
[SPEAKER_01]: he's actually from Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Golden Goat has nothing to do with
Hawaii, but my friend Pineapple Express is
[SPEAKER_01]: from Hawaii That's what I named him.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just his nickname.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't want his real name out there So
he got that clone from another person it
[SPEAKER_01]: actually came from Mr. Dank in Topeka,
Kansas.
[SPEAKER_01]: He read yes, Topeka, Kansas.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a recycling center in Topeka Known
as the Golden Goat recycling plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a hundred degrees out here Imagine if
I had a bunch of soda bottles out there
[SPEAKER_01]: and how sweet and sticky and good that
would smell right smells like a Golden
[SPEAKER_01]: Goat plant And that's why he named it
Golden Goat after the Golden Goat
[SPEAKER_01]: recycling center Yeah, that's a lot of
people probably I get credit for it quite
[SPEAKER_01]: often and it was not me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't create that So, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, mr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dank from Topeka, Kansas.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's island sweets gun, kawaiian Sativa
and Romulan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I remember the Romulan back in the
great and that's what keeps it short and
[SPEAKER_01]: squat That's what there's the other two
are tall monster, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It keeps it short and keeps the finishing
time down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that Romulan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful great job with the Romulan
Excellent lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and I will just go back and touch on
dude feminize seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You give me a five pack I know I got five
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's big for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to pull those boys down
You'll find one that looks just like what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love those are yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope you Find a keeper in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I will I brought some for the DGC crew
also Thank you so much door prizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to share the love will do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take good care of me I Appreciate it,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're right back at you
reciprocation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what makes the world go around
respect respect respect I love being in
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you just reminded me of we got
to get Steve and go the weed there It's
[SPEAKER_00]: just outdoor weed, but it got me so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do they say?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I learned in sixth grade help set
and setting, you know who you're hanging
[SPEAKER_00]: out with yeah, and Where you're at,
I'm like just going down a river in
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaica smoking a freakin fat one Smiling
from here to here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes called Irie that feeling I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, do me a favor man Tell me a little
bit about your grow and give me a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of you gave me a we're working and
we've been collaborating lately Yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so sometimes I don't need these
concentrate companies I don't really know
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly, you know some of the specific
questions to ask so I was guessing With
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff and one of the questions he said to
me was hey, man How would these guys
[SPEAKER_00]: assure that they're delivering a really
high quality a really clean medical
[SPEAKER_00]: product, you know IPM, you know nutrients
leeching that kind of stuff Even going as
[SPEAKER_00]: far as having mold on there, you know,
or even when we have curing processes,
[SPEAKER_00]: man I'll ask you this, you know,
ask you the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not in a commercial production like
that, but What kind of advice could you
[SPEAKER_00]: give as far as IPM as far as keeping a
good making a good safe product Even I do
[SPEAKER_01]: consulting for commercial grows,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know and I'm also certified by the
Colorado Department of Agriculture
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything I do in any grow I follow
Colorado Colorado Department of
[SPEAKER_01]: Agriculture and marijuana enforcement
division pesticide guidelines,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So nothing I play in any grow that I
consult for none of my personal grows none
[SPEAKER_01]: of my breeding grows if the Colorado
Department of Ag won't let us use it I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't use it sure I'm not restricted by
those guidelines in my private grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I still choose to follow that sort of
a restriction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I mean that concentrates are exactly
what they say your cause you're taking it
[SPEAKER_00]: You think about some of the yields from
these things you take a whole plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: get three grams out of it or something
you're taking that all the essence of that
[SPEAKER_00]: whole plant or at least all the trichomes
and And concentrating it down dude up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's even a tiny fraction of pesticide
on there Oh, yeah, you know enough that
[SPEAKER_00]: you smoke a little flower and it'd be okay
now You're concentrating it down to where
[SPEAKER_00]: you're smoking, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just basically broke that back down
into a little ball It's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smelled sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tasted sulfur before the concentrate
tastes like fish or like burnt fish or
[SPEAKER_01]: something, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They use sulfur too late in their
flowering process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually what that's from and I mean I
could see that happening You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I could put it this way I can
see somebody making that mistake if I had
[SPEAKER_01]: a big pot of soup or chili How much
pesticide can I put in there that you
[SPEAKER_01]: still want to eat it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's how much you like the
people you're certainly Absolutely,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on and we've all gotten I had thrips
before I used the mammoth IPM and knocked
[SPEAKER_00]: them out for me What do you do when you
have bugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you preventing it with with other
bugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me some advice in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a spray guy I like to use a reliable
sprays in veg later on to the veg phase I
[SPEAKER_01]: like to get the the predator bugs going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to use Swarovski's Depends on what
kind of pests I think I'm gonna get right
[SPEAKER_01]: these are always the go-to nice
Swarovski's and green lace wings They're
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely Aggressive and they'll keep
anything away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you get them colonized And get them
started I like to so I do the sprays It's
[SPEAKER_01]: easier to spray smaller plants and control
them keep the moms all sprayed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's reliable And as I move toward the
flowering phase, I'll start releasing
[SPEAKER_01]: massive amounts of predator bugs My bad
ends are always filled with predators and
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to keep perpetual flowering areas
So there's always predators over here They
[SPEAKER_01]: just move to the next spot as they come in
and they're coming from the late veg
[SPEAKER_01]: plants So I like to start with sprays and
then move to the predator bugs I also do a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of defoliation if you defoliate that's
less Opportunity for a pathogen,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have a leaf that where's that
bug gonna go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on Give us give us your advice on
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: What and day.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you defoliate?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got specific days when I when I go
into flower I defoliate hard I put on the
[SPEAKER_01]: trellis I pop all the sticks I trust all
the stems I work everything into the net
[SPEAKER_01]: and I take off quite a bit of we say
twists all the stems super cropping
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically cropping put one hand here one
hand here and give it a twist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep Google that if you all don't know
that's an interesting technique It sounds
[SPEAKER_01]: just like a knuckle pops and that's how
you know, you did it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, go up a few inches and do it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let that go Let that heal about two or
three weeks and go back and do it all over
[SPEAKER_01]: again, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I like to do and that'll prevent
your stretch and early flower So I'll do
[SPEAKER_01]: that on day one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do defoliation in about week three do
some defoliation then again about week
[SPEAKER_01]: five or six Okay, and then as they mature
and harvest I'll just strip them as
[SPEAKER_01]: they're getting close to the end week
eight week nine Yeah, well a lot of times
[SPEAKER_01]: in a large commercial cultivation facility
where hundreds of lights, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'll just send a crew of dudes in
there and just say make them naked boys
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way when it comes time for
harvest You don't have all that leaf to
[SPEAKER_01]: take off you chop them hang them up Side
down you don't have that mess of
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll basically to deal with yeah,
I used to do that Easter I think it was in
[SPEAKER_00]: the 90s that people like yeah strip off
all the leaves boys You know, you only
[SPEAKER_00]: want buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I wasn't sure the technology the
science behind that so I stopped doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: You're saying you don't if you do it late
enough You're not seeing any negatives you
[SPEAKER_00]: do it late enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't see any negatives I've already
done what they're gonna do you're just
[SPEAKER_01]: working and I don't strip I'm completely
naked naked but right at the end right
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll go naked but we go up to week six
there I'm keeping some of the bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves But I take if it's got a purple
petiole that comes off like a purple for
[SPEAKER_01]: something that'll stay there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, okay Yeah, I want as much light
penetration as I can get I want as much
[SPEAKER_01]: airflow as I can get right in a big it
changes when you're in a big facility that
[SPEAKER_01]: one little spot of powdery mildew can
multiply and Pounds and pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not risking one pound like in a home.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm risking 500 pounds sure so I've got to
be a little more aggressive with my
[SPEAKER_01]: prevention and as far as PM goes you got
any advice there correct the rooms it's
[SPEAKER_01]: all about VPD we talk about VPD a lot of
our shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about proper Yeah, no micro
climates people forget that you need a fan
[SPEAKER_00]: here and sure not just way over there That
used to be my I was like I never got
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew But I'll be damned if I
didn't be go crazy with the fans you would
[SPEAKER_00]: be like dude What's up with you in these
fans?
[SPEAKER_01]: I get big floor fans and put a fan on the
floor and point it up Yep, and over there
[SPEAKER_01]: and point it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, and don't have all your fans I've
seen rooms where all the fans oscillate
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just moving you want to stir the
air Yeah, you're just moving that heat
[SPEAKER_01]: over here And move the heat over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to mix it so the heat and the cool
and the humid in the combined Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and since we're talking grow VPD is
basically vapor pressure deficit We talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about it all the time if you this is the
first time we tuned in here It's basically
[SPEAKER_00]: the pressure that's keeping the water on
to the leaf if you're able to get it
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly the leaves actually able to
Respire and breathe basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's almost like if we were in a
rubber suit, man Yeah gonna work so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're getting good at this Scotty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's my Mr. analogy coffee?
[SPEAKER_01]: Another gold star for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Appreciate I love bullshitting with you
about grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like bullshitting with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you listen to the show I'm
more about the culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more about what's interested in what's
happening now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We listen to all the same podcasts We're
into all the same shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah out with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an absolute revolution What's
happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my mother-in-law using started off
with CBD Now she hits the pen every now
[SPEAKER_00]: and again, you know, but I never would
have I don't say I never would have
[SPEAKER_00]: thought I don't It would have been hard to
imagine this I think though the easy way
[SPEAKER_00]: that we got in here is because it is
really good medicine It is super easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: convince people that this is really good
medicine Usually it just takes one hit off
[SPEAKER_00]: one of those price If you were running
things man, all right, if you had a minute
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk I would tell you my father-in-law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't believe it man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't believe you just you stay the
course actually It was weird cuz I you
[SPEAKER_00]: knew I was a grower and never admitted it
And then after it became legal and I came
[SPEAKER_00]: here and he goes up good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I just didn't want you breaking
the law like he had a problem with
[SPEAKER_00]: breaking the law not with Cannabis is
medicine or anything like that But if you
[SPEAKER_00]: were trying to convince somebody like him
that cannabis is real medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you say?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I got a minute I had a traumatic brain
injury in 2015 and I'm usually a pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: upbeat guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tell I like life, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not dark and sad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is he absolutely my brain injury had me
thinking it was tricking me into thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to Hurt myself and do bad things
to my life and I knew that wasn't right,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But my head hurts so bad and my thoughts
are so twisted from a brain injury Like my
[SPEAKER_01]: brain just my wires were fucking
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was calling purple orange I thought that
purple was orange now and I thought that a
[SPEAKER_01]: burrito was called a banana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my shit Yeah, that's where my brain was
it took a while for it to come back and
[SPEAKER_00]: then amazing how it works and they're like
Do you have something like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like I can't believe it worked in
the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: My computer was scrambled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah And then you go to the doctor and you
feel you're like, uh, no we can watch it
[SPEAKER_00]: work We kind of we don't really know how
it works though.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tried were scary One of my friends
was entering a cannabis cup for a CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said hit this and I said,
okay, right when I was smoking dabs or
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers It would make my head throb from
the injury I hit I dabbed that CBD and it
[SPEAKER_01]: felt like I had a belt around my head and
when I hit that CBD It felt like he just
[SPEAKER_01]: went back there and turned a little knob
that loosened that belt two or three
[SPEAKER_01]: notches really Oh And as soon as I hit it
and exhaled his girlfriend goes give him
[SPEAKER_01]: another one Just like they could see my
puzzle pieces just coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, whoa Like hey, hey guys,
like I'm back and there's like keep
[SPEAKER_01]: hitting this Wow So they gave me a few
days supplied like I can't give you a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: right cannabis cup entry But here's you
know, it's working hit this and so I
[SPEAKER_01]: smoked CBD first So I don't like CBD now,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I smoked CBD for several days and then
it kind of put me back on the trade sped
[SPEAKER_01]: up my healing whatever was happening In my
brain that put it back together and the
[SPEAKER_01]: 2000 wins you say that's 2015.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy crap, man That's not long ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not long ago and I'm pretty much back
to there are still things that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure You ever have the thoughts and you're
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, wait, we're I don't how did I end up
in this room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like only when I'm super duper stoned now
at the end of the joint I'll be like wait,
[SPEAKER_00]: what room am I in?
[SPEAKER_01]: See when I smoke my brain doesn't I say
that there's like a skip on my record
[SPEAKER_01]: wherever I hit right my record was spin
and I dinged it right there and so and so
[SPEAKER_01]: and so Sometimes I record skip,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right when I smoke that little they wipe
off the skips on my record when I dab like
[SPEAKER_01]: the lemon Jeffrey's your golden code The
right strains will just clean my my skips
[SPEAKER_01]: right on up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that's amazing I didn't want to
kill myself anymore from consuming CBD and
[SPEAKER_01]: that sounds really weird to say but rising
It wasn't like me being crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a brain injury an injury that this
thing saw I mean CBD really does have
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-inflammatory properties I mean if you
think about what inflammation is Shove it
[SPEAKER_00]: everything together that don't need to be
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need Our space man My three brain
cells that get along we're fighting in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ain't getting clustered together Yeah,
dude, but you were in business then right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, how the fuck do you keep motivated
when you got something like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you keep motivated in general man?
[SPEAKER_00]: You just get up every day mansion dude the
passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love cannabis I loved it before my brain
injury it sure my my smile you can tell I
[SPEAKER_01]: talked too much and it Talked to me just
right brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would talk too much then if I didn't
consume Right, but so the brain injury the
[SPEAKER_01]: just the passion and then I became a
caregiver and I was involved in the
[SPEAKER_01]: medical marijuana from the beginning very
cool people would come to our dispensary
[SPEAKER_01]: and we would I had time then at
dispensaries to sit just like this right
[SPEAKER_01]: what's wrong and they would say it hurts
and I would say where and they would tell
[SPEAKER_01]: me how and where and I'd say oh you want
this strain and we'd actually get to
[SPEAKER_01]: develop that so I would see young guys
like you and I and little old ladies and
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody all walks of life would come in
and After a week of talking to me and
[SPEAKER_01]: consuming a product I recommend They would
I would see improvement in their quality
[SPEAKER_01]: of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a better smile Yeah, maybe a little
more pep in their step and do that puts
[SPEAKER_01]: something in you that is irreplaceable I'm
a father and that that's a magical feeling
[SPEAKER_01]: that thing when you see other people
healed from a product you made so true is
[SPEAKER_00]: the next best thing The next best yeah,
it's funny We were talking about this book
[SPEAKER_00]: that I read and it talks about the joy of
being able to actually produce something
[SPEAKER_00]: and then say that seeing something that
you produce like be enjoyed It gives you
[SPEAKER_00]: like a fulfillment the book was about A
lot of people don't get that anymore
[SPEAKER_00]: because we stopped producing most stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah We just talked about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I get to make seeds I get to teach
people how to grow right I see people grow
[SPEAKER_01]: those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see people grow for other people sure I
see my best friend Mike he smokes a
[SPEAKER_01]: product I grow he shows up to my house
going my fucking back hurts dude takes two
[SPEAKER_01]: dabs and goes Thank you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's the dab and the social
interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are medicinal therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're making people feel better And then
to keep me motivated dude, I've got the
[SPEAKER_01]: DGC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the ivory army Anytime I wake up
and I'm like, oh, it's a bummer day.

awesome people saying killer podcast.

[SPEAKER_00]: talk about checking out the one negative
the hundred people that say nice things
[SPEAKER_00]: and all our friends it does Drown it out
very significantly.

works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, you don't want that bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make everybody happy You know
what?

They stamp out that fire, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a potential problem there when
somebody falls you want to pick them up.

[SPEAKER_01]: I try to do I give credit to the people
who taught me I had a lot of times I say I
[SPEAKER_01]: learned this from this person,

so that I don't feel like I'm the wizard
[SPEAKER_01]: of Oz No, we all from other sources a lot
of them.
