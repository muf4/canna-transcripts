[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_02]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to Kat, Koot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, this episode of the
podcast is brought to you by my friends at
[SPEAKER_02]: the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need new genetics for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_02]: Company.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find them at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I like to start these episodes
off by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today I've been taking dabs of Skywalker
live batter from our friends at the Garden
[SPEAKER_02]: of Whedon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been talking about this in the past
couple of episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has got a great Skywalker aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's earthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got some gas to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a little bit of a funk to it,
and it definitely gives me a super nice
[SPEAKER_02]: head high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice, relaxing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes my eyes nice and mellow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes me nice and chilled out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, I've been smoking on some
flowers today, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had some friends stop by.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to my friends who dropped in.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know who they are, and they brought
me some amazing gifts.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was gifted, it looks like, about an
eighth of a cup of lemon sun-rise flowers
[SPEAKER_02]: from our friends at Organ-tica.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, lemon sun-rise.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's lemon jeffery, which is a strain-eye
bread crossed to the arise, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: another strain-eye bread.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I cross them together,
and I made the lemon sun-rise.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I crack this container open,
I can smell the lemon jeffery just come
[SPEAKER_02]: jumping out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is bright green.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is covered in trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great work, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great work with the lemon sun-rise.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm smelling it right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like lemons and funk,
and it is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the gift.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, this is the one that really got
my attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bred this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our friends at Organ-tica grew it,
and they did a marvelous job.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cream is cookies and cream number 13
from Exotic Genetics crossed to my arise.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm gonna open up the container here
and give this a little bit of a smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a, oh, there's so many different
things going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a hint of a peppery-ness,
a hint of the Girl Scout cookie strain,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also more dominating that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like the foam of an A&W cream
soda, or if you go to a nice Italian
[SPEAKER_02]: restaurant and you get an Italian,
a vanilla Italian cream soda, it smells
[SPEAKER_02]: like the foam on top of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a really soft yet funky smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just keep smelling it over and over,
hoping that it will come through the
[SPEAKER_02]: microphone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not working.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I'm glad that these guys brought
me some of the cream because a lot of my
[SPEAKER_02]: listeners have been asking for another
episode where I highlight a strain that I
[SPEAKER_02]: have bred.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this episode, of course, is going to be
about the cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk a little bit about the cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sample I've got in front of me today
was grown by our friends at Organ-tica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Organ-tica is in Albuquerque, New Mexico,
if I failed to mention that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks to my friends for driving from
Albuquerque to come hang out with me
[SPEAKER_02]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sample that they brought me tested at
27.4% THCA.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this will be the sample that I'm
talking about in the episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be my reminder, my visual and
odoriferous representation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I have grown this a bunch of
times, so I've got a lot of ideas of what
[SPEAKER_02]: this strain does and what to expect from
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about the cream a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been rambling long enough to set it
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get right down to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cream from Irie Genetics is Cookies
and Cream Number 13 from Exotic Genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the cut that is known for winning a
bunch of concentrate awards.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is Girl Scout Cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: They say it's an unknown phenotype of Girl
Scout Cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's either the Thin Mint, the Platinum
Cookies, or the Forum Cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Judging by the aromas, I would say it is
the Forum Cookies that I am very familiar
[SPEAKER_02]: with.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the Forum Cookies crossed to
Starfighter.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is Starfighter?
[SPEAKER_02]: Starfighter is alien Tahoe OG and lemon
alien dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got some Tahoe OG funk in there and
you got some dog funk plus lemon in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they crossed the Girl Scout Cookies
to the Starfighter, it made Cookies and
[SPEAKER_02]: Cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: The clone that I got makes a lot of
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes very, very frosty light-colored
buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem with it is it didn't grow very
well for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't produce enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was using it in a commercial grow and it
was going to get me fired if I kept
[SPEAKER_02]: growing that strain in a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I bred it to the Arise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Arise is Golden Goat to Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Golden Goat is Island Sweet Skunk,
Hawaiian Sativa, and Romulan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Daybreaker is Chem Dog D to Joseph OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about the Daybreaker because
that's where a lot of things start.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Daybreaker, Chem Dog D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chem Dog, it's got a rubber, a burnt
rubber sort of a smell, but a funky gas
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of a thing, and a fuel sort of a
smell, and a dirty feet thing happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they took the Chem D and crossed that
to Joseph OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joseph OG is an OG Kush phenotype that
smells like earth and fuel and funk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's got this just pungent nose
wrinkling thing to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Daybreaker came out as a funky foot
smelling OG Kush that grew like Chem D and
[SPEAKER_02]: had some fuel to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a, when you dry it and cure it
properly, it smells like a package of
[SPEAKER_02]: fresh tennis balls or car tires,
but in a good way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was the Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was crossed to the Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Golden Goat has all of those tropical
things going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got the Island Sweet Skunk,
and the Sativa or the Hawaiian Sativa that
[SPEAKER_02]: gives it a tropical, jungle-y sort of
bubblegummy, juicy fruit sort of a flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it's got the Romulan in there to give
it a better structure and a better
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I crossed those, the Golden Goat to the
Daybreaker to create the Arise.
[SPEAKER_02]: The male that I use is known as King
Solomon.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Golden Goat brings out a really
tropical flavor and the Daybreaker gives
[SPEAKER_02]: it a really great structure and dense buds
and big plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So King Solomon to Cookies and Cream
number 13 from Exotic Genetics makes the
[SPEAKER_02]: cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: I call it the cream because the cream
rises to the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also smells like the cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like the cream from an Italian
cream soda or maybe some really fancy
[SPEAKER_02]: coffee creamer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells delightful.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's talk more about the strain and
how it grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned earlier that the Cookies and
Cream number 13 was kind of a slow grower
[SPEAKER_02]: and a shitty yielder.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, she made some of the best water
hash I have ever experienced.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ice hash, water hash, rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Cookies and Cream 13 made some of the
best non-solvent concentrates ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it just didn't yield a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it did have an amazing flavor and a
great high.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I pollinated it with the Arise,
it increased the vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It increased the yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kept the trichome production and it
gave several new flavors to the palette.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about growing a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cream likes to go about 60 days,
maybe a little longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: 70 is usually enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flavor is there when you cut it a
little bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you let it go a little longer,
that soft, the vanilla cream flavor starts
[SPEAKER_02]: to disappear if you let it go too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe 65 days, 70 is usually more than
enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: It likes to get fairly tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some phenos.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: It likes to get fairly tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna get tall, long, skinny buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to need supports.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna either need steaks,
tomato cages, or a trellis.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do trellis, you're gonna need two,
maybe three layers of trellis,
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on how tall your plants are.
[SPEAKER_02]: These plants like to end up kind of a
white, silvery, golden color at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the color.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna look at some of these buds that
we've got from our friends here at
[SPEAKER_02]: Organica.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are really light green, but they are
coated in trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And something I should mention is they are
rock hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna turn the microphone toward the
computer and I'm gonna just drop this onto
[SPEAKER_02]: my MacBook so you can hear how dense this
bud is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be able to hear this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a bud hitting my MacBook,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how dense these nuggets are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great grow on this, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: The folks that grew this did a hell of a
good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job, boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're gonna get super dense buds,
super dense.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not a strain to grow if you're
looking for a big, donkey dick,
[SPEAKER_02]: giant cola.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want a glory cola, this isn't the
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say get yourself a pack of Arise
or Lemon Sunrise if you want that giant
[SPEAKER_02]: cola.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is gonna make smaller buds,
but they are coated in trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the aroma and the high are amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's gonna get kind of tall on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have some supports ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: Multiple layers of trellis.
[SPEAKER_02]: She likes to be defoliated, but don't go
too crazy because you'll piss her off if
[SPEAKER_02]: you defoliate it too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't like to be overwatered.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cream does not like overwatering.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think she does better with medium
amounts of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: She would rather have a little bit of dry
time instead of getting soaked.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let her dry up a little bit and she
will do okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay attention to her.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta pay attention to let her get
crunchy dry, but let your medium get a
[SPEAKER_02]: little more dry than you normally would
with most of your other strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she's gonna have a bunch of great,
unique smells.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smells like vanilla and Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that Girl Scout Cookies has a
Durban poison plus black pepper sort of a
[SPEAKER_02]: smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll get that out of some of the
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The black pepper isn't as dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think all the alien crosses,
the lemon alien and the alien Tahoe kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of crossed out the pepper turp.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that got removed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're gonna find vanilla.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna find Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna find that cream soda turp.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's got like an anise and cream
soda sort of a thing going on and I
[SPEAKER_02]: really, really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: These flowers that I've got look very
close to what the cookies and cream
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers that I used to grow looked like.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this looks very similar to mommy,
but it's got a better smell and it seems
[SPEAKER_02]: to have a tighter bud structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can tell by looking at this that
this would make amazing rosin or amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to have bubble hash made and then
we would press the bubble hash into rosin
[SPEAKER_02]: and that was some of the best concentrates
we smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you ever shopped at Green and Healthy
Wellness back in the day and got the cream
[SPEAKER_02]: rosin, that's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: That stuff was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk more about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've talked about the smells.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've talked about the grow time.
[SPEAKER_02]: pH, this one, this plant likes to play
some tricks on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will look like it's got a problem,
but that's just the colors that the leaves
[SPEAKER_02]: make.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having Girl Scout Cookies in it means that
you're gonna get some dark leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: coloration.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's gonna look like you've got pH
problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it around 6'3 to 6'5 and she should
be happy with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, one thing I noticed that will
correct her is she likes a little amino
[SPEAKER_02]: acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was feeding her the amino from
Photosynthesis Plus and it really seemed
[SPEAKER_02]: to make her happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made all those weird leaf colors kind
of minimize and it worked a little better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, too much Cal Mag will piss her off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too much Cal Mag will piss off the cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why, but it does not seem to
like a whole lot of Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of those OG Kush strains love the Cal
Mag.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can overdose the cream really,
really easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a couple of different
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a small phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is kind of shitty, but if you are
running a small grow, the smaller
[SPEAKER_02]: phenotype that doesn't branch out a lot,
it grows straight up and it makes very
[SPEAKER_02]: minimal side branching.
[SPEAKER_02]: That thing would be amazing for a small
sea of greens or a green single cola type
[SPEAKER_02]: of grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you find that one and you're running a
small hut, I would do a four by four or a
[SPEAKER_02]: five by five table with like four rows of
four or five rows of five, do 16 or 20
[SPEAKER_02]: small plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That cream phenotype that grows straight
up would be perfect for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just gonna grow one long sphere of
resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not gonna branch out at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not gonna have any side branching
on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where that came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where in the genetic line
that happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not supposed to happen with this
cross, but that's a phenotype that will
[SPEAKER_02]: pop up.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you like that, it is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not into that cola, you'll be
able to notice it fairly early into the
[SPEAKER_02]: grow process.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the one that just goes straight up.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the others are having side
branching happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one just goes straight up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be taller than everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may think it's a male.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may not be a male.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may just be the phenotype that goes
straight up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little slower growing, so you
should be able to find it, but call that
[SPEAKER_02]: one unless you want that one single cola
type plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other ones, there are phenotypes that
get quite branchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recommend that you top this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Top it aggressively.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go low because it's gonna stretch out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to fill in the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will probably double in height when you
flower it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a plant that's a foot and a
half tall, you're gonna have a three foot
[SPEAKER_02]: tall plant by the end of flower,
so give yourself plenty of head space if
[SPEAKER_02]: you are working with the cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost every phenotype produces heavy,
heavy resin, mad resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just as a hint, there is one phenotype
that is super leafy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is not my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one with the minimal leaves that shoot
out the purple pedials and the crazy
[SPEAKER_02]: looking leaves, that is the keeper on the
cream, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one that has this beautiful
root beer cream soda sort of flavor,
[SPEAKER_02]: so maybe that'll help you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the tall, skinny one.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're growing a screen of green type
of thing or a sea of green, there's that
[SPEAKER_02]: tall, skinny one.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want the single cola, then there's
the one that branches out, and it's got
[SPEAKER_02]: long pedials and crazy leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll start curling up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great sign.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the phenotype that I like.
[SPEAKER_02]: The phenotype that puts out a lot of leaf,
she does harvest a little better.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, she doesn't have that aroma that
I really, really enjoy from the cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully you can find the one that puts
out a ton of resin, the one that's got
[SPEAKER_02]: that cream soda flavor, and the one that
puts out good weight, and also the one
[SPEAKER_02]: that flowers right at 63 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the great one right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The longer the pedial, the more resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like happens with this particular
strain, and those more jagged leaves seem
[SPEAKER_02]: to be a sign of the more desirable
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: The wider the leaf, the less desirable
phenotype, in my opinion, when it comes to
[SPEAKER_02]: the cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want the one that looks like it's
going to cut you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got very skinny, very serrated
leaves, and they're hanging off of a very
[SPEAKER_02]: long pedial, and then the bud makes long,
skinny spears that are coated in resin,
[SPEAKER_02]: so that's the one you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something else I should be sure to
mention, I keep talking about this cream
[SPEAKER_02]: soda flavor that doesn't really come out
until it's dried and cured and harvested.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a green smell to it as it's
growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry if it doesn't smell like
cookies and cream, and cream, and cream
[SPEAKER_02]: soda, and vanilla until the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll have a danker, cushier plant sort of
a smell, but as you dry it and cure it and
[SPEAKER_02]: it loses that chlorophyll, that's when
that vanilla aroma really starts to come
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The longer you keep it cured, it feels
like the drier it gets, the softer the
[SPEAKER_02]: buds become, the more that aroma just
comes out, and it gets more vanilla-y as
[SPEAKER_02]: time goes on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets richer, but also softer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how to describe a soft
vanilla smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: If somebody asked me for an iry genetic
strain that I would recommend for making
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrates that are not BHO
concentrates, like water hash,
[SPEAKER_02]: ice hash, sift, rosin, anything in that
realm, the cream would be my first
[SPEAKER_02]: recommendation because it puts off a lot
of trichomes, and the flavor is so
[SPEAKER_02]: delicious, and that flavor transfers very
well with water extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're using a rosin press or if you're
making ice hash, the cream is the strain
[SPEAKER_02]: for you, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so a couple of quick grow tips
before I wrap up my breakdown of the
[SPEAKER_02]: cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cream is going to grow tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've mentioned that a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_02]: It likes to skyrocket in early flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get that 21-day stretch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something you can do to help prevent that,
right before you go to flower,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe a week before flower, go in and pop
the stems.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've talked about this before.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call it supercropping.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can grab the plant with one hand and
then grab it two or three inches above
[SPEAKER_02]: that with the other hand and give it a
little twist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turn your hands opposite directions.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to break the cellulose structure
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want it to sound like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just give it a little twist and make it
pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to do a little damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good for the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to get stronger right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also going to slow it down from
stretching so that it doesn't get so darn
[SPEAKER_02]: tall because the cream likes to get
taller.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good way to slow it down from
getting out of control.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also recommend having some steaks or
some trellis or a tomato cage because when
[SPEAKER_02]: it starts getting tall, those top buds,
they're going to start swaying around and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to wish you had supports on
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, if she starts making weird colors
and it looks like she's got a pH issue,
[SPEAKER_02]: she probably doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just something this plant does.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of her traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: She makes dark colored leaves on some
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: She can also be very sensitive to Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't overdose her on the Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also think she tastes better if you
don't feed her too much nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most cannabis plants are that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one works well with minimal
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to want to beef her up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to want to feed her stuff to
make her go harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: This plant's not going to grow gigantic
colas.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll grow long, skinny, tall colas,
but it's not going to make big beefy
[SPEAKER_02]: colas.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a connoisseur plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to get more quality over
quantity.
[SPEAKER_02]: You will get good yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can pull two pounds of light with almost
every strain with the cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just takes a little bit of extra work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to do a little bit of super
cropping.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to do some popping.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to do trellising.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to work the trellis and work the
cannabis a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to pay attention to every detail
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to dial it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, if you get a little bit cold,
this plant will slow down a little bit on
[SPEAKER_02]: you and it'll stop working.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't get too cold at night or she will
start stalling on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a quick breakdown of the cream
from iRegenetics.

hear this.
