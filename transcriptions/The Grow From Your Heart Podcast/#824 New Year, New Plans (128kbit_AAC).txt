[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy New Year podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 824 of the grow from your
heart podcast I've got a fun show lined up
[SPEAKER_00]: for us in this episode I want to talk
about starting the new year strong in our
[SPEAKER_00]: grow space Before I get to that part of
the show I do want to send a big thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: to everybody who supported the grow from
your heart podcast I read genetics Rasta
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff or the iry army in any way in 2023
big Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate all of the support
Alright, I feel like I covered the cheesy
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the show now Let's jump into the
main topic of today's podcast This episode
[SPEAKER_00]: will come out right at the start of the
new year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy New Year everybody I want to talk
about setting ourselves up for success in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2024 One of the first things I want to do
to start the new year is I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: clean my grow space a hundred percent I'm
going to clean every nook and cranny every
[SPEAKER_00]: inch of the grow space from top to bottom
Then I'm going to clean my nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: storage and mixing area Then it will clean
my pesticide storage and mixing area then
[SPEAKER_00]: it will clean all of the gear Everything
will be shiny and brand new to start the
[SPEAKER_00]: new year It will take me a little bit of
time to do this But I feel like the time
[SPEAKER_00]: that I spend doing this will probably
speed me up over the next few weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: Because then I will know where all of my
gear is all the nutrients will be lined up
[SPEAKER_00]: in the right spot All the mixing stuff
will be clean and ready to go Sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the time I do try to put my stuff
away and clean up after myself and be an
[SPEAKER_00]: organized good little grow guy But we all
know that sometimes we get in a rush
[SPEAKER_00]: Things get overlooked things get set in
the wrong place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some messes get overlooked for a little
bit here at the start of the year I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to clean all of that stuff up
reorganize and I do believe that it will
[SPEAKER_00]: save me time just by reorganizing and
cleaning up my mess putting in a few
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes now will save me time over the
next couple of weeks So the first thing
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do is clean up my grow space
Now the second thing I did in my grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already done this part I may
recommend you do it too if you are using
[SPEAKER_00]: the same type of equipment It is winter
time here in Colorado, which means I am
[SPEAKER_00]: now using HPS lighting in my grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know those lights are old Those are
dinosaurs, but sometimes they work in the
[SPEAKER_00]: right conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a basement grow in Colorado
lately It has been super cold and guess
[SPEAKER_00]: what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those HPS lights are keeping it just right
in that grow space So I just recently hung
[SPEAKER_00]: two HPS lights to keep it warm for the
winter conditions when I hung those HPS
[SPEAKER_00]: lights I put two brand new bulbs in the
fixtures when I did that I got a piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: duct tape and I wrote down the date when I
put those new bulbs and those fixtures and
[SPEAKER_00]: now I know exactly when those bulbs were
placed in those fixtures if you are using
[SPEAKER_00]: HPS bulbs and you cannot remember when the
last time you replaced them was I Strongly
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend you do it here at the start of
the year And make a note of when you put
[SPEAKER_00]: those bulbs in there I do try to replace
those bulbs every two maybe three crops
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a good idea to write down the
date when you put those bulbs in there So,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know exactly how long they've been in
there then occasionally bust out your
[SPEAKER_00]: light meter I don't know if you've got a
real light meter I don't know if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using the photon app bust out Whatever you
use find a distance from that light that
[SPEAKER_00]: is consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe go 12 18 inches Just do it
consistently every time and take a reading
[SPEAKER_00]: see how much light that bulb is putting
out if you've lost more than 20 or 30
[SPEAKER_00]: Percent of the output of that bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to swap that bulb because you're
paying for a hundred percent of the
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity If you're not getting the
light out of that bulb, it is time to
[SPEAKER_00]: switch it out for efficiency So I would
recommend adding new bulbs and writing
[SPEAKER_00]: down the date of when those bulbs were
added Also, if you're running LEDs,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep in mind those lights do degrade over
time The manufacturers don't want you to
[SPEAKER_00]: believe and know that they do degrade,
but they definitely do degrade over time
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes much longer than an HPS bulb,
but those LEDs do lose efficiency over
[SPEAKER_00]: time So maybe think about testing those as
well start testing those here at the start
[SPEAKER_00]: of the year now I did start the podcast
off by saying we were going to clean up
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow space, but let's focus on
cleaning everything I just said that I
[SPEAKER_00]: hung those HPS lights those HPS lights
have a glass shield between the bulb and
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow space and the heat is kept in
there and it's moved out by a duck so that
[SPEAKER_00]: heat can never make it into the grow now
is a good time to clean that glass on
[SPEAKER_00]: those hoods if you've got hooded lights
with glass on there get in the turn the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights off let it cool and then clean that
glass it is also a good time to clean your
[SPEAKER_00]: air conditioner filter if your air
conditioner has filters get in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: clean those filters also let's deep clean
the dehumidifier that dehumidifier has
[SPEAKER_00]: probably got some gunk in it let's take it
all apart and clean it thoroughly I'm sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you've been doing the mini clean the quick
clean but let's give it the long clean
[SPEAKER_00]: let's take it out of the room take every
component and part out that you can figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out how to take out and clean it very
clean and put it in there brand new so
[SPEAKER_00]: that we've got a fresh clean dehumidifier
also let's clean up the humidifier if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not using RO water your humidifier
and dehumidifier are going to have calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: and other minerals built up in them now is
a good time to clean those and make them
[SPEAKER_00]: brand new now since we're cleaning all of
the equipment it is also a good time to
[SPEAKER_00]: clean out our reservoirs and all of our
watering equipment I don't know if you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got a giant rez I don't know if you're
using a trash can I don't know if you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got a couple of five gallon buckets I
don't know if you're using a pitcher or a
[SPEAKER_00]: water wand but how ever you do it let's
clean up all of our watering and
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation equipment I would recommend a
product called Fizan 20 use Fizan 20 as
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended on the bottle mix that up and
use it to clean your reservoir your
[SPEAKER_00]: buckets also use it to clean your watering
pitcher if you use a watering wand in a
[SPEAKER_00]: pump you can run the Fizan 20 right
through there just make sure to rinse and
[SPEAKER_00]: clean everything thoroughly with clean
water after using the Fizan let's not feed
[SPEAKER_00]: any Fizan 20 to our plants they will not
enjoy that but it's a great product it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: make everything smell hospital clean and
it will remove all of the pathogens in
[SPEAKER_00]: your watering equipment so let's clean
that up like I said if you got a big
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir clean that up if you got a big
trash can on wheels clean that up if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just using buckets let's clean
those up and let's clean up the watering
[SPEAKER_00]: pitcher if you just got a pitcher if
you're using a water wand if you're using
[SPEAKER_00]: a pitcher whatever you're using let's just
clean that up make it look fresh and clean
[SPEAKER_00]: for the new year that will also help you
mitigate problems in the future all right
[SPEAKER_00]: we're talking about cleaning everything
also I've got perhaps maybe there are
[SPEAKER_00]: cameras in my grow space when I worked in
a commercial environment we would have to
[SPEAKER_00]: take a day just to go around and clean all
of the lenses on all of the cameras so if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got cameras in your grow space get
a ladder get out that cleaning rag that
[SPEAKER_00]: little microfiber rag and let's clean the
lenses on our cameras so that we can see
[SPEAKER_00]: everything nice and clearly in our grow
space when we're trying to creep on our
[SPEAKER_00]: grow when we're far from home and making
sure everything is okay now that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about creeping on the grow far
from home let's also make sure that all of
[SPEAKER_00]: our monitoring equipment is calibrated and
hung in the right place sometimes I'll go
[SPEAKER_00]: into a grow room and I'll notice that the
the sensors for your AC infinity are not
[SPEAKER_00]: in any useful positions the plants are
growing here they're about this high and
[SPEAKER_00]: that AC infinity the little the sensor
piece is way up here get that sort of near
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants so that we kind of know what's
going on with the plants right make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that all of your gear is in the right spot
and then all of that gear is calibrated
[SPEAKER_00]: let's check all the cycles on all of our
stuff too I don't know what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: programmable controllers you've got but
let's check and make sure that everything
[SPEAKER_00]: is working the way we think it is run
through your programs run through your
[SPEAKER_00]: time make sure everything is set the way
you expect it to be something might be
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in there that you don't even
know about let's just check and verify all
[SPEAKER_00]: of our settings now since we're checking
and verifying settings you know I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk about it soon in this episode
let's calibrate all of our testing
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment that's right if you've got a ph
pin a big ph meter a combo meter let's
[SPEAKER_00]: clean it and calibrate that I definitely
recommend calibrating your ph meter at
[SPEAKER_00]: least once a week
[SPEAKER_00]: so right here at the start of the year
let's make it a habit let's calibrate our
[SPEAKER_00]: ph pins let's clean and calibrate our ph
pins then let's get a little notebook get
[SPEAKER_00]: a log and write down today January 1st I
cleaned and calibrated my ph pins I also
[SPEAKER_00]: added new bulbs in this one room we're
going to add a lot more stuff to this
[SPEAKER_00]: little notebook this journal that we talk
about here later in the episode let's keep
[SPEAKER_00]: it moving let's calibrate our gear the ph
pins let's clean them and calibrate them
[SPEAKER_00]: also let's clean our ec meters if you're
using an ec meter let's clean it because
[SPEAKER_00]: those things will get gunky over time and
they work better if they're clean all
[SPEAKER_00]: right where do we go from there now is a
good time to do inventory inventory you
[SPEAKER_00]: might say yes we're going to go through a
lot of nutrients over the next year if
[SPEAKER_00]: everything goes our way we're going to run
a few crops with a lot of plants we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to need nutrients we also are going
to need pesticides let's go in the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: and see which bottles have been around for
too long it may need to be tossed out
[SPEAKER_00]: these things do expire I would not keep
nutrients around for more than a year so
[SPEAKER_00]: if you got some old shit write that down I
need to replace this bottle toss that old
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle order a new bottle pick up all the
bottles and give them a shake what's low
[SPEAKER_00]: do you have anything that you need to
replace check on your nutrients check on
[SPEAKER_00]: your pesticides and let's make an order
and replace all of the things that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to need for the next couple of weeks
maybe the next grow that way we've got
[SPEAKER_00]: everything on hand that way there are no
surprises we don't run out of anything
[SPEAKER_00]: through the grow cycle set yourself up for
success today let's plan the whole grow
[SPEAKER_00]: ahead right now while we're thinking about
it now I did say let's do an inventory of
[SPEAKER_00]: the pesticides and our nutrients also
let's think about personal protective
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment I'm not sure how big your grow
is I don't know your pesticide routine if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to spray frequently you may
need a lot of Tyvek suits if you only
[SPEAKER_00]: spray every so often you don't need as
many Tyvek suits maybe you're not even a
[SPEAKER_00]: Tyvek guy maybe you are I like the suits
it just makes it nice and easy I can tuck
[SPEAKER_00]: my dreads behind myself and zip it right
up into the suit put on some gloves some
[SPEAKER_00]: booties and a mask I'm ready to rock also
speaking of the mask if you're using
[SPEAKER_00]: ventilation it may be time to order those
new cartridges if you've got a respirator
[SPEAKER_00]: mask let's replace the 3m cartridges on
our mask and on our little log let's make
[SPEAKER_00]: a note I swapped out the cartridges here
read the package let's see how long those
[SPEAKER_00]: cartridges are good for I don't remember I
don't want to give you poor advice but
[SPEAKER_00]: write down when you should change those
and then maybe order the extras next now
[SPEAKER_00]: so then when it comes time to change the
cartridges on your 3m respirator you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got backup carts ready to go let's order a
bunch of rubber gloves while we're at it
[SPEAKER_00]: we're always going to run out of gloves I
go through at least one or two pairs of
[SPEAKER_00]: gloves every day in my grow space if I've
got a helper that's another pair of gloves
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're trimming harvesting you go
through excessive gloves order a box of
[SPEAKER_00]: gloves right now while you're thinking
about it and then see how long it takes I
[SPEAKER_00]: said see how long we'll stay focused see
how long it takes you to run through that
[SPEAKER_00]: box of gloves and then order more as
necessary and then you can start to see
[SPEAKER_00]: what it costs and when to anticipate
ordering things trying to get you on top
[SPEAKER_00]: of staying on top of this so that you can
get comfortable ordering things before we
[SPEAKER_00]: run out of them now another good thing to
think about is have you tested your fire
[SPEAKER_00]: extinguisher you should have a fire
extinguisher near or around to the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space you should have one in your home
anyway you never know you could catch some
[SPEAKER_00]: shit on fire while you're cooking you can
be taking a dab and cause a problem there
[SPEAKER_00]: should be a fire extinguisher handy
especially if you're growing have you
[SPEAKER_00]: checked on it look at that fire
extinguisher it's got a gauge on it it's
[SPEAKER_00]: got a little red a yellow and a green if
it's not in the green you need to get that
[SPEAKER_00]: thing charged or replaced right away
recently there was a great sale on fire
[SPEAKER_00]: extinguishers I'm not advertising I was at
Costco and I picked up two new fire
[SPEAKER_00]: extinguishers because they were on a
really good sale price I got one that is
[SPEAKER_00]: designed for electrical fires and one that
was designed I think it's just household
[SPEAKER_00]: or all around I forget the other one one
is specifically for electrical fires I set
[SPEAKER_00]: that next to the grow space because I
anticipate any problem would be caused by
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity in there right so I got the
one for electrical fires you get what you
[SPEAKER_00]: feel will best suit your needs but I
recommend a fire extinguisher I really
[SPEAKER_00]: hope you never need it I prayed a job that
I never need mine but I would rather have
[SPEAKER_00]: it and not need it than need it and not
have it that's just the way I roll set
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself up for success is what I'm
talking about now that fire extinguisher
[SPEAKER_00]: what else could go well with that fire
extinguisher you say that quickly while
[SPEAKER_00]: you're thinking about nine other things
what else do we need with the fire
[SPEAKER_00]: extinguisher possibly a smoke detector a
smoke alarm may be a good idea the thing
[SPEAKER_00]: about a smoke detector is when that goes
off are you going to be the one that
[SPEAKER_00]: responds to that or is it going to be
somebody else in your area do you have
[SPEAKER_00]: nosy neighbors are you in a part in an
apartment building in a condo think about
[SPEAKER_00]: that sort of stuff we do want to be
notified of a fire but who's it going to
[SPEAKER_00]: notify maybe you want to be the only one
notified so think about that stay safe but
[SPEAKER_00]: think about those sorts of things now
since we're talking about smoke alarms
[SPEAKER_00]: that makes me think about a few more
security things we can think about like I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned a moment ago I do have cameras
in my grow space now is a good time to go
[SPEAKER_00]: reset the passwords on those cameras if
you've got any sort of security system
[SPEAKER_00]: cameras or maybe anything that is
accessible online through a password maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: just routinely go and change those
passwords there's a reason why a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: services do request you to update your
password every so often if it's your
[SPEAKER_00]: security for your grow space if it's your
camera for your grow space if it's your ac
[SPEAKER_00]: infinity that you're accessing maybe go
change that password just for peace of
[SPEAKER_00]: mind do it often and make sure you
document that password when you change it
[SPEAKER_00]: but go change that password here at the
start of the year just to shake off
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that may have followed you
another thing you can work on implementing
[SPEAKER_00]: or updating here at the start of the year
is your integrated pest management system
[SPEAKER_00]: what have you been doing to keep bugs out
of your grow and what are you going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be doing to keep bugs out of your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: so that that way those bugs have no chance
of getting in there and colonizing make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure you're always looking and make sure
you're applying pesticides or releasing
[SPEAKER_00]: predators on a regular schedule now
speaking of regular schedule here is
[SPEAKER_00]: something new that I have not talked about
a lot that I probably never mentioned in
[SPEAKER_00]: one of these yearly episodes where we set
ourselves up for success but I have
[SPEAKER_00]: recently become very paranoid of
hoplatinviroid I've done an episode about
[SPEAKER_00]: it I am not qualified to teach you in
depth about it so hoplatinviroid is a
[SPEAKER_00]: virus that came from the hops family
that's why it's called hoplatinviroid the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is hops is very close cousin so
it is transferred over to the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants this virus is you won't even know
it's in your plants unless you use lab
[SPEAKER_00]: testing but what will happen is you'll
grow your plant and it'll look totally
[SPEAKER_00]: happy totally healthy and then in mid
flower it will just dud out and start to
[SPEAKER_00]: look weak and bored it'll start to look
like it's losing energy and it will slowly
[SPEAKER_00]: die in front of you plants that used to
give you three pounds per light will now
[SPEAKER_00]: give you a quarter pound per light and
you'll be disappointed and angry that is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably hoplatinviroid it is
non-detectable by the human eye you have
[SPEAKER_00]: got to get a lab test on these plants to
detect the virus so I have become super
[SPEAKER_00]: paranoid of incoming clones incoming
plants anything that comes into my grow
[SPEAKER_00]: before it makes it to general population
it actually stops right here on this table
[SPEAKER_00]: and I take a testing sample from it and
send that to a lab and they test for the
[SPEAKER_00]: presence of hoplatinviroid before that
plant ever makes it into one of my grow
[SPEAKER_00]: spaces one of my new habits that I'm
putting into practice here in this year is
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm lab testing every plant before it
makes it to the grow and I am also
[SPEAKER_00]: regularly that means every six to eight
weeks I am testing plants in my grow to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure nobody has snuck in any
hoplatinviroid along the way I did start
[SPEAKER_00]: testing my plants recently for HLV but
here at the start of the year I will be
[SPEAKER_00]: much more scheduled and much more
methodical in keeping all of my plants
[SPEAKER_00]: tested for the presence of hoplatinviroid
maybe that is something you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: implement maybe you want to test your
plants randomly something I definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend is testing any incoming clones
and if you've seen any plants in your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: they look like they're like if you've got
ten plants and two of them are just kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of growing like shit now is the time to
get those tested and see if they have the
[SPEAKER_00]: virus because that virus will spread
through your grow rapidly we can talk a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more about that on a future episode
but it may be a good time to implement
[SPEAKER_00]: hoplatinviroid testing in your protocol
all right now so far in this podcast I
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like I've been talking about physical
changes we can make to our grow rooms to
[SPEAKER_00]: set ourselves up for success in 2024 let's
shift gears and talk more about planning
[SPEAKER_00]: and strategy that we can put into place to
set ourselves up for success in our grow
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms everything successful starts off
with a good plan and a solid goal so let's
[SPEAKER_00]: start by making plans and goals for our
grow room one of the first plans and goals
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put into place is how many
harvests do you want to pull from your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow this year I don't know how many
flowering rooms or flowering tents you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got I don't know how much veg space you've
got but think about how many harvests do
[SPEAKER_00]: you realistically want to pull from your
grow space this year we've got 365 days to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with if you've got a dedicated
flowering room and you put plants in there
[SPEAKER_00]: for 63 days which is nine weeks which most
plants are finished in about nine weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: you can probably pull 5.7 harvests from
that dedicated flowering room now that
[SPEAKER_00]: means there's no downtime there's not a
day of downtime there are no breaks can
[SPEAKER_00]: you make that happen can you get that 5.7
harvests from that room most people would
[SPEAKER_00]: be happy with five complete harvests from
one flowering room in a year I would be
[SPEAKER_00]: happy with that if you could get that 0.7
out of there and be halfway through a
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest at the end of the year that is a
big win but let's think about it now how
[SPEAKER_00]: many harvests do you want to pull from
that room do you have a dedicated veg
[SPEAKER_00]: space if you want 5.7 harvests from that
flower room you will need a dedicated veg
[SPEAKER_00]: space to where you can pull down a crop
move plants in the same day and keep going
[SPEAKER_00]: and then get that veg space active again
to where when we pull down that flower
[SPEAKER_00]: room the veg space goes right back in
there let's think about how many harvests
[SPEAKER_00]: we want to pull realistically you don't
have to do 5.7 per year this is up to you
[SPEAKER_00]: and now is the time to think about it if
you've only got one flowering room do you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do a perpetual cycle to where
you're taking down so many plants every
[SPEAKER_00]: two weeks every three weeks every 30 days
now is the time to start thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants and put them into place at
the start of the new year also I would
[SPEAKER_00]: think about how many plants are going to
go into that room or into each tent how
[SPEAKER_00]: often then start thinking about how many
mother plants do I need to supply clones
[SPEAKER_00]: for this many flowering rooms this often
then there's the other thing to think
[SPEAKER_00]: about are you going to run clones are you
going to run seeds now is a good time to
[SPEAKER_00]: really start thinking about strategy
realistically think it takes me this long
[SPEAKER_00]: to veg the plants as big as I want them
the plants I like to run take this long
[SPEAKER_00]: and flower how do I prepare to always have
plants in my flower room and always have
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in my veg room ready to fill those
spaces without overloading myself and
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly without going over your legal
numbers now is a good time to think about
[SPEAKER_00]: that and the new year is a great time to
start a new perpetual project also it may
[SPEAKER_00]: sound wild but now is a good time to start
thinking about your outdoor crop I know
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got five six maybe seven months
before we can put plants outdoors in many
[SPEAKER_00]: areas but it is never too early to start
thinking about that outdoor crop are you
[SPEAKER_00]: going to run seeds and put those outdoors
this year you could start seeds now in
[SPEAKER_00]: January you could veg them you can take a
clone from them you can either flower the
[SPEAKER_00]: clone or the veg plant you can sex the
plants this way find out if they're boys
[SPEAKER_00]: or girls you can run these plants one time
and see what is the keeper phenotype what
[SPEAKER_00]: would do best outside you can make that
selection and by March or April you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: have your decisions made of what should go
outside then when May or June comes around
[SPEAKER_00]: you've already got clones prepared then
you can veg those if you start now you may
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to veg some plants five six or
seven feet tall if you've got the ability
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors and put them out as monsters when
they go outside and that's how you achieve
[SPEAKER_00]: those big California monster plants that
we see on the internet all right so now is
[SPEAKER_00]: a good time to start thinking about that
outdoor crop that is coming up in six or
[SPEAKER_00]: seven months another huge way we can set
ourselves up for success in this year's
[SPEAKER_00]: grow is by reflecting on what we did last
year did you take notes on last year's
[SPEAKER_00]: growth if it was indoors if it was
outdoors if you've been growing for many
[SPEAKER_00]: years or just one year or maybe even just
one grow did you take notes what were you
[SPEAKER_00]: happy with what were you unsatisfied with
what did you do very well what do you not
[SPEAKER_00]: do very well are you taking notes do you
know where you can improve do you know
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're killing it do you know what
you can do better do you know where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: wasting money are you taking notes let's
take a minute to reflect on last year's
[SPEAKER_00]: grow and see how we can improve this
year's crop I think if we take a minute to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify what our weak point is in the
grow space then we can really improve upon
[SPEAKER_00]: that and then we can really step up our
entire game in the grow everybody's got
[SPEAKER_00]: one thing they're not good at in the grow
don't be ashamed don't feel embarrassed by
[SPEAKER_00]: it the thing to do is study that one thing
a lot of people are not good at taking
[SPEAKER_00]: clones I have got a very good clone SOP on
my discord if you join the discord I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: show you how to find that clone cutting
SOP many people find a great success using
[SPEAKER_00]: that clone SOP so if cloning isn't your
game reach out we can help you learn to
[SPEAKER_00]: become a better cloner if drying and
curing isn't your thing study drying and
[SPEAKER_00]: curing if you don't think you're good at
identifying a deficiency in a plant maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the area you need to do some
research in then by the end of the year
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll be the deficiency identification
expert you'll walk into a grow and you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: go that plant needs cow mag that plants
had too much phosphorus you're way giving
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant too much nitrogen why is it so
cold in here you'll become that guy just
[SPEAKER_00]: do a little bit of studying and pick up
the knowledge that you need in the area
[SPEAKER_00]: that you are lacking I will admit that the
area I could use the most improvement in
[SPEAKER_00]: is probably understanding lighting when it
comes to you moles poor jewel and all
[SPEAKER_00]: those colors and all those graphs
something in my brain doesn't give a shit
[SPEAKER_00]: to learn about that I care a lot about
photosynthesis I understand nutrients I
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the the breeding techniques I
understand a lot of the cycles and
[SPEAKER_00]: processes of the plant but when it comes
to understanding the lighting my brain
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't care to learn all of that stuff so
that's probably where I need to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: most improvement is learning about
lighting what's your weak area I admitted
[SPEAKER_00]: mine don't be embarrassed let's work on it
and get better at it together in 2024 I
[SPEAKER_00]: know everybody's got that one thing that
they need to work on but what else can you
[SPEAKER_00]: improve in the grow I'm sure there are a
few small details maybe you're not taking
[SPEAKER_00]: time to clean up after yourself like me
maybe you're not phing properly maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in a rush on one thing maybe you're
not paying attention to one detail let's
[SPEAKER_00]: take a minute and look at the grow and
look at our processes and see what we can
[SPEAKER_00]: improve on what are you doing in that grow
that is just habit what are you doing that
[SPEAKER_00]: is just ritual are the things you're doing
in your grow space in your and your
[SPEAKER_00]: standard operating procedure every day
when you go in there you check the room
[SPEAKER_00]: you look at the plants you do your thing I
don't know what you're doing in there we
[SPEAKER_00]: all have our own method to our madness in
there but in your standard operating
[SPEAKER_00]: procedure does everything make sense is
there a move in there that you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said that is just a ritual that is
just because do you know why you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that you're doing you might be
able to eliminate certain processes
[SPEAKER_00]: certain steps maybe even certain products
in your grow if you just take a step back
[SPEAKER_00]: and analyze what you're doing in there day
by day in your standard operating
[SPEAKER_00]: procedure maybe you're doing something
weird because you learned it from your
[SPEAKER_00]: hippie uncle who learned it from his
hippie uncle and nobody has any idea why
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing it you just heard that it
works pay attention check on that stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: see if it's some actual stuff or if it's
just habit or voodoo or a ritual that is
[SPEAKER_00]: making you feel good is it really doing
something let's also think about the money
[SPEAKER_00]: we're spending in there are we being
cost-effective in the grow or all the
[SPEAKER_00]: products you're buying providing some sort
of value to the grow are they adding some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of value to the outcome also think
about your time in there I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: about the time that I'm in my grow as
being hours on the clock or part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cost of growing that product because I
love being in there that's my zen space
[SPEAKER_00]: also it's been really cold and it's nice
and warm in the grow so if it's middle of
[SPEAKER_00]: the day and I've been out running errands
and I come home and I'm fucking freezing
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes I just go in the grow and
defoliate just to warm up I'll be in there
[SPEAKER_00]: just doing it but if you're a working
person who is using this grow as part of
[SPEAKER_00]: an income document your time in there see
where you can streamline your time if you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't be in there all day I've got the
freedom the ability the lifestyle to spend
[SPEAKER_00]: as much time as I really want to in my
grow with limits you know but many people
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have that luxury we've got families
jobs careers hobbies relationships all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the above to keep us busy so think about
the time that you're in there and see if
[SPEAKER_00]: you are making the most of your time in
that grow space like I said before if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got weird rituals or whatever maybe
we can eliminate those and focus and get
[SPEAKER_00]: in that grow and do what needs to be done
and get out and even make the grow more
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient by doing so now I did touch on
this part several times here in this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode one thing I definitely recommend
if if you are comfortable with this if you
[SPEAKER_00]: are in a legal state if you're in a
prohibition area do this part very
[SPEAKER_00]: carefully possibly if you choose to do
this but I like to keep a grow journal I
[SPEAKER_00]: keep a simple notepad in my phone I use
the notes app in my iPhone and I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: little notes that are headlined with each
grow space my grow rooms all have names in
[SPEAKER_00]: each grow room with each name I've got a
different list of notes that I've done in
[SPEAKER_00]: that room I just keep track of what I've
done hypothetically we'll say today that I
[SPEAKER_00]: fed that room 10 gallons of water then I'd
write down each nutrient that I put in
[SPEAKER_00]: that water I'd write down the pH of the
solution then I would write down the EC
[SPEAKER_00]: then I would water I'd probably write down
the temperature and humidity of the room
[SPEAKER_00]: too as I documented it as I was watering
just making random notes all of that shit
[SPEAKER_00]: is kept in my AC infinity little monitor
there but I wrote it down too so if I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to go look it's there in my notes what I
fed it the AC infinity didn't write down
[SPEAKER_00]: what I fed it I knew the temp and humidity
at a certain time I wrote down what I fed
[SPEAKER_00]: it I know it wrote down what time I fed it
what date so if I see a problem in a few
[SPEAKER_00]: days I can go well what did I feed it and
I can look back and I go oh I fucked up
[SPEAKER_00]: and gave it too much cal mag I gave it cal
mag two feedings in a row didn't need to
[SPEAKER_00]: do that I see the issue if I defoliate
I'll write down I defoliated the room
[SPEAKER_00]: really heavily or really lightly if I
notice something small presence of fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: gnats I'll write that sort of shit down
don't forget to buy this I also make
[SPEAKER_00]: myself notes like that but start a grow
journal write down definitely write down
[SPEAKER_00]: the day a clone was cut write down the day
a seed was germinated write down the day
[SPEAKER_00]: that that clone or seed went into dirt
write down the next day you transplanted
[SPEAKER_00]: that write down the day that it went into
flower write down the day that you change
[SPEAKER_00]: the timer if you make changes write that
down if I adjust my air conditioner up or
[SPEAKER_00]: down one or two degrees I write that down
if I change the humidifier the
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidifier I write that down everything
gets documented so that when I'm looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at the plants and I go what the fuck
happened I don't wonder what the fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: happened it's somewhere in the notes I
just got to read and say oh on this day I
[SPEAKER_00]: turned up the fucking air conditioner or I
turned down the dehumidifier and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything went to shit three days later
maybe this has something to do with it
[SPEAKER_00]: just save some sort of notes give yourself
some sort of journal set yourself up for
[SPEAKER_00]: success that way if you have problems you
can look back and see what you did wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: but also if you grow the best weed you've
ever grown you've already got the
[SPEAKER_00]: blueprint you can do it all over again
repeat everything you did in the last
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle so one thing I definitely recommend
is keeping a grow journal you can get many
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful great journals on Amazon if
you're the kind of person that writes
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff down you can get a plane notebook
paper notebook if you want you can get one
[SPEAKER_00]: of those moleskin journals you can just
use the iPhone you can use Google Docs
[SPEAKER_00]: however you want to do it however you feel
comfortable with in your environment like
[SPEAKER_00]: I said if you're in a prohibition state
those notes may be used against you in a
[SPEAKER_00]: court of law so be careful with that but
it's safe and legal here in Colorado we're
[SPEAKER_00]: actually required in a commercial grow
we're required to document all the
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides we apply we're required to
document default pollination weight we
[SPEAKER_00]: even have to document how much trash we
take out of the grow space so just get in
[SPEAKER_00]: the habit of documenting things it will be
good for you if if that is something
[SPEAKER_00]: you're comfortable with in your area all
right I feel like I've given you a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: tips and tricks and pointers to set
yourself up for success here in the new
[SPEAKER_00]: year in your grow space the most important
part ladies and gentlemen boys and girls
[SPEAKER_00]: is to have fun and enjoy growing don't
make it stressful don't make it burdensome
[SPEAKER_00]: don't make it a chore make sure you have
fun grow from your heart breed with love
[SPEAKER_00]: and have a good time in that grow space I
think your final product will reflect the
[SPEAKER_00]: the input that you did in that grow if
you're not there enough if you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: growing it just to grow it those plants
are gonna show you if you're in there
[SPEAKER_00]: every day giving them love giving them
attention taking care of them the way that
[SPEAKER_00]: they need it those plants are going to
show you so give those plants the love
[SPEAKER_00]: that they deserve give them the care that
they deserve if you're anxious nervous
[SPEAKER_00]: having a bad day maybe you got some road
rage from traffic maybe you're having a
[SPEAKER_00]: fight with your big brother maybe your
cousin stole your shoes I'm just making
[SPEAKER_00]: shit up if something went wrong and you're
not physically mentally spiritually right
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe don't go in there and stress spread
that stress to the plants unless going in
[SPEAKER_00]: there does give you that feeling of relief
my grow space is my zen space the air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioner and the blower is so loud in
there that I can't hear you if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking anyway I don't pay attention to
the phone very much when I'm in there so I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't hear shit I'm just zoned out
listening to the blowers listening to the
[SPEAKER_00]: fans watching the leaves rustle that is my
zen space so don't think about stressful
[SPEAKER_00]: negative shit when you're in the grow
space don't think about your wallet don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think about how much money this crop is
going to be worth when it's harvested
[SPEAKER_00]: don't think like that think about how good
people are going to feel when they consume
[SPEAKER_00]: this product that you put your time your
energy your love and your care into that
[SPEAKER_00]: is the rewarding part of growing good
ganja so like I said before grow from your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart and breed with love and put love and
care into your garden and it will reflect
[SPEAKER_00]: back at you you'll have a beautiful
harvest if you put that love and care into
[SPEAKER_00]: it ladies and gentlemen boys girls pimps
