[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, White Mike is back
on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you were a busy guy, but we get a
lot of requests to have you on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been hearing the shout outs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep sending them, people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll keep coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep requesting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: He will keep coming back on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have him for a long time,
so we're going to get into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's been a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's dive right in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's been a little while,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been chatting for a few,
so we got to jump into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about what we're smoking on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually, we talk about what we're smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just took a couple of dabs of GG number
four batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency label says it is 65% THC with
75.1% total cannabinoids, but I topped
[SPEAKER_00]: that off with some pre-98 Bubba Kush high
cannabinoid full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency label says this is 84.5% THC
and 96.7% total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, the batter looks ... Would you
agree that that kind of looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: cheesecake or cake batter?
[SPEAKER_00]: The lids are on the wrong packages,
so that one right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say cake batter or cheesecake,
and then this one- Put the lids on the
[SPEAKER_01]: right containers as they go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then this one over here, would you say it
looks like diamonds with hints of yellow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some batter with some diamonds in
it, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those dabs were delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: The GG four, we're not supposed to say the
other words, but the GG four tastes so
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trademark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that earthy, cushy sort of a
thing going on, and then that- The flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: on that combo dab was really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the pre-98 just punches you right in
the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those, of course, are from
Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends at Apothecary
Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do good work.

[SPEAKER_00]: here, and they see me on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have become quite friendly,
so a big shout out to all my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go take care of your bud tenders at

[SPEAKER_00]: .patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we do have a couple of things
to talk about on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to the main topic of the
show, I do need to make a correction.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a corrections department.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the person who sent me
the message, reminding me that I fucked
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said something wrong on the podcast,
and I'm all about being corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes people are going to make
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did 440 episodes, and I think this is
the second or third correction I've
[SPEAKER_00]: received.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is the fourth, I'm going to say
that's still good percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I'm going to make some mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize when that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do my best to stay on top of it,
but occasionally I talk fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brain goes really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they don't connect properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the wrong numbers and letters
will fly out, but I said something that
[SPEAKER_00]: was inaccurate, and our corrections
department sent me a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do that again, please feel free,
send me messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like being corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we stay smart and on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: The correction I need to make is,
on the last episode, I said that I only
[SPEAKER_00]: use products in a growth flow that are on
the Colorado Department of Agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: approved pesticide list for cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I listed Asimax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Asimax has been banned in the use of
cannabis in Colorado medical and
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational production.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I said that, I was absolutely wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am correcting myself now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not use Asimax.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will get yourself in some trouble with
the Department of Ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stand corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for that misinformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do my best not to do that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise you I'm not spraying Asimax
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't think of it off the top of my
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have looked that up, but that's
not what I was here for today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to make sure that I did
correct you, that Asimax, or correct
[SPEAKER_00]: myself, that Asimax is no longer allowed
in cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've made that correction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move forward, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ready to jump into the main topic of
today's podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big news today, Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: Illinois has gone recreational legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now in Illinois, you can possess,
I don't know all of the rules,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you can have your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not until January 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to wait until the rules come into
play.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always the fun part.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bill was signed into law today.
[SPEAKER_02]: It landed on the governor's desk a couple
of weeks ago and has been in that fun
[SPEAKER_02]: limbo while the governor decides or
decides not to or waits for the time they
[SPEAKER_02]: feel like signing to occur.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today was that day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It got signed this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for signing it, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whose name I am not aware of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Governor hard to say his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Governor hard to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe rude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I don't know what his name is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it feels like when you say that the
bill has been, that we've basically been
[SPEAKER_00]: waiting for him to sign it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the feeling of like when there's a
movie coming out or a toy coming out when
[SPEAKER_00]: you were a kid and you wanted to go to
that movie or you wanted that toy and you
[SPEAKER_00]: were just asking your mom, Hey,
Friday, when this toy comes out,
[SPEAKER_00]: can I get it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I get it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I get it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And all week she's like, I don't know,
because she really didn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: She knows she can make that shit happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Friday when payday came, she's going to
pay up all the bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there was six bucks, left to go to
that movie, you could, but she didn't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to tell you yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause she'd break your fucking heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: She didn't want to tell you no now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause she might break your fucking heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she'd be like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all week you're just waiting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's a bizarre political thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this is something that the governor
in question, the governor of Illinois said
[SPEAKER_02]: he wanted, it was part of his campaign for
reelection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting it done this year was a big
platform of his, something he talked about
[SPEAKER_02]: wanting to accomplish legalization
efforts, especially in the legislatures
[SPEAKER_02]: this year took a weird turn where instead
of just getting cannabis legal,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're trying to write like a whole bunch
of the wrongs that have occurred over the
[SPEAKER_02]: prohibition years at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just too much at once.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we want one stop shopping here where
we get weed legal and we get funding for
[SPEAKER_02]: communities that were way over policed for
drug crimes and have suffered systemic
[SPEAKER_02]: problems because of that over policing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to get them some funding
and we're going to make sure that there's
[SPEAKER_02]: a fund for minority business owners to
become marijuana business owners to help
[SPEAKER_02]: them out with credit and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to, if you sent that to me
in an email, you know what I would reply
[SPEAKER_02]: with too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't read.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's yeah, it's, it's four or five
different ideas almost together.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also got, um, fixing past
convictions.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were convicted of possession or
less than, I want to say it's 30 grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember thinking it was an out,
ounce and change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if you had less than an ounce of
change and you were busted in Illinois,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can now apply to have, uh,
that conviction, uh, sealed or removed
[SPEAKER_02]: from your record.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure how they word it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that they gave you 30 grams in case
you got it from me and I gave you a fat
[SPEAKER_00]: ounce, you know, you can have an extra 30,
31, 32 and not get in trouble because I
[SPEAKER_00]: never gave you 28.35.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I mentioned that before,
28.35 an ounce is not 28 grams and ounces,
[SPEAKER_00]: 28, 0.35 that, that only, that doesn't
sound big.
[SPEAKER_02]: That point is a little surprised.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rest of the world is like fucking
America, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when that 0.35 doesn't sound like
much, but add it up to four times.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're buying a quarter pound,
now you're at 0.7.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 1.4, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then do the 16, then do that eight times
and do it 16 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what if you're buying 10 pounds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like those people aren't, but we've got,
yeah, that's what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a legal medical marijuana
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if I say I sold them 10 pounds and you
only ring up that 10 pounds by 28 grams
[SPEAKER_00]: and you actually gave, I gave them 28.35,
there's going to be a shortage somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: on our system and in our money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a way on a fucking crazy rant there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 30 grams bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the 30 grams thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like all of the parts that they kind of
squeezed into this law, but we watched New
[SPEAKER_02]: York and New Jersey fail in their attempts
to get legalization done this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not because like a whole bunch of people
there were like, maybe it's a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hold off and see how it goes in the
other place.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were all like, well, I want money for
this pet project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I think it's important that
we address this particular wrong with this
[SPEAKER_02]: bill and they could never hash out the
taxes and the other stuff they wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: attach to legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they left it illegal for another eight
months or in Texas for two more years
[SPEAKER_02]: because the legislature only meets every
other year.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Illinois managed to squeak it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just barely to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think when this bill went through the
Senate and their house of representatives,
[SPEAKER_02]: it only had a couple of days left in their
official session.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it made it through just under the wire.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then governors do this weird thing
where they campaign on something.
[SPEAKER_02]: The house passes it, the Senate passes it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes to the governor's desk and then
there's just three weeks wondering what
[SPEAKER_02]: the fuck's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do they play with us like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not any rhyme or reason to it
because all the governors do it and it
[SPEAKER_02]: happens pretty much anytime there's a bill
signing, the bill heads to the governor's
[SPEAKER_02]: desk and you would expect like,
Hey, this is a big thing you've been
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking talking about for a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a big fight over it,
the press and you won.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you official one on Friday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is Monday not like the everybody get
together in my office and we'll sign this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always a couple of weeks down the
road and then they don't announce it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been waiting for the official
like, Hey, Illinois got signed to call you
[SPEAKER_02]: and say, Hey, we have to do a show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should talk about Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect timing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been watching.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been no announcement saying,
Hey, we're going to sign that sucker on
[SPEAKER_02]: Wednesday or nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just, I got up today and I looked at my
phone and was like, Oh, Hey, he signed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't pay attention to much of their
stuff going on in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we are in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not no offense to Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just pay more attention to Colorado
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if he's just been going through a
list signing shit or if today was just the
[SPEAKER_00]: day he's like, Oh, I should get on that
list of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was working on a to-do list and this
was just item 25 and he couldn't get to it
[SPEAKER_02]: until he got item 24 done is there's
nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strange, strange either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to our friends out there in
Illinois for joining the recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis game.
[SPEAKER_02]: January 1st, everything really kicks off.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in Illinois or want to start a
marijuana business in Illinois,
[SPEAKER_02]: now's the time to get on that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That brings us to 11 recreational cannabis
States here in the great United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're from Pueblo, that's 11,
but most of the world says 11.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Colorado gets to claim to be first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Washington gets to claim that they went at
the same time as us, their polls just
[SPEAKER_02]: closed two hours after ours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then every state census tried to come
up with their own little claim to fame.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Vermont got to say like we legalized
adult possession, but through the
[SPEAKER_02]: legislature were the first state to do it
through the legislature, but they haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: gotten around to creating a commercial
industry system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Illinois's went through the
legislature.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were the second to do through the
legislature.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're the first to do it through the
legislature and include a retail system
[SPEAKER_02]: like framework for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're like, Hey, we're first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like 11th bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to jump up and say that
Colorado was not first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, he said recreational wreck.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to medical, there are other
States that were first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big, big shout out to our friends to
Callie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that is a good segue.
[SPEAKER_00]: 33 medical marijuana States here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys can do math, 33 now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That only leaves out six States without
some cannabis friendly laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike and I were trying to do some
research, honestly, at the start of the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we kept finding conflicting
information on which States do not support
[SPEAKER_00]: medical or some sort of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many States at this point, I think,
I really think it's under five that don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have any sort of marijuana law,
but now there's at least four or five on
[SPEAKER_02]: top of that original five that are CBD
only where you can get basically hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: extract that up until the farm bill passed
in November would have been considered
[SPEAKER_02]: totally illegal part of the marijuana
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: No different in a court of law from high
THC hash, but you can get CBD extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's like, Utah and a couple
of others that are really minimal CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: only.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at a map and it had different
shades of green would indicate
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational legal or decriminalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then little black States on the map
would indicate don't go here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of those were down in the
southeastern part of our great nation
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was, that's where we need to kind
of shift our focus on the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us seem to be catching on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in, it's coming in quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wisconsin, Wisconsin is one of the States
that has no medical marijuana laws,
[SPEAKER_02]: no recreational marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today they're elected officials.
[SPEAKER_02]: Several of them were in the press talking
about like, well, you know, now we're kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of boxed in with Illinois going.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is, is Illinois is another big state.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a shit ton of people that live in
Illinois.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to Google exactly what their
population is, but that seems like extra
[SPEAKER_02]: effort for tonight's show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think, thanks Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that, uh, state officials,
people that decision makers on that level
[SPEAKER_00]: think like I do when they see,
so I'm just going to say they were a
[SPEAKER_00]: square and the States to the North,
the South, the East and the West of us
[SPEAKER_00]: have all hypothetically just legalized
some sort of cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that that makes us go,
well, from an economic standpoint,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to do this too, because all of our
people are just driving 30 miles that way,
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 miles that way, or 30 miles that way,
or 110 miles that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're buying product there and
bringing it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we need to just start.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that works?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know for a fact, there are sections of
Colorado that were thrilled that,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, a couple of our neighboring States
failed at their legalization attempts,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, because areas like Trinidad and
Southern Colorado have been, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: really energized by legal cannabis taxes
and revenue, um, investment in the
[SPEAKER_02]: community.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Trinidad's a weird city.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's gone through several boom and bus
cycles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and even like their sheriff is like,
Hey, ride the boom while it's booming.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys aren't hurting anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're investing a ton of taxes into our
little area.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have friends down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to go to gatherings down there and
we've seen that place go from a dusty kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of a falling apart town.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was almost a ghost town.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was now it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's strange to say, but it was five
or 10 years from ghost town.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and now it's a hustling little city
and Trinidad is basically the first city
[SPEAKER_00]: in Colorado when you come from New Mexico,
if you're coming North from New Mexico,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a good segue to talk about this
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I stay a lot on top of what's
happening in New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm involved in the New Mexico medical
marijuana movement is also, and also what
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to become the recreational
medical marijuana movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do, uh, some consulting and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I help people down there, uh, do some
teaching and other things, but I pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to what's going on down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big part of why they are pushing toward
the legalization of recreational cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: is because they see many people post
openly about it on Facebook in the,
[SPEAKER_00]: in anywhere in the groups on the,
wherever we talk on social media,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like, I don't even shop in New
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to Colorado because it's half the
price.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're showing pictures of all
this Colorado product in New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so New Mexico is saying, well,
they're just driving two hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all they have to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's half the price and double the
quality because we have silly rules here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's change that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's actually part of why they're
changing the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a small influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say it's a big deal, but it does
affect them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've noticed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a huge influx of, they call it
tourism traffic through Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, starting January 2014, as soon as our
rec stores open, um, there was no reason
[SPEAKER_02]: to come visit us with med stores really.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean you could, but you weren't,
who wants to go stay in a parking lot at
[SPEAKER_02]: Disneyland or Wally world or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, with rec people from all around
the U S I mean all over the planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I, when I was budtending it,
one of the more touristy spots in town,
[SPEAKER_02]: like we would get people from all over the
planet regularly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you can remember a couple of guys from
Ireland who spent like an hour walking
[SPEAKER_02]: around and taking pictures of,
I mean, everything in the dispenser is
[SPEAKER_02]: just blown away because there's nothing
like this where they're from.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to be for another 30 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep watching us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada saw some of our States going,
going legal and that really pushed their
[SPEAKER_02]: government.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I mean really, really pushed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been more adult about their
marijuana discussion, I'd say for the last
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 years, but watching States in,
in the U S go legal and then having
[SPEAKER_02]: Canadians report, like we just jumped the
border to Washington, grab what we want
[SPEAKER_02]: and bring it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one checks our cars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like who smoke a shit from the U S into
Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, um, Canada jumped on us.
[SPEAKER_02]: On it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mexico's talking about it right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when Mexico goes legal, that's huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's gonna change the game
completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the feds here haven't made a move on
legalization when Mexico goes,
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll cause, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll cause all kinds of weird,
probably all kinds of international rule
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's all kinds of shit that's legal
in Mexico and Canada that ain't legal
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, like cigars for one thing from Cuba.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those may, if I heard correctly,
we lifted that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what's happened in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't pay enough attention to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did give me a good opportunity for a
good segue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to throw it out before I forget it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about the 11 rec States,
the 33 medical marijuana States.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of talk some trash about those
punk ass States that haven't caught on
[SPEAKER_00]: yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boys and girls, let's get some,
some cannabis friendly happening in your
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you, do you know of any places
where would be in your opinion,
[SPEAKER_00]: the worst cannabis laws and they don't
have to be in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where would you not want to be caught with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a bunch of places in like Asia
where I remember reading a story dude had,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, a little bit of a nug like that fell
off his lap.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was rolling a joint, like something
that fell out of the end of the joint and
[SPEAKER_02]: got stuck in his shoe and was doing time
in like Egypt for it or some shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause he got caught at the airport.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, US, um, Texas has always had
particularly horrible marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, especially in regards to concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you got caught with hash,
they would charge you as though it was
[SPEAKER_02]: heroin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have, I have a, an acquaintance who was
caught with one of these containers in
[SPEAKER_00]: Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this container I'm picking up container
inside is a gram container.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you, I'm going to drop this
container on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to turn the mic toward the table
and then I'm going to drop this on the
[SPEAKER_00]: table so you can hear how much this
container weighs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a heavy glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a lot of weight to that glass
jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they busted him in Texas,
you know what they did?
[SPEAKER_00]: They charged him for the weight of the
container he had.
[SPEAKER_00]: So however much you just heard to hit the
table, they think he had that much
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate on him when he had less than a
gram, because honestly he'd been consuming
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was probably three quarters,
maybe a half note on this dude by the time
[SPEAKER_00]: he got to Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, they charged him with that full
weight of that container.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a case that I'm, I'm pretty sure
I mentioned it on the, on the show at the
[SPEAKER_02]: time where a dude bought two grams of
shatters.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just two grams of hash and baked each
gram into a tray of brownies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he had two trays of brownies.
[SPEAKER_02]: They weighed the tray that the brownies
were in and the brownies and then charged
[SPEAKER_02]: this kid in court is though he had that
weight worth of heroin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this kid was looking at like 40
years in prison for making two trays of
[SPEAKER_02]: brownies because he used hash to make
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they weigh, everything is they
could have, they could have charged him
[SPEAKER_02]: with two grams of marijuana concentrate,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But under Texas law, they get to weigh the
fucking brownies.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get to weigh the container the
brownies are in and then they get to call
[SPEAKER_02]: it heroin at your trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had a hard narcotic, a schedule one
narcotic schedule.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeez.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's miserable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Utah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I hate on like a number of principles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sorry if you, you're a Utah lover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice I haven't thrown out any hatred for
any places.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, trying to travel Utah's, um,
marijuana laws have always been
[SPEAKER_02]: exceptionally harsh.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is Oklahoma's.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I remember Macaulay Culkin got
Oklahoma with like a quarter and they were
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about sending Macaulay Culkin to
jail for like several years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got a nice medical program going
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Oklahoma is kind of like the new
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are trying to start a cannabis
business, if you're got something going
[SPEAKER_00]: on, if you got commercial grow experience,
you're hot in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now that is a place to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there are stories from, I'm from,
I've got some background in the music
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to try to sound like some
fucking music guru or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I've done some stuff in the music
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse that throat stuff there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll fix that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done some stuff in the music
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you travel out of the States,
one of the things that comes in this
[SPEAKER_00]: little pamphlet that a lot of the record
companies and touring companies will give
[SPEAKER_00]: you says that they recommend you buy new
shoes and new clothing before you travel
[SPEAKER_00]: to places like Dubai and Egypt and like
any where in Asia or the middle East
[SPEAKER_00]: because they scan you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they find they say not to wear,
they say to go to the airport in one pair
[SPEAKER_00]: of shoes and carry another pair of shoes
in the box and never wear them and ditch
[SPEAKER_00]: those before you get on the plane and then
put on your new or ditch the old ones as
[SPEAKER_00]: you get on the plane and put on your new
shoes and fly in those and travel into the
[SPEAKER_00]: country in your new shoes because they'll
scan your shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've got, if you've walked
through something with drugs on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will detect that I'm doing air
quotes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, there's at least one Asian
country where they're regularly executing,
[SPEAKER_02]: like beheading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like co-weight will be drug traffickers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's anybody caught with more than a
tiny amount of drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing the same shit they used to
do here, where if you go buy a quarter
[SPEAKER_02]: ounce of weed, your guy throws you two
bags that are 3.5 grams each.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't, you didn't just buy a quarter
according to law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have seven grams ready for
distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a gram of pre-98 Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a gram of GG four.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a gram of star cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to list names here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying that I've got multiple
grams, but since I chose to buy multiple
[SPEAKER_02]: flavors, because it's not all mushed
together in the bottom of a jar or a
[SPEAKER_02]: baggie, it's ready for distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are different flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, I heard a cop say they think that
all these different plants do different
[SPEAKER_00]: things to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all just makes them stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've heard a cop say that and I was
like, geez, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good support officer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, the level of ignorance around
cannabis and why it's so effective on so
[SPEAKER_02]: many different things is just astounding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, we're, we're fixing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing our part to fix that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just getting all the bullshit one,
one episode at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for helping us do that,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing your part out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't given you a shout out on your
social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like people to follow your
Facebook page?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can check me out on Twitter at at
NemoPunk15 or on Facebook at Pueblo for
[SPEAKER_02]: sensible cannabis laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give Mike a follow cause he is a cannabis
advocate, a spokesperson and a warrior.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to give them some support.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give them some clicks and follows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know you found them on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had always, it's nice to know where
your clicks and follows are coming from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been inspired to write much
lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hit me up, send me some social media love
and maybe I'll get writing again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trigger him, get him going.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started to felt less like arguing and it
kind of felt like I was the dude clubbing
[SPEAKER_02]: baby seals to death for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, they needed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The average intelligence on the internet
is not impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you go in, if you've done two
minutes of research, you already look
[SPEAKER_00]: smarter than 99.9% percent of the people
in opposition of your idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's mostly an echo chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go in and you break up the echo
chamber, you already look like you're
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking some sort of elite something
already.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it, uh, there's the anti pot crowds
fucking bad at everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I, the first three paragraphs of
my response are correcting words they've
[SPEAKER_02]: used majorly incorrectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, no, you didn't mean school
bus, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: You meant sneakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there are only six states left.
[SPEAKER_02]: So obviously it just feels like you're
punching down when you got to start off
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I took a little break.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've slowed down on my social media and my
social media trolling and it does make a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys put down the computer and the phone
and that's coming from a guy who is
[SPEAKER_02]: constantly 11 screens pointed at Jeff
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but we're running a show here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's got show notes, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's for you so that you know where
the hell we're going.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's making the show happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without these, man, it's, it's dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indubitably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to use that word more often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Mike, thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let's start wrapping up this podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we should.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels like the right time to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, make sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations Illinois before we,
uh, before we move to the outro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to governor hard to say and
all of our friends out there in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I could Google his name for a
minute, but it's got some weird letters
[SPEAKER_02]: mashed together in the front and I'm bad
at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I bet only the people from Illinois
care what his name is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that's 80% of them are going,
yeah, hard to say it's good enough for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Governor hard to say, but we really
appreciate the marijuana legalization
[SPEAKER_02]: effort this month or this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Illinois is we needed that win.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so good on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
