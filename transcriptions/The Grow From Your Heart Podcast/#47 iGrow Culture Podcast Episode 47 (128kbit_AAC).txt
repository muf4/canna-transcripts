[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, what's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for another episode of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, I made the switch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is now the official Grow From Your
Heart podcast, your source for cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: news, education, and conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to episode number 47.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Rasta Jeff, and I'm coming
to you again with another solo episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today is Saturday.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Saturday after the new year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the first Saturday of the new year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope everybody had a great, safe,
joyous new year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a few people to thank and a few
things to talk about, but before we get
[SPEAKER_01]: that far,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's pay a couple of bills.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get started.
[SPEAKER_01]: While you can, big thanks and much respect
to Nature's Green Remedies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hygro is always running a special for the
podcast listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you check out, tell them you listen
to the Hygro Culture podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's going to get confusing
because now you have to say you listen to
[SPEAKER_01]: the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
but let those guys know you listen to the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast and they will give you commercial
pricing on your entire order.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much respect to Hygro, Indoor Growing
Supplies, the Denver and Pueblo location.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a sweet hookup for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse and I have been talking a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse's been kind of a busy dude,
but we are working on putting together
[SPEAKER_01]: some prizes for episode 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to hang out in a day or two
and that's going to be our priority of the
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse my sniffles.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk a little bit about my sniffles
here in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw the string cheese incident for three
nights in Denver, and I may have gotten a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit sniffly during that minus 16
night.
[SPEAKER_01]: This podcast is also brought to you by our
good friends at treethugger.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode is brought to you,
I just read that part, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Treethugger.com, live music lifestyle
magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out treethugger.com for concert and
festival, news and reviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look out at the cookout with treethugger
.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all the ads we're going to do
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out, much love to both or all
three of the sponsors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm high and stumbling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to get my rhythm in this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to give a big shout out to the
Mystic Roots band.
[SPEAKER_01]: The song you heard at the opening of the
show was called the Doggy Dub from our
[SPEAKER_01]: good friends, the Mystic Roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Kat and Coot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you guys had a great new year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope everybody had a great new year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking about going to see the
string cheese incident.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll talk about that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to go see, if you don't know about
the string cheese, they're a jam band from
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're from the Boulder Estes Park.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're from all over the place up there,
so you can't pick one place to stay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's where they're from,
is that kind of area.
[SPEAKER_01]: They started off as kind of a blue grassy
jam band.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they're kind of more of a psychedelic
dubstep jam band.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got two drummers, or they've got a
drummer and a guy that plays percussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a keyboard player that tears
it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got an electric guitar player who
plays fiddle and electric guitar and
[SPEAKER_01]: mandolin like a champ.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bill Nershe plays acoustic guitar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then their bass player is,
he's solid, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't like to stand out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not super flashy, but he never missed
a note in three nights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the string cheese incident,
they play, the only way I can describe it,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude, is carnival music.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's calypso music.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mambo music.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's samba.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's reggae.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like one giant carnival.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole party, the whole concert was one
giant carnival.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we saw string cheese incident.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did three nights at the First Bank
Center in Broomfield.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we drove up to, it was actually in
Westminster is where our hotel was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we drove up to the hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: We stayed in the hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went and saw the first show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after the first set, they do three
nights and the first night they played for
[SPEAKER_01]: about an hour and 15, took a break,
and then came out for about another hour
[SPEAKER_01]: and a half and tore that night up.
[SPEAKER_01]: After the first set of the first night,
I said, where are they going to go from
[SPEAKER_01]: here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they came out and they just tore
it up right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't start like, let's start slow
and build it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they started like, let's come out on
fire and just fuck this all up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big thanks to the string cheese
incident.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So day two, or we finished the show night
one way, went back to the hotel,
[SPEAKER_01]: we were beat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We pretty much slept.
[SPEAKER_01]: Day two, we kind of just hung out in the
hotel and we're lazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was minus 16 degrees that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was no real reason to leave the
hotel other than to get food.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had dabs and drinks and everything we
needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just hung out in the hotel until
time for the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second night was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We pretty much, we ditched the shows at
the end and head right back to the hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not real party animals anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need to eat a bunch of drugs and
get spun out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to go home and get prepared for
the next day because New Year's was a big
[SPEAKER_01]: party.
[SPEAKER_01]: They started a little bit early and they
played until about 1.45, if I remember
[SPEAKER_01]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They started at 8.45 and went till 1.45
with a couple of breaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: String cheese incident on New Year's,
I've never seen so much confetti,
[SPEAKER_01]: so many balloons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even begin to describe what it was
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me and my girlfriend, Angela, were in the
front three rows right in front of Bill
[SPEAKER_01]: Nershy and kind of off to the side from
Kyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a huge party right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after the first or second night,
everybody knew who we were.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone just treated us like friends
and family.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out to all the new friends
and family that I made from the string
[SPEAKER_01]: cheese incident.
[SPEAKER_01]: But man, they had these giant,
they looked like cocoons hanging from the
[SPEAKER_01]: ceiling when we walked in that night and
you couldn't identify what they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as the midnight countdown began,
these cocoons opened up and they became
[SPEAKER_01]: giant flowers that were lit up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I posted video on my Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys want to check that out,
you'll have to find my personal Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: I shouldn't have said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are a lot of cool videos of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was covered in confetti.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were so many balloons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big thanks to Angela for letting me go,
inviting me to be your New Year's buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also for, thanks for that sweet New
Year's kiss, babe.
[SPEAKER_01]: We needed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It meant a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks to all the cheese kids and fans
that I made.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made a list here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to get some of these
people in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to skip a bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big thanks to Pam and Jessica.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met Pam for the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Angela speaks very highly of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I see why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jessica, I just met that night and had
never heard of her.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a big ball of smiley energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great to meet you and hang out with
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks to Mama Cass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great meeting you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice lady that calls herself Mama Cass.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had a lot of great energy,
had a lot of good things to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks to the guy with the amazing
candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot remember your name.
[SPEAKER_01]: This dude next to me offered me a lemon,
excuse me, he offered me a lemon candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, is it just candy?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, yeah, man, my thing is to
just bring weird candies to the show and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I took this lemon candy from him
and it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And later on in the show, he offered me
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when he pulled it out of his pocket,
the guy next to him patted me on the
[SPEAKER_01]: shoulder and said, eat one of those,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I tried it, it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was some, all the packaging was in
another language.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like Chinese or Korean or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry if that's offensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what fucking language it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks Chinese to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was mango flavored and whatever I
ate was amazing, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it did not have drugs in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was pretty relieved about an hour
later when I wasn't flipping my face off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a big shout out to the candy guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also a big shout out to Dan, Karen,
Roland, and Riley.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a pleasure meeting all of my new
friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great little family you guys have there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also a shout out to the girl that we named
Titty Girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never met her.
[SPEAKER_01]: We never met her, but her boobs and her
vibes were amazing and fun to watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was so exposed that my girlfriend told
me to look because it was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: She said, look to your left, that girl's
boobs are out of her shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I looked and it was, it wasn't even
like I was looking to be a perv.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was more looking like, is she really
having her tits out of her shirt?
[SPEAKER_01]: That much at the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of entertaining, kind of
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a big shout out to Titty Girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was a good dancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had a lot of good energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: She brought a little crew of chicks with
her that twirled around and brought a nice
[SPEAKER_01]: little vibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, some of the girls at the show,
they wear this eye makeup with beads in
[SPEAKER_01]: it, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't understand how you ladies do
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got like, I'm serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like right in the corner of your eye where
you wake up with eye crusties on the
[SPEAKER_01]: outside, not near your nose, but the other
side, they've got little beads and shit
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand how ladies tolerate
that shit all night on your face.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do however think it's cute and I
totally appreciate the effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does make me be extra glad to be
the guy with dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wake up, sometimes I take a shower
occasionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mostly wake up, put on some clothes,
throw on a t-shirt, shake my head and put
[SPEAKER_01]: on a hat and I'm ready to rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't tell if I just woke up or if
I've been working all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes me extra grateful to be a guy
that can be lazy, but also thank you
[SPEAKER_01]: ladies for looking great at the cheese
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Angela, thank you for looking wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again for letting me have a good
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did mention I got a little cold,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some sniffles, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just sniffled right into the mic to do
that and that was rude.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was minus 16 degrees one night and
you got to go from the car into the
[SPEAKER_01]: concert venue in the minus 16.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in the concert, I took off all my
jackets and I had my t-shirt and my pants
[SPEAKER_01]: on and my shoes and my hat and I was
sweating my ass off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got to try to negotiate the cold
and then the super hot heat and then back
[SPEAKER_01]: to the car again and then let the car warm
up and get to the hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think all the climate changes,
I may have got a little cold here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also I smoked like 45 joints over
three nights at these concerts where I
[SPEAKER_01]: rolled a bunch of joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoked like 45 joints with strangers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm wondering if maybe I got a little
bit of string cheese incident,
[SPEAKER_01]: Wook Flu, but whatever, I'll live.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some emergency and some Yerba Mate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fun meeting a lot of Instagram
followers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They walked up to me and they said,
Hey, are you Irie Genetics or are you
[SPEAKER_01]: Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's always kind of nice when you're
just out randomly somewhere that there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: band playing and you're not like,
it wasn't a weed event.
[SPEAKER_01]: I shouldn't have been getting any
attention, but people knew who I was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out to all those folks that
said hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm digging through notes here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, huge shout out to Aaron Brooks.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the very last night we were walking out
of the venue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if my girlfriend didn't have to pee,
we would not have bumped into each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm so glad she had to pee and I bumped
into Aaron Brooks and got a big old hug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aaron Brooks is an artist.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not following him, you should
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else do I need to talk about?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote down a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm rambling.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're already 11 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And guys, this is going to be another one
of those short, quick episodes with just
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put a lot of work into this podcast,
but this week I was obviously busy seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: the string cheese incident.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been out of town.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was gone for four days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took me a whole day to get my gardens
back to where I felt they should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: They missed me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I needed a day to get myself back
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to record yesterday, but it was
chaotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm recording this quick short episode
because I love you guys and I don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to leave you hanging for a whole week.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do promise that the next episodes
are going to be back to what you expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: 48, 49, and 50 are going to be stellar
episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping to get Spencer on pretty soon,
but I never teased you about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I'm choking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a quick drink here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a dab while I take a drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, shout out to water and root beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those things keep me alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So remind you guys of the name change.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my next note.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you noticed at the beginning of
the show that I said welcome to the
[SPEAKER_01]: iGrowCulture podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing my best to roll out the new
name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing it slowly so I don't lose
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it looks confusing for a little bit,
I'm sure you guys are aware of what's
[SPEAKER_01]: going on if you're listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are in the process of changing the
name from iGrowCulture to Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_01]: Heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bear with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still could use more logos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody sent me one logo, but I asked for
a couple of adjustments.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just didn't fit the way I needed it to
fit to make squares out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need a square logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can send me a 1400 by 1400 pixel
image with the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast, I would love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also need a song.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody out there is an artist and you
want to make a Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast theme song, I will compensate you
in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm starting to change the title in
social media places also.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm waiting on a couple artists to submit
some logos that I've commissioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once I've got all the artwork,
I can fully roll out the new title and
[SPEAKER_01]: start switching everything over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping by episode 50 that we can
actually just call this the Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_01]: Heart podcast and everything will be
switched right over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, here's something that I've been
considering.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a personal thing for myself
that I'm considering doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may cancel the Instagram for the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is an iGrowCulture podcast Instagram
that I haven't posted anything to in
[SPEAKER_01]: several weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, it's just a distraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of my guests don't want me to
take their picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse doesn't want his face on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adam is cool with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike is cool with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some people do not want to be seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like I'm just going to overdo
my Instagram presence by having the
[SPEAKER_01]: iRegenetics and the iGrowCulture or the
Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm thinking about just combining the
two into one entity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe I'll start posting a few things
from the Grow From Your Heart podcast on
[SPEAKER_01]: the iRegenetics Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're not already following
iRegenetics on Instagram, go there and
[SPEAKER_01]: follow that because I'm really considering
taking down the Instagram for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a distraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one more thing to worry about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also considering, and I'm not
committing to this, but it's highly likely
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody had a talk with me and it got me
thinking, but I'm considering canceling my
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube account for the iGrowCulture Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd say, why would you do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: People are listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are, but not as many.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I appreciate the people that are
listening, but it takes me a long time to
[SPEAKER_01]: get those episodes up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel if I cancel that, I feel I can
focus more on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I didn't have to create as many
different types of media, I could make
[SPEAKER_01]: better content just for the audio podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather spend the time creating content
instead of editing video and setting up a
[SPEAKER_01]: camera and lighting and editing the video
again and then rendering the video for
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a few more steps, but all of
those steps matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could spend that much time preparing for
this show and making the show that much
[SPEAKER_01]: better, having that many more details,
being that much more prepared,
[SPEAKER_01]: getting that much better of a guest on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Instagram and the YouTube may go
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just personal things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to free up more time to take
what I'm really passionate about to the
[SPEAKER_01]: next level.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to drag my feet on things
that are not fulfilling me, honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I may eliminate those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do appreciate the guys that watch me
on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only gotten like 17 or 18,
maybe 20 videos up on YouTube because like
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, it takes me an hour to make each
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like I could, I'm repeating
myself, I could just spend that time doing
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I may take them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to abandon people,
but if you are watching on YouTube,
[SPEAKER_01]: you should be able to find it on the iGrow
Culture or the iRead Genetics website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every podcast is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you've got a browser, it works the
same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're not missing anything visually,
really.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are mostly distractions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm going to stop contributing
to those just so that I can improve the
[SPEAKER_01]: audio part of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like I'm talking about that for
a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate all the emails I've gotten.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy crap, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to continue to use the
iGrowCulture at hotmail.com email address
[SPEAKER_01]: for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: By episode 50, I will have created the new
email address and I'll start talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can email me there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from now on, or for now, keep using
the iGrowCulture at hotmail.com email
[SPEAKER_01]: address.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did change the Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still at iGrowCulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you look at it, the name is Grow
From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't let me change my at name,
only my display name.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something you can pay attention
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote a bunch of notes and I have them
in my computer and I'm scrolling through
[SPEAKER_01]: the computer and looking at a piece of
paper, trying to read two things at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's honestly not working.
[SPEAKER_01]: So episode 50 is coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have been talking about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm planning a small celebration episode,
but I would like your input.
[SPEAKER_01]: I asked for this on the last episode,
but I want to know who your favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: guests were.
[SPEAKER_01]: What were some of your favorite moments
and what did you learn and what would you
[SPEAKER_01]: like to hear next?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said, send me some input.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's iGrowCulture at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tweet me or you can find me on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like I need to change the
Facebook also, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's still iGrowCulture, but pretty
soon it's going to be the Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_01]: Heart Podcast on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I got you guys caught up on
all of the stuff I had to remind you of
[SPEAKER_01]: and talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I think it's time to read a couple
of news articles that I picked out for the
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one says Colorado seeks federal okay
for state colleges to grow pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people from out of state are
going, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it'll make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: This article is from the Denver Post.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's written by John Engold.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, Colorado has made an unusual plea
to federal authorities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let our colleges grow pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a letter sent last month, the state
attorney general's office asks federal
[SPEAKER_01]: health and education officials for
permission on Colorado's colleges and
[SPEAKER_01]: universities to obtain marijuana from
non-federal government resources for
[SPEAKER_01]: research purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The letter isn't more specific on how the
state's higher education institutions
[SPEAKER_01]: might score weed, but it was sent pursuant
to a law passed in 2014 requiring state
[SPEAKER_01]: officials to ask that Colorado colleges
and universities be allowed to cultivate
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana and its component parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Current research is riddled with bias or
insufficiencies and often conflict with
[SPEAKER_01]: one another, reads the letter written by
Deputy Attorney General David Blake.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is critical that we be allowed to fill
the void of scientific research,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this may only be done with your
assistance and cooperation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The request is not a long shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: While marijuana is, with qualifications,
legal in Colorado, it remains illegal
[SPEAKER_01]: under federal law, and getting permission
to conduct research on cannabis requires
[SPEAKER_01]: clearing a set of high hurdles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Approval from multiple federal agencies
and strict requirements on how marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: must be handled and stored.
[SPEAKER_01]: Researchers that work without the federal
government's blessing risk losing crucial
[SPEAKER_01]: federal funding for their institutions,
not to mention possible imprisonment.
[SPEAKER_01]: An international treaty that the United
States signed onto requires the federal
[SPEAKER_01]: government to designate only one place in
the country that can legally grow
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana for research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since 1968, that place has been the
University of Mississippi's National Care
[SPEAKER_01]: for Natural Products Research,
which cultivates cannabis on a 12-acre
[SPEAKER_01]: plot and sends it to approved researchers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, that 12-acre plot is rumored to be
where the G13 came from many years ago out
[SPEAKER_01]: of University of Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you know anything about that,
send me some info.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to know about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, the article goes on to say,
coincidentally, the National Institute on
[SPEAKER_01]: Drug Abuse recently put the government's
Pot Farm contract up for rebid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Applicants need to have 12 acres of
secured and video monitored outdoor space
[SPEAKER_01]: and 1,000 feet of indoor space to grow
marijuana to be able to make marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: extractions, test for potency,
and prepare preferably by hand rolling a
[SPEAKER_01]: small batch of marijuana cigarettes,
according to the official solicitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The contract's winner is expected to be
announced in the next couple of months.
[SPEAKER_01]: A spokeswoman for the National Institute
of Drug Abuse would not say how many
[SPEAKER_01]: institutions applied for the contract or
where they were, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spokesmen for the University of Colorado
and Colorado State University said their
[SPEAKER_01]: schools did not apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Drug Enforcement Administration in
2014 massively increased the amount of pot
[SPEAKER_01]: the government's official supplier can
grow from 21 kilos to 650 kilos.
[SPEAKER_01]: The increase was the result of a boom in
marijuana research interest and the
[SPEAKER_01]: University of Mississippi has pledged to
grow new strains of marijuana to give
[SPEAKER_01]: research more options for their studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a long time ago there was a video
out, a movie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot recall the name of the movie.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was something like The Union.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may have been in The Union.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may have been How We'd Won the West,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember the name of which movie
it was, but they actually showed us inside
[SPEAKER_01]: of this facility in Mississippi where they
grow this cannabis, and it was terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't growing high grade cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bitch about the weed at the
dispensaries, and I would rather smoke the
[SPEAKER_01]: weed at the dispensaries than the bullshit
that I saw being grown at University of
[SPEAKER_01]: Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_01]: That stuff was terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not really cool that they're doing
the research with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope since then they've gotten a real
grower, and they've gotten some genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they've learned a few things,
is what I saw was shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, Still, the Colorado Attorney
General's letter says the federal
[SPEAKER_01]: government falls short of being able to
supply researchers with the kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: products available in Colorado's
commercial marijuana market.
[SPEAKER_01]: State health officials have just approved
up to $8.4 million in grants for marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: studies, some of which will examine
Colorado-specific products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Attorney General's office says
more needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need the support of our federal
partners to overcome the inertia that
[SPEAKER_01]: continues to complicate state efforts in
this area, the letter states.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems like they caught on.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know that we've got the dank here in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know that they need to test,
excuse me, they know they need to examine
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado-specific products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe they are catching on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they know that that stuff that
they're growing out there at that
[SPEAKER_01]: university is a bunch of mids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of mids, shout out to my buddy
Vigorlover.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're doing well, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what this says, this article,
I want to talk about this a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are actually asking the federal
government to let the state colleges or
[SPEAKER_01]: higher educational centers in Colorado to
grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to grow pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means there will be courses or a
class that is accredited to a college
[SPEAKER_01]: where somebody is growing weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably going to be a chemistry
class or a biology class.
[SPEAKER_01]: It probably won't be a horticulture class
because they're not worried about growing
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're more worried about the effects and
science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they know how to grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's already done.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys are going to probably have some
students doing, making extracts,
[SPEAKER_01]: testing the extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even sure what they're going to
do, but I'm impressed and I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope this works because I would love to
see cannabis grown in a university and
[SPEAKER_01]: tested here in Colorado where we're not
scared and trying to lie about all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to see possibly some of my friends
that are college students able to study
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in this way in a college and
actually get college credit and build a
[SPEAKER_01]: future for themselves, I really like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really love that cannabis has kind of
opened doors and gone from us hiding to
[SPEAKER_01]: letting us kind of make a living for
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: This demographic, this age group of 25 to
40 year old males, and there are females
[SPEAKER_01]: in there too, but honestly the majority is
males.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were struggling.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were broke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now the 25 to 40 year old demographic
has something to do with ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can grow great cannabis and get in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's another news article guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm going really fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking so fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had some yerba mate and I'm drinking
a root beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I just need to slow down a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're 25 minutes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a short episode,
but I promised you that anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found this article on the cannabis as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found it entertaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, it's actually a long article.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only want to read one piece of it to you
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says cannabis Q and A naming strains
and federal rescheduling riddle,
[SPEAKER_01]: rescheduling riddle.
[SPEAKER_01]: The part I want to read about is naming
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from, it's by Susan Squibb on the
cannabis staff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the header is, welcome to our cannabis
column.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to our ask the cannabis column.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clearly you have questions about
marijuana, be it a legal concern,
[SPEAKER_01]: a health curiosity, a Colorado centric
inquiry, or something more far reaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out our expansive 100 question,
Colorado marijuana frequently asked
[SPEAKER_01]: questions first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're still curious, email your
questions to the cannabis at, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: there's ask the cannabis at gmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to participate in that,
feel free.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a lot of my answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew stuff from these guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So participate with them if you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first question got my attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, Hey cannabis, why would someone
name a strain of weed after a bio weapon
[SPEAKER_01]: that killed thousands of people?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they signed the letter put off pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this guy is asking, why would somebody
name a strain of weed after a bio weapon
[SPEAKER_01]: that killed thousands of people?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cannabis replies, you must be
talking about agent orange, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear your concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strain names can mean one thing to a
potential customer and something else to a
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breeder naming the strain while agent
orange is not a peaceful, happy or
[SPEAKER_01]: euphoric name.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you view it in historical context,
there is the other view that the name
[SPEAKER_01]: suggests an orange scent and the potency
is the bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the article says I chatted with Adam
Dunn, host of the Adam Dunn show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the Adam Dunn show.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Mitch?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Adam?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up everybody on the show?
[SPEAKER_01]: Crunchy bike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you guys are all doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Adam is the founder of the Amsterdam
based seed company, TH seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he says, having owned a seed company
myself for 21 years, I can attest that
[SPEAKER_01]: many cannabis seed companies are run by
people who have a bit more of a juvenile
[SPEAKER_01]: attitude, especially when it comes to the
names game, Dunn says.
[SPEAKER_01]: Names like agent orange, AK-47,
green crack and wheelchair weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: though quite distasteful, conjure up
images of something really strong and
[SPEAKER_01]: devastating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I doubt the people who named agent orange
really considered this was a bio weapon
[SPEAKER_01]: that killed thousands of people and
destroyed lives of countless more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Often strains are creative combinations of
the names that make up the genetic lineage
[SPEAKER_01]: or other plant attributes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adam Dunn says, having been there at the
naming of AK-47 and my own MK Ultra,
[SPEAKER_01]: I am guilty of joining the hype,
Dunn says.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was dead wrong back in 1993 when I said
AK-47 was a terrible name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was named for flowering on 47 days and
AK-47 went on to become one of the most
[SPEAKER_01]: famous strains in history.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the start of the legal adult use
market this year, the reactions of
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers to strain names is a recent
development in marijuana marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dunn points out that the cannabis industry
is very young and will go through many
[SPEAKER_01]: changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am guilty of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why it got me attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a strain called Bounty Killer and
I had a friend named Nancy tell me that
[SPEAKER_01]: she didn't really like the name and she
was reluctant to grow it because it was
[SPEAKER_01]: called Bounty Killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I called it Bounty Killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, it's named after one of my
favorite reggae artists is named Bounty
[SPEAKER_01]: Killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the way he does things and I wanted
to kind of honor him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the Capelton, which is also named
after a reggae artist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got the Kalanji Kush,
which is also named after a reggae artist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Night Nurse is named after a
reggae song.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reason I called Bounty Killer
Bounty Killer after the reggae artist is
[SPEAKER_01]: because it grows killer weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll kick your ass and it grows huge
colas and huge harvests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the bounty there and it's the
Bounty Killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't know about reggae,
it sounds like you're reaping the bounty.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're killing that huge harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you know reggae, you know that it's
the Bounty Killer and it's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: aggressive and kind of loud and it's got a
groovy beat to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I call it the Bounty
Killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to talk about why I named things
the way I name them and why strains I've
[SPEAKER_01]: created have the names they have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a grateful dead fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a dead head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of ended like the whole spiritual
side of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely a Rastafarian.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why my company is called Irie
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to honor the parents, the parent
plants that I'm using when I create a new
[SPEAKER_01]: strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes that just gets redundant and
you can't be creative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to draw from Rasta culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grateful dead culture and like positive
loving hippie culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I've got a strain called Heart
of Gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the golden goat crossed to the
grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: It almost got called horn dog,
but that didn't sound as good for the vibe
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to promote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heart of Gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you smoke that weed and you meditate,
your heart is calm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your heart is filled with love.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's better than a heart of gold,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a big heart of gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just pumping love and positive
energy and it's got golden goat in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's Heart of Gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is golden goat crossed to the lemon
skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's lemon, obviously the lemon,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And my name is Jeff and I wanted something
like, you got Aryan's haze and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: Neville's haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not have a lemon Jeffrey that's named
after me, the guy that made it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was kind of my little stingy move on
the cannabis world there.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys are talking about Agent Orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know who made Agent Orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was sub cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's orange velvet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an orange velvet to Jack the Ripper
cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think Agent Orange is a perfect
name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just said another name,
Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Jack Herrera crossed to other stuff
basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sub cool didn't want to use the name
Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just, that's how these names come
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a strain that I wanted to call it
the golden road.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a golden goat cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course that's a grateful dead song.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my names come from trying to honor the
parents strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I did get creative.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say this name here on the
show that it's not out yet, but I've,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is my cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gorilla glue number four crossed to the
grateful dog is called grip tape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's for my skateboard friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what grip tape is on your
skateboard?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that shit that makes your feet stick
to the board a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it grip tape because it is sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be called fly paper, but fly
paper is already taken.
[SPEAKER_01]: And grip tape kind of honors my skateboard
friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where the names come from.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not just spouting out random shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some guys are.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my best sellers lately has actually
been a strain that's called blue helix.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually blue dream crossed to the
grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: So grateful dog gives you a dog name,
the blue blue healer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's named after a dog to keep the
grateful dog reference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also got the word healer in there
because it's going to make you feel
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it shows me trying to be silly and
trying to be creative and honor the
[SPEAKER_01]: parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to name it something,
you know, you can't just call it X five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you can, but that would be boring,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not good marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's enough of that article.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to talk about how I named
strains and why I named them, what I named
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you gave me like anything that I
crossed to ghost OG, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: called ghost, whatever I crossed it to,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ghost dog, ghost goat, the golden ghost,
you know, shit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just, if I cross golden goat to stuff,
it probably got the word goal to put in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just how I do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only been going for 32 minutes,
you guys, but I don't have a lot else to
[SPEAKER_01]: say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly didn't have time to prepare for
this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I didn't want to stress out over
this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to hang out with you guys,
take a couple dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get a dab together.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys take a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to ramble here while you guys
get a dab together to dab with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am proud because I'm going to dab
shatter that I made myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made hash and then spins vac purged it
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it in there and got it going,
but I had to leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he finished it for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stuff got purged for 35 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty damn dank.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you got a dab ready by now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take a dab together and then we'll
start wrapping up the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to hit the, I've got the Hitman
E-Series Sidecar with a highly educated
[SPEAKER_01]: infinity nail on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Attached to the highly educated infinity
nail is the Emotec G-Nail that's always
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got mine set to 850 right now,
which people say is kind of high,
[SPEAKER_01]: but honestly, if I put it any lower,
I don't get a big chunky dab when I carb
[SPEAKER_01]: cap it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Emotec.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Hitman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to highly educated Titanium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And shout out to Garden of Weedon and
Angela too, since I'm doing shout outs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like those big old chunky dabs and
you're not sure if you're going to cry or
[SPEAKER_01]: cough or die.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this will be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to do the show closing
without coughing after pretty good size
[SPEAKER_01]: dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you guys for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I promise you the next episode is going to
be better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope Spence will be here, but I can't
promise you he'll be here before episode
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 if not on episode 50.
