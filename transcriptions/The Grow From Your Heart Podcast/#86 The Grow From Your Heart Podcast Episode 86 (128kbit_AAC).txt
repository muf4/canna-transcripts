[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, the reason we have
gathered here today, I want to talk to my
[SPEAKER_02]: buddy Sloppy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was talking about wanting to be on the
podcast and I was like, well, what's up,
[SPEAKER_02]: bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, I want to talk about my
life changing transition from,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to kind of summarize here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Slop's kind of a, Slop's a buff dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got some muscles on him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's tatted up.
[SPEAKER_02]: He looks like he could be the guy in Grand
Theft Auto kind of.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, people, people, I was going to talk
about that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like people would look at me and just
assume I'm just an asshole.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I hold the door for people and
they're like, should I walk through?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I'm not going to slam it on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's growing a little bit of a fuzzy
hairdo.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's as long as I've ever seen his hair.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't going to let the man get called
out on that, but I got no issues with
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fro is strong in this one,
but Slop looks like a straight criminal
[SPEAKER_02]: and we're not going to get too deep into
it, but Sloppy does have a history and
[SPEAKER_02]: Slop has moved to Colorado and I've heard
a lot about Slop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know about Slop's past.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know where he's come from and to tell
you the truth, man, since I've known you,
[SPEAKER_02]: you've been nothing but a respectful,
respectable fucking dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generous, honest dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, for sure, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fist bump across the table here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if any of you guys need a dab,
let me know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Joe's hanging out over here kind of
quiet, kind of listening in, hanging out.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll chime in when he's got something
worth saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you guys need a dab, let me know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get it going.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll slide the dabs over here at their own
reach.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always with dabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I was telling everybody how much
of a criminal you are and how much when I
[SPEAKER_02]: finally meet you, you're fucking
respectful.
[SPEAKER_03]: You would never assume that I had any kind
of, besides just stereotyping,
[SPEAKER_03]: like tattoos and things of that nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're wearing a wife beater and some
shorts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, hey, we can't be seen right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't be comfortable.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, besides stereotyping,
like just from appearance, the way that I
[SPEAKER_03]: present myself, you wouldn't really assume
that I had any past experience with
[SPEAKER_03]: organizations or just criminal activity at
all.
[SPEAKER_03]: But man, the main thing I want to talk
about is just really like how much has
[SPEAKER_03]: changed being able to smoke bud freely and
grow bud and the stress reliever that
[SPEAKER_03]: comes with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I started smoking weed back in
fifth grade.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know the age that you are in fifth
grade.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you're 11.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you're 11 or 12.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't want to.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were probably 14.
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened, I never failed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually always had good grades.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a smart guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was just an asshole.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to a minority school.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am not a minority.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was integrated into a minority school
and put in the paper and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was fifth grade through 12th grade
in one school.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I used to walk home with all the older
kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't say any names, but shout out to
who you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the neighborhood was right
behind the school.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we walk home and they always smoked
every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then one day they were just like,
do you want to smoke too?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't even know it was bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen other people smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't really know the difference
between what people are smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember that day we smoked a blunt.
[SPEAKER_03]: We went and sat in their shed and played
Sega Genesis for like two hours until my
[SPEAKER_03]: mom got off work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they never brought up anything being
wrong until right when my mom was going to
[SPEAKER_03]: get there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they looked at me and said,
tell her you have a headache and go to
[SPEAKER_03]: your room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't eat anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that was the daily routine after
that forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've always had to hide smoking weed
and all of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a paraphernalia charge for a roach,
literally just a roach in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where I'm from, North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're assholes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they don't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: They came to a house.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were serving a warrant.
[SPEAKER_03]: They smelled marijuana, came in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was the only white person there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was like two bongs in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the police came up to me and they were
like, oh, these must be yours because
[SPEAKER_03]: you're white.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm a smart ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I looked at them and was like,
actually, I smoke blunts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of just being like, I don't smoke
because, you know, I'm an asshole.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they walked over to the ashtray,
grabbed a roach, dropped in in front of me
[SPEAKER_03]: and said paraphernalia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is still to this day on my record.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that a felony or a misdemeanor?
[SPEAKER_03]: Misdemeanor.
OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate that there's only two levels of
charges like misdemeanor felony because
[SPEAKER_03]: felonies are in there with like rapists
and murderers.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's messed up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in North Carolina, you can get a
felony.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they changed it now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I was growing up, anything over a
half ounce of marijuana was a felony.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'd be put in with the rapists.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: For having some weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put Joe in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now I think you can have an ounce and
a half, which still isn't shit like you
[SPEAKER_03]: can have a pound a half.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to hurt anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But marijuana really gave me an out from
where I was before I was in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in a camper that was like 10 by 10
with no insulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had nails coming through the roof.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I literally ran an extension cord from
the camper to somebody's well,
[SPEAKER_03]: because, you know, at the well,
they have the outlets for like lights and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had my Mac computer in there and I
just made music and and smoked weed and
[SPEAKER_03]: did mushrooms and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a good life.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was it was all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was somehow I still got women
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was it was shitty, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then one day a good friend of mine,
Spencer from Garden Weedon, a big shout
[SPEAKER_03]: out to all of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Matty, Mike, everybody, really.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he just called or like we were talking
on Facebook at first.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he called me and he was like,
are you really sleeping outside?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not really outside,
but yeah, kind of.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, well, would you rather just
come here and grow weed?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was really an impulse decision.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like everybody thought I was bullshitting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, in two weeks, I'm out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm going to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of how I heard it,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matty was like, you're going to meet our
friend Sloppy in like two weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to take the room downstairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did take that room and I slept right
next to that oven forever and just like
[SPEAKER_03]: chilled out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, no, I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just told everybody I was leaving.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody believed me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two weeks came and I was gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't miss it at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been it's been amazing here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just there's so many people with the same
mind state and positive energies and just
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to help each other and progress in
life.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like that's big.
[SPEAKER_03]: People don't like progressing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, some people are stuck and want to
be OK with where they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: In content.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's such a plague.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I got this group of people here
at this table, because we're all people
[SPEAKER_02]: that are all about moving each other and
ourselves forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit can't ever be comfortable.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as you get comfortable,
that's when you start fucking up
[SPEAKER_02]: stagnation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to be ahead, you got to keep
moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're if life is super duper easy and
you do the same thing every day and not
[SPEAKER_01]: much changes and you're unhappy about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only one thing to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make the progression.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take the next steps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you're already stuck and
frustrated, what are you going to do to
[SPEAKER_02]: make yourself more stuck and frustrated?
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to think it through.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, yeah, grab your nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's do it like a good friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joey Diaz would say, grow some fucking
balls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, he would say, don't be scared.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you were moving in a trailer and big
shout out to Gardner Weedon because,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, if Spence and Maddie would not
have encouraged you to move out here,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would never have met you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much love, much respect to that whole
crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some of my favorite people right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't know Joe either.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gardner Weedon is a beautiful bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have only showed me extreme love in
all situations.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the people that they've introduced to
me have been totally cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you came out here and now you live with
Spence for a little while and you started
[SPEAKER_02]: learning how to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, I can remember so vividly the
first time that Gardner Weedon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I can remember the first time I took
an official dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got off the plane and they got a dab
ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when she pulled the rig and the torch
out, Maddie pulled the rig and the torch
[SPEAKER_03]: out, I looked at her and I was like,
I don't really know what that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I want to smoke that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she was like, no, it's weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, weed is green.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I took a dab and I literally just
laid my face on the window and just
[SPEAKER_03]: stared.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're saying you might have been in
the car when you got your first dab?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you were off the plane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Within three seconds of being in the car,
she was like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Maddie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maddie loves us and Maddie dabs everybody
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I go sit down at the house,
Maddie's got, you want to dab?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like as soon as I walk in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dab isn't under us.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's globs.
[SPEAKER_03]: She globs you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a half gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll come to the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Joe's nodding his head like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can't add anything to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is 100% accurate.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can totally remember the first time that
they were like, the lights cut on and they
[SPEAKER_03]: were like, brought me into the garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to say it was all white widow
and two blue dream plants in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all you could smell was the blue
dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds about right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember those days.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember the feeling like in my body of
like overwhelming sensations that like I
[SPEAKER_03]: honestly thought that I would never
experience something like that without
[SPEAKER_03]: going to another country because it's
crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: But back in North Carolina, if you have
that many plants, you are, they think
[SPEAKER_03]: you're a fucking terrorist.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, come SWAT force ready,
tason and shooting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this plant is going to spread like
Jumanji and kill the town.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's so ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the worst thing about a raid man is
the first thing they do is shoot your dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so fucking shitty.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this sounds crazy, but if they
shoot my dog in front of me, it's going
[SPEAKER_03]: down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm going to strike an officer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to say that, but for real.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hypothetically, you just might.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, for real, because that's a
loved family member.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Harvey and Bane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and they're monsters now.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need their own Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bro, they need their own Instagram motion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: These dogs are bad ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need their own Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to pit bulls.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're my you know, and I I hate
the judgment on pit bulls like how you
[SPEAKER_03]: can't bring them to Denver and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the sweetest dogs I know is a pit
bull and she will climb up into your lap
[SPEAKER_02]: and let you pet her like a kitty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's precious and she's a pit bull.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then her boyfriend slash brother,
because I'm not sure what the relationship
[SPEAKER_02]: is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen a little bit of both from both.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that dude is also one.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a dumbass, but he's one of the
sweetest dogs ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's made of bricks, but he's still one of
the coolest dogs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dogs are the same as children.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can raise them to be good or you can
raise dumbasses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's some dogs got some shit in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to some children.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some dogs are just born a little demon
inside, just like some kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to slap the shit out of them once
in a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yo, I'm I'm down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo, just bash me with questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't bash you with questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm with whatever, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like hearing about how you moved
here and then you started growing weed and
[SPEAKER_02]: you saw some white widow and some blue
dream and it blew your fucking mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get to trim that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my first trim.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember everybody was all like,
like not wanting to trim, acting like it
[SPEAKER_03]: was about to be this like hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trimming is the worst.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then my first time I was like,
this is like fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like this is the greatest thing
ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now, you know, I've trimmed like a
hundred or so more plants and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_03]: fuck trimming.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can totally remember the first time
doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love if I have company from out of
town coming, trying to get them into a
[SPEAKER_03]: harvest and just get them involved in any
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because like I said, like a lot of people
on on the in any legal states in general,
[SPEAKER_03]: just think that like this is impossible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yeah, it's mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something we can totally do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can legalize cannabis nationwide.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can all be growing a little bit of
ganja in our house and not have to go to a
[SPEAKER_02]: store, not have to, excuse me,
not have to go to the street corner,
[SPEAKER_02]: not have to fucking waste money on
cannabis and not have to worry or wonder.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were all talking about earlier how we
all love that we grow the weed in the
[SPEAKER_02]: group.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you bring your herb and I'm not
afraid to smoke Joe's herb and Sloppy
[SPEAKER_02]: brings his herb and I'll totally smoke
that and I pull out mine and they will
[SPEAKER_02]: totally smoke that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if anybody else came up, there'd be a
few people.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some residents.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you put in this shit?
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't always like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to smoke some straight brick weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I started out with.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, everybody involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the 90s, I was smoking that sexy,
maxi brick for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: 500 a pound and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to trim that shit with Spence and
Matty.
[SPEAKER_02]: They taught you how to trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what pretty much springboarded you
into growing?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really, it was really just I needed
something to have that I could be proud of
[SPEAKER_03]: and look forward to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And involve myself in and keep my mind
functioning and have goals and objectives
[SPEAKER_03]: with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, as somebody that smokes,
growing has always been a dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I wish I could try to do this and see
what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as soon as a dream is presented,
you have to take it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't take it, you're lame.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like straight up.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is his anti-crime, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember, yo, it is, it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis helps me in so many ways without
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I would have and failure
without cannabis and failure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I would be the person that I
am today.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's been your biggest failure at
growing cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, um, mites.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking spider mites.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking mites, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like not thoroughly checking clones from
people and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then not being on top of sprays.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just mites being a persistent
little fucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you won't do that again, will you?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's beautiful in there right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can remember my first harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: My first harvest, honestly, blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll co-sign that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, you know, very good first grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: First time I've ever grown anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Black Cherry Camp, shout out to Irie.
[SPEAKER_03]: That shit was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark purple and sticky.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeti.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Yeti was so dense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Jesse for his find on that
Yeti.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had train wreck that day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just smelled so potent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Sour Patch Kush, which was,
I mean, it's just good smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that the Salt Pepper Ketchup?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the SPK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Salt Pepper Ketchup.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was with them once and we were doing
clones and it said SPK on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, yo, is this Salt Pepper
Ketchup?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where it came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what the strain's been known
as now in this group.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo, it's just, it's so beautiful here.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you smoke and you want to be somewhere
where you're accepted and you have events
[SPEAKER_03]: that you can go to and like, you don't
have to go out of the country anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could come here or really you could
just start doing stuff to make it legal
[SPEAKER_03]: where you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I keep telling people to do.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that you don't have to move.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stand up for your state.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I mean, it's not going to happen
everywhere, but it could.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's already an activist group in your
state making strides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, whatever state you are in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find the normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just start in the basic, easiest place.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike gave us a nice lesson a few episodes
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's titled getting involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you guys want to learn how to get
involved with some sort of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: movement, definitely check out that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also just contact your local
normal, NORML, the National Organization
[SPEAKER_02]: for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: Contact them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll tell you how to get started in
teaming up with locals in your area,
[SPEAKER_02]: how to change the rules and do stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Slop is here now though.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's gotten away from his nefarious
life.
[SPEAKER_02]: His nefarious activities.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's put some people behind him,
changed himself up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, dude, I see you doing well,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got yourself a normal day job and
you're doing shit, taking care of
[SPEAKER_02]: business.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else do you do when you're not at
work and when you're not in the garden?
[SPEAKER_03]: I make music.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the main things I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like rapping.
[SPEAKER_03]: I paint.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love painting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you just take up painting or is that
something?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm fairly new at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not great either.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude sold one already.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I sold a Fear and Loss Basing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I saw that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was pretty fresh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big ups to who bought that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like Dan Dangles, 420, I think.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big ups to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I could give anybody advice,
it'd be do stuff that you enjoy doing and
[SPEAKER_03]: do it as much as you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to go in the garden as much as I
can, making music.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a regular garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: My broccoli's are a little bit looking
amazing right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, you got a garden in the front of
your house.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was checking it out on the way out the
door the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Told you, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come through and pick some stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody said that the other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, yo, what if you catch people
in the front of your house just picking
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, if they need it that bad,
they can have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can steal my zucchini.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you just came and took my cucumbers?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good salad, motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man, that's so funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, just do what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And do the most of it, like for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And be nice to other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of conceited people in this
world that just don't even notice other
[SPEAKER_03]: individuals in their life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, how do you go somewhere public and
not acknowledge that you're going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: around other people?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Slop's way of thinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Came and dropped some random knowledge on
an accident.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man, I call people out sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like the other day, this lady,
shout out to the lady, just pushed her
[SPEAKER_03]: cart right in the entrance door of Walmart
and just left it there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, yo, you could push it two
feet that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she tried to keep walking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, yo, you lazy bitch.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got mad as hell.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she turned around and looked at me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, and you try to say the youth
is bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like put your cart up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just blocked everybody from walking
because you had like, you're the only
[SPEAKER_03]: person at Walmart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Slop is calling bitches out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a champ.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll say something.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, that's why I like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can go home and smoke and forget about
that fucking lazy bitch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like something I would have
ranted about on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yo, shout out to Periscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I knew all I had to say was
Periscope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for real.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo, everybody jump on Periscope and make
it a daily thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, oh, I'm Sloppy919 on Periscope and
all social media.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yo, the other day I was chilling with
some kids in Tokyo and they were
[SPEAKER_03]: skateboarding and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really cool to see like real
perspectives of other places and the way
[SPEAKER_03]: that they interact and just all kinds of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really enjoy Periscope.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the best social networking app out at
the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like watching or broadcasting more?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say watching just because I like
other countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like seeing what's up in China.
[SPEAKER_02]: China is one of the best feeds to watch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that and Japan, Russia.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some kids in Russia doing crazy
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but they're so mean to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they see that you're an American,
they'll be cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be talking in a Russian accent in
Russian and they'll see something that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're American like, oh America,
fuck you, we kill you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they just go right back to the
Russian and you're like, oh shit,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting out of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brazil is super nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck Dubai as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not even trying to be a dick about
it, but the United Arab Emirates does not
[SPEAKER_02]: like white people when we go on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want us there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo, I mean, there's been wars going on for
like thousands of years, but I ain't got
[SPEAKER_03]: no part of that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Leave me alone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just trying to scope it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just trying to see what the fuck is up
over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're broadcasting, let me watch.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to see some sheiks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some sheiks and some sheiks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everyone in the room is slightly
addicted to Periscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: There might be a slight addiction here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to do at least once a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I jump on and do a quick, like sometimes
you never know with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could turn into an hour and a half,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you got people watching and they're
talking to me, it could be an hour and a
[SPEAKER_02]: half rent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I get podcast information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like people ask me questions and I'll be
like, Oh yeah, I'm going to write that
[SPEAKER_02]: down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you that on the next show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I get stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I've actually done a live show
with everything on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully I'll do that in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't announce it because I wanted to
do like a practical practice run.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, let's just get in here and see
without telling everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next time I'm all like pre planet,
it'll be like some night at seven 10 and
[SPEAKER_02]: be like this night, I'm going to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't say a day because I don't want
anyone to think there's a real day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're going to join Periscope and
just be a fucking creeper, just,
[SPEAKER_03]: just watch porn, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like you're fucking weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: I block a lot of people on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got that troll ban hammer going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ain't scurred.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chaplin down with the trolls.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, we've been going like 25 minutes
sloppy.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's next for you, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got your feet on the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got some shit set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You seem to be doing pretty good for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said it yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quit moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you quit moving, you'll get
stagnant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's next?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really going to start trying to really
step my garden up and try to grow some
[SPEAKER_03]: amazing weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to bring weed to my friends that
they can look at and be like, damn,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm also trying to move my family out
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a big family man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mama will be here Saturday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your nephew is cute as shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see those Facebook and Insta pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Chance.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a little guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to be a ladies man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to get the fam out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But honestly, honestly, if you really want
to know what's next for me, I'm,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to, I'm trying to get out of
the country within the next like 10 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to be exploring places.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to check out other places,
but, but I would never go somewhere that,
[SPEAKER_03]: that cannabis is frowned upon.
Fucked all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to go visit those places.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to Dubai and go walk through
those places where those guys on Periscope
[SPEAKER_02]: hate us and go Periscope there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go Periscope there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, we get ran over by a camel in two
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they drive tanks and Humvees and shit
down the street and Maybox and McLaren's.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, for real, if I had to say like,
definitely what's next is just a self
[SPEAKER_03]: improvement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to grow as a person.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So improve as the self, get the family out
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once the family's here,
you're going to take off and go travel to
[SPEAKER_02]: other countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I say that I've been saying that
forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It may never happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would have to be the same as moving to
Colorado and impulse doing now thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just like to, to experience other
cultures more than just Periscope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go feel the vibe, taste the food,
smell the air, put your feet in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shake hands, get their diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like a way to live.
[SPEAKER_02]: On that immune system.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to travel all over the place too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually cannabis will take me all over
the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of things coming in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up worldwide podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'll, I'll throw a fucking book
bag on and do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can worldwide pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: All I need is one book bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can do a whole podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just need the zoom H6 and a book bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got this going.
[SPEAKER_03]: To make us like a little portable,
uh, battery fucking book bag.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Solar panel.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a book bag email.
[SPEAKER_02]: Book bag email.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wave of the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want one for the car, but I foresee a
lot of arm burns.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo, and, and the thing with the car is you
could have the quick D attachment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it just looks like a breathalyzer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if the cow pulls you over, he's like,
Oh, this guy has been drinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've chilled out in the car on the dabs in
the car, the Periscope in the car,
[SPEAKER_02]: the fucking speeding in the car because I
got pulled over.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good call.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once is enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I got, I got off like fucking
scot-free.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a six foot five dreadlocked Rasta man
that my car smelled like skunky and he was
[SPEAKER_02]: pushing, dinky madness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that cop had no problem with it and he
let me go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just going to take one for the team
and chill out in the car a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The beauty of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where else does that happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: He smelled my breath and when he realized
there was no alcohol on my breath,
[SPEAKER_02]: he let me go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had actually eaten a chocolate covered
jalapeno just moments before he pulled me
[SPEAKER_02]: over.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when he smelled my breath, he made this
wrinkled up face like, Oh God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He knew I wasn't drinking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's all about how you handle
those situations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo, even, even if you don't like them,
which you really have no reason not to,
[SPEAKER_03]: they got to do their job to, uh,
just be their best fucking friend for 10
[SPEAKER_03]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like how hard is, but Hey sir,
how are you doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, them teeth are white as hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, um, you know, just, I'm just saying
like, I say as little as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, everything ends in yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty much like, yeah, I had the
license registration, proof of insurance
[SPEAKER_02]: in my hand by the time he got up to the
window.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, you just got to do that kind
of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, dude, guys, if you guys,
if you got to deal with cops, just know
[SPEAKER_02]: your rights, but keep your mouth shut.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's don't try to be assertive to the
police.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just do what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try not to get shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep your hands visible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind, they got a gun and they're,
they're afraid of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know who you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, they know who I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been going close to a half hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys got anything funny you want to
ramble about here at the end of the show?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been kind of ramble in any way,
but anything you want to wrap up with slop
[SPEAKER_02]: since it's a kind of, kind of the sloppy
nine one nine show this time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Slop tart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, slop up a lot of dabs, a lot of dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I, I, once I Twittered like,
how many ways can you say sloppy?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I literally got like 70 something
responses of like the slopinator and shit
[SPEAKER_03]: like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the craziest, um, nah, I just really
appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo, this is, this is awesome, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate being here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you know, I know, I know what's up,

[SPEAKER_03]: In the room with Irish shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I look, I look forward to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I look forward to more.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh dude, we'll do this again.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joe, how about yourself, man?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything to any words of wisdom for the
end of a podcast?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah, nothing too much else.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I happen to know that Joe can throw
down a hell of a beat box.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try to make this happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it wouldn't be right if I didn't try
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I got to read a commercial or like
some closing shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, uh, I'm going to try to get Joe
to do a little bit of beat box and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then maybe we can get slop and I never
gave slop credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys remember that in the garden of
weed and getting weeded song?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my homie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sloppy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We played that on the podcast a couple of
times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thanks for doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I started reading this and before I
asked you guys to beat box, huge thanks to
[SPEAKER_02]: both of you guys coming and taking an hour
out of your day and being on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are welcome back.

you.

[SPEAKER_02]: Um, start your own garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I have to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's finally thought of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be the theme of Joe's rap
and slop's going to freestyle over here in
[SPEAKER_02]: a minute.

[SPEAKER_02]: But I would love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you checked me out on Facebook,
Instagram, Twitter, periscope,
[SPEAKER_02]: YouTube, uh, whatever else you can think
of, just, just check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love all the interaction, whichever one
you do follow me there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't forget that the show is available on
itunes, stitcher, and every single episode
[SPEAKER_02]: is archived on iregeneticscolorado.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, you don't know all about the
donation button by now, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to the website, go to the podcast tab,
hit the donation button.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you feel like the show is worth a
couple of bucks, if you feel like my time,
[SPEAKER_02]: my energy was worth a few bucks,
throw in a few bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm seriously trying to work up to a zoom
H six so that we could take the podcast a
[SPEAKER_02]: few more places.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I would love to get that here before,
uh, the next couple of months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, if you want to make a
contribution, just go to the website,
[SPEAKER_02]: throw a few bucks at the PayPal account.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not begging for a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you got $5, if you've got $10,
that would work.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to add some zeros on to the
end of that, I am not going to complain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I'm begging now, so I'm going
to move on with this part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to my guests once again for coming
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, big shout out to my Ninja Spence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks again for listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys until next time, take a fat dab
and give your mama hug for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, one, one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Up, up, up.
