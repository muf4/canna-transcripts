[SPEAKER_00]: getting some funky comments You guys
promised me that you would send so many
[SPEAKER_00]: positive comments that I didn't even
notice the bullshit anymore Mission
[SPEAKER_00]: accomplished.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.

[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That did not go unnoticed I asked for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe you a big thank you for that Now
also I want to do a recap from a previous
[SPEAKER_00]: episode in the last episode I did talk
about somebody's seedling They planted a
[SPEAKER_00]: seedling that had it in a container with
their soil or their soilless mix I said
[SPEAKER_00]: from the best of my knowledge from looking
and my observations and the description
[SPEAKER_00]: that that plant was probably too wet and
too cold we did get an update this one
[SPEAKER_00]: came from our friend and it said I just
listened to the latest episode thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: for listening it says awesome I will send
you an email this evening with more
[SPEAKER_00]: details but the show was very helpful and
I think you were right too cold and too
[SPEAKER_00]: much water so it's great to get some
feedback when people agree we know that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're actually helping people when they
say you were right that means we gave them
[SPEAKER_00]: a diagnosis they know next time not to
water so much maybe make it a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: warmer we're correcting gardens which is
setting ourselves up for success which is
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're all about here at the grow from
your heart podcast so thank you for the
[SPEAKER_00]: great feedback I just feel good to know
that what I said the guidance I gave the
[SPEAKER_00]: advice that I offered was helpful and that
the diagnosis I gave from what we've
[SPEAKER_00]: determined was probably correct that does
feels good to know that I don't always
[SPEAKER_00]: know that the advice I give was accurate
on here I'm talking to a camera it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: at least three or four days for me to get
any feedback and a lot of times I really
[SPEAKER_00]: don't so thank you for the great feedback
I'll quit rambling and move on with the
[SPEAKER_00]: show I've been talking about a black
friday sale that's right if you've been
[SPEAKER_00]: paying attention you know that there is a
black friday sale coming up on the irie
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics merch store excuse me for that I

[SPEAKER_00]: me clear my throat anyway there is a black
friday sale coming up on the irie genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: merch store if you go to iriegenetics.com

[SPEAKER_00]: 25th through the 30th all right now we can
move on and get into the main part of this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast episode I do have a message from
our friend magic mike here on patreon big
[SPEAKER_00]: up to magic mike hope you're killing it
thank you for the continued patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: support we'll get right to the question it
says I made a fatal mistake by mixing a
[SPEAKER_00]: tent with your starstruck so we had a
package of irie genetics starstruck seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and what he calls some knockoff genetics
of GDP and runs normally when I'm talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about a grow that went wrong and somebody
got seeds I do not mention the strains
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is not my job to excuse me I'm
not even gonna edit that I'm a human that
[SPEAKER_00]: happened my throat's clogged up today it
is not my job as a podcaster or a anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: to call out another seed brand unless
they're doing something malicious unless
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got intent we did call out one
company before for selling fake seeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: are not what they're claiming to be but
that's not what this is about most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: time I don't say the strain names the
reason I did say that this was GDP and
[SPEAKER_00]: runs is because they said they got
knockoff genetics they didn't get these
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses from the original makers so if you
got knockoff genetics I'll say it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: knockoff of that they didn't buy the real
shit so I'm not dissing whoever made GDP
[SPEAKER_00]: or whoever made the runs there they
shouldn't feel any problem because this
[SPEAKER_00]: was a knockoff product if it was the
original I wouldn't have said the strain
[SPEAKER_00]: name and I'm using the strain names
because he talks about these strains so
[SPEAKER_00]: much in the story here that if I tried to
alternate and replace it it would confuse
[SPEAKER_00]: all of us so I had to keep the names the
same just to make this make sense I feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like I did just did one of those names
have been changed to protect the innocent
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of speeches oh by the way shout out
to dabs I'm stoned as fucking rambly here
[SPEAKER_00]: we go this message goes on it says I got
some knockoff genetics of GDP and runs the
[SPEAKER_00]: GDP hermed early and I caught it well
that's always unfortunate but I'm glad you
[SPEAKER_00]: caught it it does say I took it out cut
the pollen sacks and sprayed the plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: the rest of the tent down with water I
happened to keep a smaller tent that I had
[SPEAKER_00]: and quarantined it and then about two and
a half weeks later the runs hermed all
[SPEAKER_00]: right so I at one point let's see star
stroke what point hermd early it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: say exactly when it says hermd early if it
hermd early it got further in your tent
[SPEAKER_00]: then it would have in mind something that
herms early something that shows obvious
[SPEAKER_00]: signs of intersex does not last long in my
garden if it shows me herm bye bye I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: need that there are plenty of seeds plenty
of plants I don't need a headache this is
[SPEAKER_00]: like the dating pool this person already
told me we are not compatible by why spend
[SPEAKER_00]: another date with it why spend another
week with it in your case why spend more
[SPEAKER_00]: lights air water soil electricity
nutrients time energy why waste all that
[SPEAKER_00]: shit on a problematic plant so it got
further in your grow then it would have in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind if it shows intersex that early
unless it is something magical that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been really trying to get I'm not even
gonna fuck with it and still I would
[SPEAKER_00]: really consider getting rid of it so it
got further in your spot than it did mine
[SPEAKER_00]: it goes on though it says about two and a
half weeks later the runs hermd I was a
[SPEAKER_00]: short and stocky plant that grows a tight
pattern so I made a point for a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks after the first intersex plant to
check the others very close including the
[SPEAKER_00]: runs after a few weeks I thought I was
safe but when taking them out for the
[SPEAKER_00]: first time in a week I found what looks to
be freshly popped male flowers all right
[SPEAKER_00]: so our friend had a GDP plant he noticed
that that was showing intersex signs he
[SPEAKER_00]: took that plant put it into another tent
because he happened to have another tent
[SPEAKER_00]: where he could quarantine things good move
there if you really insist on keeping that
[SPEAKER_00]: now two and a half weeks later we have
discovered that the other plant in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room which is a runt plant is showing male
flowers so it goes on to say I repeated
[SPEAKER_00]: what I did before but I don't have another
tent or another light and the idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: running three tents isn't something I
could do and I know I should call the runs
[SPEAKER_00]: and or the GDP but honestly I believe
where am I I caught my I believe I caught
[SPEAKER_00]: the GDP in time but I never stopped
checking it and haven't had issues with it
[SPEAKER_00]: repeating all right so if you think you
got the GDP on time it might not throw out
[SPEAKER_00]: new nanners new male flowers but it could
the runs you said you saw full-on male
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers and two and a half weeks in that's
probably gonna be about three weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was two and a half weeks later
could be four weeks honestly you are you
[SPEAKER_00]: have much more leeway in your garden than
I do of course I have access to many more
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds many more clones I've got a lot more
backup plans but these plants showing me
[SPEAKER_00]: intersex traits at this point of the cycle
they would be gone they wouldn't even make
[SPEAKER_00]: it this far in my grow out there this
question wouldn't even be asked and say
[SPEAKER_00]: intersex intersex snip snip bye bye they'd
be out of there because there are so many
[SPEAKER_00]: other seeds and clones that aren't going
to give you a headache you're already
[SPEAKER_00]: getting a headache from it I wouldn't I
wouldn't fuck with it so I know that
[SPEAKER_00]: further on in the question you asked me
what to do and we will answer that my
[SPEAKER_00]: overall answer is going to be continue
them because it's so far in but don't ever
[SPEAKER_00]: grow these again bro call them chop them
why are you wasting your time with these
[SPEAKER_00]: you know that they're crazy don't fuck
with them ever again you know that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: problematic don't waste time space energy
growing should be delightful is the
[SPEAKER_00]: overall word growing should be great you
should feel good about the entire process
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a headache to work they will throw
flowers that do not contain any pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: sterile is the word I would have used that
looks more like just a skinny dried up
[SPEAKER_00]: banana it looks like a dried up flower
that wouldn't do anything if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting full-on male flowers that are
opening it's a good chance there's pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: in there a good chance I didn't say for
sure but many times yes some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants can't throw out male flowers that
are non-viable that are sterile that are
[SPEAKER_00]: non-potent I guess impotent is might be
the correct word I'm gonna say non-potent
[SPEAKER_00]: because impotent makes me think it can't
get its peepee hard I'm gonna keep going
[SPEAKER_00]: with this it says how would you deal with
this issue that's a really good question
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly I said it before these plants
wouldn't make it this far as soon as I saw
[SPEAKER_00]: these problems choppity chop chop chop
these plants would be gone but I have
[SPEAKER_00]: access to more plants and more what may be
more important is I have access to more
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine you may be relying on these
plants for medicine which let me get off
[SPEAKER_00]: on a side tangent here I'm gonna put my
finger here so I know where the fuck I am
[SPEAKER_00]: so that we can get back to this there we
go side tangent I would never have let
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants get this big they would have
been little tiny plants I would have
[SPEAKER_00]: tested them out to determine if they have
intersex traits or if they're problematic
[SPEAKER_00]: before I grew them this far in my last run
when I was growing bigger plants these
[SPEAKER_00]: would have been in the side in the corner
little tiny plants showing me if they were
[SPEAKER_00]: worth the shit or not so that I could test
run them and then we grow them in big pots
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not what's it I'm not talking down on
you because you didn't do a test run but
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a way to prevent it next time that
would have helped you out especially since
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got two tents you could be doing
test runs in that second tent and full-on
[SPEAKER_00]: production runs in the big tent find
keeper that way you skipped a step is what
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm trying to say there was a
phenol hunt step skipped in here these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants should have been auditioned you got
them on the big stage they never played
[SPEAKER_00]: open mic night you got to give them an
open mic night before you put them on the
[SPEAKER_00]: big stage in my opinion all right let me
get myself back on track here I did save
[SPEAKER_00]: my space with my finger it says should I
put the runs in with the GDP yes that's I
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately would have done that I didn't
realize you did not do that already as
[SPEAKER_00]: soon as I saw intersex on the other plant
it would have gone over to the intersex
[SPEAKER_00]: hotel whichever you want to call that spot
I would have gone over there to let it
[SPEAKER_00]: finish yeah if you insist on finishing
those definitely put them both over there
[SPEAKER_00]: in the freak show hotel and then leave the
non-intersex plant in the other room and
[SPEAKER_00]: see what's happening it goes on to say the
reason I'm trying to save it is because
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in prohibition land and it is hard to
come by my state just now started rolling
[SPEAKER_00]: out medical but dispensaries are a bit off
still without the still without okay are
[SPEAKER_00]: still a bit off there should be a comma or
a period there but not a big deal without
[SPEAKER_00]: these means no meds and I will make my own
edibles so I know I can use them that way
[SPEAKER_00]: if it comes down to having been pollinated
that is a that's kind of what I was
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking if these plants are pollinated
and have seeds it's better to have
[SPEAKER_00]: something with seeds in it than to have no
medicine you did state that the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries aren't quite ready for you
yet oftentimes in a new place the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries are so expensive that it's
not even accessible to patients they say
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a medical program but then they
charge you $500 for an ounce and how's a
[SPEAKER_00]: sick person gonna have a $500 extra
fucking chunk of money land around to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: for some medicine I get it dude I really
do get it I used to be there that's part
[SPEAKER_00]: of what started that's probably part of
what starts so many people growing this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff is so expensive and it's
questionable you pay for a product you get
[SPEAKER_00]: it home and you smoke it you're like this
doesn't taste right or this tastes like
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides or this burns like shit if you
grow it learn about it you got so much
[SPEAKER_00]: more passion and so much more quality I do
get it that's why we get going that's why
[SPEAKER_00]: I got going in this dissatisfied with
other products if it is seeded you can
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke it if it does have seeds in it it is
smokable some people I am a seed breeder I
[SPEAKER_00]: make seeded plants I make a lot of seeded
plants a lot of my shits got seeds in it
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes we'll just cut off a couple of
nuggets and we'll smoke we'll dry and cure
[SPEAKER_00]: them and we'll smoke them just to see what
the buds like I've made a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates out of seeded material we
pull the seeds out run the material
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a different buzz that happens from
seeded material there's a different
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid a different terpene a
different I don't know what it is but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: something in that plant that you can only
get from a plant that has been seeded it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a totally different buzz it is heavier and
the stony department like your body feels
[SPEAKER_00]: it but also it's more psychedelic and for
me to say psychedelic that takes a lot in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis because I have more than delved
in the world of psychedelia I know what
[SPEAKER_00]: real psychedelics are and for me to say
that weed can be psychedelic that takes
[SPEAKER_00]: something so that seeded weed can almost
bring on like a trippy vision head change
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of a thing so even if there are seeds
in there you can dry it and cure it and
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke it if you choose to do that but
making edibles making tinctures making
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever is great also so get those seeds
out of there separate those seeds I would
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend probably just tossing those
seeds some people will say they're viable
[SPEAKER_00]: you're already dealing with an intersex
issue you don't want more headaches in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion those are headache seeds those are
bird seed I would get rid of them a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people out there are raising their fist in
the air saying those are good seeds I
[SPEAKER_00]: think intersex begets intersex I would
toss them so you don't have to deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: this again in the future get that material
make the products you want to make that
[SPEAKER_00]: will work let me catch up because there is
more to this message it says I know I can
[SPEAKER_00]: still use them that way if it comes down
to having small don't grow them very big
[SPEAKER_00]: veg them for a small time get a clone from
them then flower them if you see any
[SPEAKER_00]: problems get the fuck rid of it when you
see keepers keep those and keep that clone
[SPEAKER_00]: forever create a mother plant I think I've
done podcasts on feno hunting selection
[SPEAKER_00]: and mother plants so those should help you
out I do need to find my space again it
[SPEAKER_00]: says also the main reason I messaged it
all is to ask you if you can tell if a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is actually seeded or not or do you
literally have to tear open a bud to know
[SPEAKER_00]: for sure you don't have to tear open a
giant bud and find one little tiny nugget
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere on that plant is a little just a
little shitty popcorn nugget that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: spare just pinch it just squeeze it seeds
by now if it's been a couple of weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds are starting to get hard they don't
feel like normal weed normal buds feels I
[SPEAKER_00]: almost said smells they don't feel like
normal bud would feel normally the bud
[SPEAKER_00]: would be squishy maybe spongy right now
there's a hard piece in there that is your
[SPEAKER_00]: seed if you squeeze a calyx if you squeeze
a bract you may feel there's a seed in
[SPEAKER_00]: there you could take off a little nug from
the bottom you could take up just one tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: nug you're not going to ruin the whole
crop tear it open give it a squeeze give
[SPEAKER_00]: it an investigation you may see a little
white starts of seeds you may see fully
[SPEAKER_00]: developed seeds you may have fully ripened
hardened seeds in there if so you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds to deal with and you've got a good
learning experience but you don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: destroy the whole plant just to find out
if there's a seed in there as a breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes close when I've pollinated a
plant I know it's almost time to cut it
[SPEAKER_00]: down I'll take fingers and just grab a bud
just grab a nug and pull you can pull off
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of bracts and they'll come right
off the plant and you can just roll it
[SPEAKER_00]: around in your fingers and all the
material will come off and you'll have
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds in your hand if there's seeds there
you'll definitely be able to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully if it was just a small intersect
section of your plant that showed
[SPEAKER_00]: intersects and pollinated hopefully it
didn't put out a bunch of pollen maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: just just some sprinkles and you only got
a few seeds here and there it sounds like
[SPEAKER_00]: you caught it early you started being
proactive or at least reactive to what you
[SPEAKER_00]: found maybe you didn't get a lot of seeds
in there it wasn't in there for very long
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe it was non-viable what's the word we
used maybe it was impotent like you said
[SPEAKER_00]: before maybe it didn't make any seeds
right now it's kind of just a wait-and-see
[SPEAKER_00]: game or go in there and give it a squeeze
and see but there could be depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: which part of the plant was facing the
plant that intersects maybe those two buds
[SPEAKER_00]: that were touching maybe some pollination
happened there but up top nothing happened
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed that in the greenhouse this
summer the plants that were right around
[SPEAKER_00]: the male plant that perimeter was loaded
with seeds you could walk by the plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: brush it and seeds would fall out but as
you got further from that male and
[SPEAKER_00]: circumference in the greenhouse there were
less and less seeds so depending on the
[SPEAKER_00]: how far that male was shooting his pollen
you may not have a lot of seeds or that
[SPEAKER_00]: whole plant could be busted up it's hard
to hard to guess but I'm wishing for the
[SPEAKER_00]: best for you to tell you the truth now it
says um thanks for the awesome podcast and
[SPEAKER_00]: all the knowledge you share with the army
and myself you are very welcome thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you for the great patreon question
and also the patreon support I do
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate that it says I hope you never
stop I do not have a reason to stop at
[SPEAKER_00]: this point can't stop won't stop you guys
feel my fire every day every day I wake up
[SPEAKER_00]: my inbox is filled with more great
questions and I feel like it is kind of my
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility at this point to field
those questions I've been given this gift
[SPEAKER_00]: of gab I've been given this gift to
understand the plants in a way I don't try
[SPEAKER_00]: to act like I'm some major college
professor when it comes to growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis I know the plants because I've
grown them touch them been in the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms I've got a lot of experience and I
feel if I didn't share that between the
[SPEAKER_00]: gift of gab and the the experience with
the plants something would go wrong this
[SPEAKER_00]: is my duty whatever you believe in I
believe that that inspires me to teach you
[SPEAKER_00]: how to be a good cannabis grower without
me doing that I think that I might
[SPEAKER_00]: spontaneously combust or something I would
not be doing my duty as a person so that's
[SPEAKER_00]: my job supposed to be here teaching people
how to grow I'm also supposed to be a good
[SPEAKER_00]: dad and be a good drummer and there are a
few other things I think I'm supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: do so thank you for the huge compliments
bro I do appreciate that thank you for the
[SPEAKER_00]: encouragement I never will stop and he
wraps it up by saying you've helped my
[SPEAKER_00]: game go up so far that it nearly matches
my high from my last crop of orange as I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: that's good you must be super high from
that orange asm I hope I keep stepping up

improve everybody's crop to six set
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody up for success that's harder to
say than it sounds trying to get everybody

so that people don't have to rely on
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries and free market growers if
that's where you're getting your product

you could just grow it yourself not have
[SPEAKER_00]: to meet some random person in a parking
lot at a random place at 530 and they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't show up till 6 and the product they
have isn't what you're hoping for if we
[SPEAKER_00]: could all produce our own products we
would all be self-sufficient the world
[SPEAKER_00]: would be great also we can all overgrow
