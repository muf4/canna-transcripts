[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode number 270 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_01]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who is
[SPEAKER_01]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, This My Friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_01]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks to Kat, Ku, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again for joining me, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're having a great evening,
daytime, nighttime, whatever time it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: wherever you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you're having a great one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're smoking on something
delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you got a fat joint rolled up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're taking a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just took a giant dab of some Tahoe OG
batter mixed with Pura Vida OG batter.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Tahoe OG tastes amazing, you guys,
but it just doesn't give me the high that
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of mellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of chills me out, which is cool,
but I want a little more from it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the taste is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been mixing the Tahoe OG with the
Pura Vida and taking good sized dabs of
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Pura Vida makes me forget where I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me forget what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So mixing the Pura Vida and the Tahoe,
it's a super terpy combo, super great head
[SPEAKER_01]: high, super nice body high, nice and
chilled out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm ready to do a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I hope you're smoking on something
delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's start off this podcast by
jumping right into it, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a brand new iTunes comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a rating and a review is what it is
here on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love it if you guys would leave me
some ratings and reviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way you can do so is go to iTunes,
go to the iTunes store, search for the
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow From Your Heart podcast, scroll down
about halfway, you'll see a picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a red, yellow, and green flag with my
face on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Grow From Your Heart podcast
logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Click right on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will take you to the podcast page.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the middle of that page is a spot where
it says ratings and reviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is where you are able to leave me a
rating and a review.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, everybody has left a five-star
review.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, let me scroll up some more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to the top and make sure I'm not lying
to you because there was one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what, they took down,
no, there is one four-star review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have got 77 ratings.
[SPEAKER_01]: 76 of them are five stars.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is a four-star rating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, leave me the amount of stars that
you feel I deserve and type in a little
[SPEAKER_01]: customer review and I will read your
customer review on a future episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into reading the most recent.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came in on November 29th.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's from a person who calls themselves
FarmerDan831.
[SPEAKER_01]: The headline of the customer review goes
like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best info you can find.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this is what FarmerDan831 had to
say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love your show, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got the whole crew hooked on your show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're listening to you as we harvest one
of our rooms for live resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it real, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good vibes your way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, FarmerDan, thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for getting the whole crew addicted
to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, man, thanks for putting some
live resin out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of want to know where you work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who do you work for?
[SPEAKER_01]: What company are you making live resin
for?
[SPEAKER_01]: And can I try it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to go pick up a gram somewhere
and see what you are making.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, that's the only iTunes comment
I have got for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel free to leave me more iTunes ratings
and reviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would truly appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, I want to give a huge thanks to
all of the people who have left iTunes
[SPEAKER_01]: ratings and customer reviews in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's work our way into another
topic, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a little bit not cannabis-related,
but it is internet-related.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since my podcast is an internet-based
show, I feel that this topic may or may
[SPEAKER_01]: not affect you and or I in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of wanted to bring it up on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today, the FCC officially, they
repealed net neutrality rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let me explain a little bit about what
net neutrality is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just going to read basically from
Wikipedia and tell you what Wikipedia says
[SPEAKER_01]: about net neutrality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll talk a little bit about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, net neutrality is the principle
that internet service providers must treat
[SPEAKER_01]: all data on the internet the same and not
discriminate or charge differently by
[SPEAKER_01]: user, content, website, platform,
application, type of attached equipment,
[SPEAKER_01]: or method of communication.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, under these principles,
internet service providers are unable to
[SPEAKER_01]: intentionally block, slow down,
or charge money for specific websites and
[SPEAKER_01]: online content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going to skip a little bit, and then
here's another part that's important for
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, a widely cited example of a
violation of net neutrality principles was
[SPEAKER_01]: the internet service provider Comcast
secret slowing of uploads from
[SPEAKER_01]: peer-to-peer file sharing applications by
using forged packets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Comcast did not stop blocking these
protocols like BitTorrent until the
[SPEAKER_01]: Federal Communications Commission ordered
them to stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another minor example, the Madison
River Communications Company was fined
[SPEAKER_01]: $15,000 by the FCC in 2004 for restricting
their customers access to Vonage,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was rivaling their own services.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically you guys, what net neutrality
did was made it illegal for folks like
[SPEAKER_01]: Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, or whoever else
you can think of to alter their internet
[SPEAKER_01]: service based on your usage or their
preferences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, if you live in the United
States of America and you are not in an
[SPEAKER_01]: institution and you have public internet,
your internet is wide open.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are able to look at whatever you would
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can look at AOL, you can look at
Disney, you can look at Animal Planet,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also you can go to hightimes.com and
look at Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go to your favorite adult website
and look at whatever you're into there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do whatever you want on the
internet right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: When net neutrality becomes a thing,
your internet service provider will get to
[SPEAKER_01]: decide what you may or may not look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may decide that if you want the adult
package, if your content is considered
[SPEAKER_01]: adult, if you're looking at cannabis,
if you're looking at adult themed things,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're looking at anything they feel
may be adult, they can put a surcharge on
[SPEAKER_01]: that for you and charge you money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, it's currently illegal,
but now that the restrictions have been
[SPEAKER_01]: lifted, they are going to be allowed to do
this once all of these rules and laws are
[SPEAKER_01]: worked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what concerns me is I like giving you
guys a free podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like getting my show out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to cost me more money to
upload my show because they have mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: people that use large uploads are going to
possibly have to pay for more for their
[SPEAKER_01]: internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say that people that download large
files may have to pay more for their
[SPEAKER_01]: internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is your internet service provider going to
give you podcasts for free?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is my internet service provider going to
allow me to upload these podcasts with no
[SPEAKER_01]: extra charge?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are all things we're going to have
to face here in the future and figure out
[SPEAKER_01]: what the changing of net neutrality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I'm sure a lot of companies will
rally and try to sue and hopefully
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody has a really good lawyer and they
can start a lawsuit to stop net neutrality
[SPEAKER_01]: from being lifted.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in other countries like Canada and
Chile and Brazil, it's a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all know that North Korea and China
are already limiting their internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can only see a few websites there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't access all the popular stuff
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're caught accessing it,
you are committing a crime and you will be
[SPEAKER_01]: punished.
[SPEAKER_01]: So learn what you can from the internet
right now, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get what you can because things are
changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: People can't predict what's coming because
this is a brand new thing, but things are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, most of the articles I read said
that it was going to be a couple of weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: before the changes roll out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope we don't see too drastic of a
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope we don't end up paying for simple
internet, paying more for basic internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're already paying for internet service.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to have to pay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine if they made it like a cable
package.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, you can get basic internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can check out Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could check out Animal Planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could check out all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want to go on the premium
package, it's going to be an extra 9.95 a
[SPEAKER_01]: month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine if they start doing that shit to
you and then you're not going to know what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not getting until you're not able
to get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're going to have to add that
to your package.
[SPEAKER_01]: How weird would it be to not have access
to the whole internet and not even know it
[SPEAKER_01]: because you don't know that that's there
because you can't even go to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, imagine if you had Comcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, let's even go better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine if you had AT&T as a service
provider.
[SPEAKER_01]: So AT&T is who you pay your bill to.
[SPEAKER_01]: AT&T is who your service is through.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are the ones that get to decide what
you get to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, perhaps there's something really cool
going on that is sponsored by Verizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your favorite band is doing a cool ass
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing it live feed, but it's
sponsored by Verizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck you, AT&T listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't get to watch it because you're
on a different internet and we're not even
[SPEAKER_01]: going to allow you to see the Verizon
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fuck you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going to be left out of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to be able to get to see
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your friend with an iPhone and your other
friend with an Android, you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have different internets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not going to be able to see the
same stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine this, and this is just my small
mind thinking this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a capitalist business person,
but imagine when you go to a concert.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to the Verizon Wireless Center,
the only internet that's going to work
[SPEAKER_01]: there will be Verizon internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the ads, anything from AT&T,
Comcast, Cricket, whatever else phone
[SPEAKER_01]: companies there are, I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_01]: All those other ads will be blocked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything will just be Verizon Wireless
approved content.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you go to the AT&T or the
Qualcomm Center, everything's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: filtered by them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The internet you're allowed to use on your
phone while you were in, the Verizon
[SPEAKER_01]: Wireless Center will be filtered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though you are an adult, I'm sure
they will filter it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way, nobody can be looking at any
adult shit or any band shit or something
[SPEAKER_01]: from a rivaling entity while you're in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what this is going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just the start.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a very narrow mind when it comes
to capitalizing on stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can only imagine what some folks in some
suits and some ivory towers with a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of money are trying to do to fuck us over
a little bit more right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the internet may change you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't grow up with the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to see the internet happen,
when you first heard about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're like, wait, you could put your
computer, you could plug a phone line into
[SPEAKER_01]: your computer and talk to other people on
other computers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sounds kind of fun also.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also at the same time, I was like,
I've got a phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do I want to type out a bunch of shit?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, because you can go in a
chat room and talk to like 15 different
[SPEAKER_01]: people at once and learn a bunch of cool
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh no, the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the internet went from just like
simple chat rooms to like everybody had a
[SPEAKER_01]: website and then it got interactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then social media happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Social media wasn't a thing when I was a
kid, you guys, all you youngsters.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't a real thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like grandpa telling stories right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But social media wasn't a thing when I was
young.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you wanted to find friends,
you had to fucking go somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you wanted to know what your neighbor
was doing, you had to go there and knock
[SPEAKER_01]: on the fucking door and find out what he
was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you wanted to know what your best
friend was doing, you had to call him and
[SPEAKER_01]: go, Hey Chris, what are you doing,
bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you didn't just jump on Facebook and
see what everybody was fucking bitching
[SPEAKER_01]: about all at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was way different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I saw no internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw chat rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw all of the companies get a website
and I saw everybody's websites suck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I saw everybody not have a
compatible website.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I saw websites get good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I saw everybody start openly
talking about internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Porn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just became a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then internet porn lost its funny and
its stigma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now everybody just talks about internet
porn like it's just common.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it went from like, Ooh, internet porn
to now it's just internet porn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it went to all the social media got
crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then everybody had a YouTube channel and
then the internet became what it is today.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to know something,
if you have an idea, it's on the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to watch a video about
something, if you want to see somebody do
[SPEAKER_01]: something, if you want to learn about
something, it's on the internet,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the best parts about it was
there was no limit because there was no
[SPEAKER_01]: rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could learn about things that you
should probably not be learning about,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're going to do it anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's best to learn it the best you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't fuck up, but now you won't be
able to find all those cool things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't be able to watch all that creepy
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have to pay for a different
package, but I saw it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw it when it was some creepy dark
thing that had no rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember overgrow the gov and a whole
bunch of other cannabis related websites
[SPEAKER_01]: where we used to all go tell secrets and
trade seeds and try to impress each other
[SPEAKER_01]: with our bud shots before it was safe to
just go, post your entire grow room up on
[SPEAKER_01]: Facebook and Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember it, ladies and gentlemen,
the internet will forever be different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now as a podcaster, it's my duty to do my
best to make sure that my podcast is
[SPEAKER_01]: available in as many ways as possible,
as many places as possible, as many
[SPEAKER_01]: formats as possible in case something does
happen to where people are forced to pay
[SPEAKER_01]: for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to be able to access my podcast
for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to try to stay on top of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what's going on with net
neutrality more than what I've told you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of stuff to take in.
[SPEAKER_01]: If something does happen where you are not
able to listen to my podcast for free,
[SPEAKER_01]: send me a message and we will figure
something out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I've got to send you the file,
we'll do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want everyone to be able to listen to
this podcast for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will figure out a way to get this show
out to everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my commitment to you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love podcasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love my friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love helping my friends grow better
cannabis through podcasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to keep at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to make sure you guys are able
to listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always a way around some Babylon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bullshit rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll make sure my friends get to hear
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I've been talking about net
neutrality for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to hear your comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like your input.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com
or send me a tweet at GFYH podcast on the
[SPEAKER_01]: tweeters.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's move forward a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, we are in the era of
cannabis legalization and medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana and recreational marijuana,
but just because we have rules that allow
[SPEAKER_01]: us to dispense, consume and medicate and
recreate and all of the above with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis does not mean that we can ignore
the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rules were made.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rules are in place and we have to
follow the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to read an article that I found on
the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been the talk of Colorado today.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the most popular, I can't say most
popular, a very well-known chain of
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries was rated this morning and
eight locations were rated and 11 Denver
[SPEAKER_01]: area sweet leaf stores were closed and 26
of their licenses have been suspended.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to tell you guys about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found the article well written on the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is written by Alicia Wallace from the
cannabis staff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to read the whole article.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Police raid eight sweet leaf marijuana
center locations in Denver and Aurora.
[SPEAKER_01]: All 11 Denver area sweet leaf stores are
closed and its 26 licenses have been
[SPEAKER_01]: suspended.
[SPEAKER_01]: Denver police on Thursday rated eight
sweet leaf marijuana center locations in
[SPEAKER_01]: Denver and Aurora and arrested 12 people
as part of a year long investigation into
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal marijuana sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, this dispensary was participating in,
allegedly, I have to say allegedly,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not part of the investigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't prove shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Allegedly, this dispensary was illegally
selling cannabis, which could include a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the article doesn't tell us what they
may have been doing, I will let you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: know what I feel like may have been
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The criminal activities alleged include
sale of cannabis in violation of the one
[SPEAKER_01]: ounce per person per day limits
established under Colorado marijuana law,
[SPEAKER_01]: Denver police officials said in a
statement.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so in Colorado, a recreational
cannabis shopper is allowed to buy one
[SPEAKER_01]: ounce per person per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I did not know that it said per day
because there are some dispensaries that
[SPEAKER_01]: will let you come back later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously sweet leaf was letting too many
people do that and they've gotten
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm gonna say it right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you work for a dispensary, it says
clearly right here, one ounce per person
[SPEAKER_01]: per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that Ricardo or let's see who
wrote this article again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that Alicia Wallace knows all
of the laws and rules on cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it looks like that's what got this
place in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if your dispensary is selling,
is letting a customer shop, drive to
[SPEAKER_01]: another dispensary and then come back to
your store or visit within the same day,
[SPEAKER_01]: you are breaking the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check with your compliance officer,
check with your management and see if this
[SPEAKER_01]: is a practice that should not be happening
in your store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it is, you may wanna consider
cutting that off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not gonna call out any dispensaries
that have done it, but there are several
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational dispensaries that will allow
you to come back multiple times in the
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're not gonna do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys stop that one visit per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise it looks sketchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are rules in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: These people are getting in trouble for
breaking them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're allowed to buy one ounce per
person per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now the criminal activities allege
that these folks were violating that rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Denver Police Department of Excise and
License, in concert with the police
[SPEAKER_01]: action, suspended 26 licenses for medical,
retail, cultivation and extraction
[SPEAKER_01]: operations that conduct business as suite
leave, said Dan Rowland, spokesman for the
[SPEAKER_01]: Excise and License Department.
[SPEAKER_01]: The suspension order stated, reasonable
grounds and probable cause exists to
[SPEAKER_01]: believe that respondents have engaged in
deliberate and willful violations of state
[SPEAKER_01]: and local laws or regulations and or that
the public health, safety and welfare
[SPEAKER_01]: requires emergency action.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point in the articles I'm
scrolling through, there's a picture of
[SPEAKER_01]: the door at suite leaf with a nice little
handwritten note that says, sorry,
[SPEAKER_01]: we are closed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a very well printed letter from,
it's hard to read because it's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: small.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, City and County of Denver
Department of Excise and Taxes with the
[SPEAKER_01]: big Denver official logo, notice of
suspension in bright red.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the following text is in black.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says medical and or retail marijuana
licenses for these premises have been
[SPEAKER_01]: suspended by order of the Denver
Department of Excise and Licenses for
[SPEAKER_01]: alleged Colorado or for alleged violations
of Colorado law.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is prominently displayed on the
front door at suite leaf dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is the location at 2609 Walnut
Street is where this photo came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Alex who took the photo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I cannot pronounce your last name,
but I'll give you some credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool photo.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's gonna be legendary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good shot, Alex.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the article goes on to say like this,
all suite leaf stores in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 in Denver and one in Aurora were closed
Thursday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Names of the 12 people arrested were not
immediately released.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were being booked into the downtown
detention center.
[SPEAKER_01]: Police said the operation was conducted
after a criminal investigation into the
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal distribution of marijuana at eight
locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: The alleged criminal violations were
related to the sale of marijuana in excess
[SPEAKER_01]: of allowable amounts established by
amendment 64, which allows for the
[SPEAKER_01]: personal use of marijuana according to
police department news release.
[SPEAKER_01]: No other marijuana businesses were
included in the raids, the police said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Suite leaf representatives said in an
emailed statement that they were surprised
[SPEAKER_01]: by police raids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is unclear at this point exactly what
actions if any suite leaf took to cause
[SPEAKER_01]: the city to issue this order, the
statement said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Suite leaf is cooperating with the
authorities to resolve this issue and
[SPEAKER_01]: hopes to have all of their stores back in
operation as soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not immediately clear to what
extent suite leafs facilities were
[SPEAKER_01]: affected beyond Denver and Aurora.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although the Aurora store was raided and
no one answered the location's phone on
[SPEAKER_01]: Thursday, the city has not suspended suite
leafs business license for its East 6th
[SPEAKER_01]: Avenue store, said Julie Patterson,
an Aurora sports spokeswoman.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are waiting to receive more information
from police investigators to determine
[SPEAKER_01]: whether we need to take any action.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, imagine being an employee at that
store.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just a sitting duck shaking all day
like fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they coming?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they coming?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they coming?
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet some people are not going to work
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, yeah, we might be open,
but I'm not showing the fuck up for my
[SPEAKER_01]: shift.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't go to work tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm done with like worrying about
police raids and shit and worrying about
[SPEAKER_01]: cops and someone kicking in the door,
going to jail, doing shit legit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work for a legitimate company that
doesn't do stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not fucking show up for work
tomorrow if I worked at the East 6th
[SPEAKER_01]: Avenue location.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be taking a sick day like a
motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can already tell my throat sounds like
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not be at work tomorrow if this
was me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, now let's continue with the
article.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says suite leaves dispensary in
Portland, Oregon remained open.
[SPEAKER_01]: A person who answered the store's phone
said the employee said store officials
[SPEAKER_01]: declined to comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: The coordinated enforcement action was
solely a Colorado agency effort headed by
[SPEAKER_01]: Denver police, which partnered with the
Aurora Police Department, Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana Enforcement Division,
Denver District Attorney's Office,
[SPEAKER_01]: Denver City Attorney's Office,
Denver Department of Excise and Licenses,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Denver Department of Public Health.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of people to have come and
knocking on your door.
[SPEAKER_01]: The US Drug Enforcement Administration was
not involved in the operation,
[SPEAKER_01]: spokesman Randy Ladd said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they list all the suite leaf
locations that were raided.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just in case you're interested,
1474 South Acoma, 2647 West 38th,
[SPEAKER_01]: 5100 West 38th, 4400 East Evans,
2609 Walnut Street, 4125 North Elati,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I said that right,
ELATI Street, and 7200 East Smith Road.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was right, right in my assumption,
they were selling more cannabis than they
[SPEAKER_01]: should have been selling to each customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys check this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are not from Colorado, or even if
you are from Colorado and you go to a
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary and you're that guy that's
like, and you're shopping recreationally
[SPEAKER_01]: or even medically, and you're asking
somebody to bend or break a rule,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you are a dick because they won't
break the rules because they are a
[SPEAKER_01]: well-trained, trustworthy employee,
this is why they are not breaking the
[SPEAKER_01]: rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys lost eight dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, I want to scroll up and read
how many licenses they lost because it was
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eight places got raided, 11 stores were
closed, and 26 licenses have been
[SPEAKER_01]: suspended because somebody in this company
said that it was okay to break rules and
[SPEAKER_01]: create major violations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the whole company is being shut down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody from the growers, to the
trimmers, to the budtenders, to the
[SPEAKER_01]: managers, to the CEOs, they're all on hold
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There might not be a business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody knows what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody knows what's going on with these
licenses until they have their hearings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually these hearings happen within,
I think it's about 30 days, they have to
[SPEAKER_01]: be heard and everybody goes to court and
talks about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But until this happens, the growers don't
know where their paycheck comes from.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trimmers don't know where their
paycheck comes from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's in a scramble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they got greedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tried to make extra money.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tried to break some rules and all
they did was totally fuck themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: 26 licenses, you guys, licenses are not
cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you fuck up with the license and they
find out, they find that you were
[SPEAKER_01]: incapable of properly handling a license
and conducting business like an adult,
[SPEAKER_01]: they will take your fucking license from
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know what happens to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sell it or you have to sell it to
somebody else or something, but you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed to hold a marijuana license,
a business license for any type of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis related business anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows what's going to happen with
these businesses?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are budtenders that are not at work.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one location open tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know that those employees are
going to want to go to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're probably paranoid and worried.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's a whole company shut down,
millions of dollars, you guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: millions of dollars, millions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't even fathom how many millions
of dollars come with 26 licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they say eight sweet leaf marijuana
center locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's eight locations shut down,
but there are 26 licenses, which means
[SPEAKER_01]: there are eight dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are probably 10 grows that puts you
at 18 and then like maybe eight MIPS,
[SPEAKER_01]: which would be where they make edibles or
where they make concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: MIPS is medically infused products is what
that license is, MIP.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where you can do extractions.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all specialized.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's either a kitchen or a lab or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, they probably had eight
dispensaries, 10 grows that puts you at
[SPEAKER_01]: 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then however, whatever else I said,
eight more would be MIPS or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just guessing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what they really are,
but 26 licenses have been taken away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many people are going to be fucked,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you go to the dispensary and the
budtender won't break the rules or won't
[SPEAKER_01]: bend the rules or won't sell you extra or
won't hook you up or you don't have the
[SPEAKER_01]: proper idea and they tell you,
no, this is why you guys, we would like to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep our businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would like to be employed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the middle of December.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now there are a bunch of people that
we're probably counting on that next
[SPEAKER_01]: paycheck that they're going to make over
the next week to cover some Christmas
[SPEAKER_01]: gifts, to cover something.
[SPEAKER_01]: People already spent money, I'm sure,
because it's Christmas time and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't plan ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just spend money that we don't have
because the TV tells us that it's okay
[SPEAKER_01]: because just spend that money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet you they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now these people are going to be fucked
because they don't have a job.
[SPEAKER_01]: So stop breaking the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop asking people to break rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look, here's an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are rules in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not just, it's not the Wild West
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: For you people that may think we're just
out here slinging dope and nobody cares,
[SPEAKER_01]: there are rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doors got kicked in, licenses were taken
away, people are in jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I've got one more little piece
I want to add to this before I wrap up
[SPEAKER_01]: this segment of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was from The Westward, which is,
if you're not from Colorado, The Westward
[SPEAKER_01]: is like a little local paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the hip cool color paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: With all the ads in it and all the local
stuff, it tells you about all the cool
[SPEAKER_01]: shows coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tells you about all the art that's
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the back three pages are all ads
and coupons for dispensaries in Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they put out a great magazine,
I think monthly, and they also have a
[SPEAKER_01]: website.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Sweetleaf sent them a message and it's
an official assertion from corporate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Westward posted it and it says,
This morning, Sweetleaf was surprised to
[SPEAKER_01]: receive notification from the Department
of Excise and License suspending all of
[SPEAKER_01]: our city licenses in the city and county
of Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is unclear at this point exactly what
actions, if any, Sweetleaf took to cause
[SPEAKER_01]: the city to issue this order.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweetleaf is cooperating with the
authorities to resolve this issue and
[SPEAKER_01]: hopes to have all of their stores back in
operation as soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it said that they were cooperating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course they're cooperating.
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 people are in jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm curious, are those people owners,
are they corporate?
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been researching everything I can
find so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time of this recording,
the people arrested have not been
[SPEAKER_01]: processed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are still in booking in the Denver
jail, the Denver, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Denver city, Denver County jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still being processed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't find any information on who it
was.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm curious about is were they bud
tenders?
[SPEAKER_01]: Were they management?
[SPEAKER_01]: Were they owners?
[SPEAKER_01]: Were they, where were they in the food
chain of the company?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because honestly, I don't know,
I know there is a rule in place and I have
[SPEAKER_01]: to ask, we got to get White Mike in on
this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a rule that says if somebody
commits a crime in the dispensary,
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's either the management's
responsibility or the actual, like if a
[SPEAKER_01]: bud tender sells somebody illegally,
I think the bud tender can actually
[SPEAKER_01]: legally be held responsible, but I'm not
certain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the bud tenders may be the ones
detained.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I find out, I will let you guys know
on a future episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so I took a second and
contacted a compliance officer who knows a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot about the marijuana enforcement
division rules and regulations and they
[SPEAKER_01]: told me, yes, if a bud tender is caught
violating a rule, they will be arrested
[SPEAKER_01]: and charged, but they also stated they
doubt that's what happened in this case.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said there's more to this case that
they can't talk about right now and they
[SPEAKER_01]: will talk to me in person because we were
just texting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're an insider.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll find out some stuff and then I'll see
what I can share with you, but it is not
[SPEAKER_01]: what it looks like is what I can say after
reading that whole article and then
[SPEAKER_01]: talking with my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't appear to be what it looks
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a different thing than what I
thought and what the reporters have all
[SPEAKER_01]: said so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll find out if there's anything else
I can share with you guys and then I will
[SPEAKER_01]: let you know as soon as I've got some more
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I'm running out of time and my
throat is starting to get a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: funky, but I want to read one email and
then we're going to wrap up this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there wasn't a whole lot of very
specific cannabis education this time,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the theme of the show is cannabis
news, education and conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got some news and conversation for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the last episode was very,
education based.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're evening shit out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so this email goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, hey, Jeff, been a long time
listener of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much good information to learn from and
I appreciate you putting it out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on to say, the reason I'm writing
is I would like to possibly get ahold of
[SPEAKER_01]: some of your seeds and was wondering if
you could shoot me in the direction as to
[SPEAKER_01]: where to find some.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Google the Hella Dank Seed Company or
go to dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you will be able to find seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you type in Hella Dank Seed Bank,
I read genetics, you will be golden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hella Dank Seed Bank is the place I
recommend today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can always check my friends out at
the dankteam.com, the dank, D-A-N-K team
[SPEAKER_01]: .com, the dankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check Hella Dank Seed Bank or the dankteam
.com are two great places to get I read
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: The email goes on to say, I will be road
tripping around Colorado in a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So destination is not much of a concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: When did you write this?
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a while ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: That trip already happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you had a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize for missing you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going through old emails and
catching up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says specifically, I would like to find
some lemon Jeffrey, golden goat,
[SPEAKER_01]: or a rise.
[SPEAKER_01]: The arise is available.
[SPEAKER_01]: The golden goat won't be available for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lemon Jeffrey is not available by
itself, but it is available in the form of
[SPEAKER_01]: lemon sunrise, which is lemon Jeffrey
crossed to the arise.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's available at the dankteam and
the Hella Dank Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: The email goes on to say, I know you
recently mentioned that you don't care to
[SPEAKER_01]: mess with feminine seeds, but if there are
any feminine seeds of these strains
[SPEAKER_01]: floating around, I would like to get my
hands on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no more golden goat or lemon
Jeffrey feminine seeds available right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That may change in the future,
but currently that's not a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: A rise is currently not available in a
feminized seed form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no feminine seeds right now from me,
although I will be making a new line of
[SPEAKER_01]: feminine seeds very soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to reverse a female plant and
turn it into a male.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to pollinate a few things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will test run those.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I like what comes out of those,
I will do it again and put it into
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was asked to do a favor for somebody
because they really liked a strain and
[SPEAKER_01]: they wanted to play with seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am going to make S1s of a strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll talk about it a little more in the
future, but that's what I'm doing with
[SPEAKER_01]: feminine seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a whole new plant that I'm going
to be reversing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to make a whole new line of
femme stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will only be about four or five
crosses in the whole line, but those will
[SPEAKER_01]: be coming in a little bit here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get back to this email and
get my brain back focused.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, I hope to hear back from you and
keep up the good work on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll keep up the good work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize for taking forever to get back
to you with the emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a lot of emails, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: The email goes on to say, I lost my space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is by far one of my top three right
alongside Joe Rogan experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in the top three right alongside Joe
Rogan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who else is up there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know who number three is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Joe Rogan, myself, and who else do
you have up there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, it's an honor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time somebody compares me to Joe
Rogan in podcasting or in any way,
[SPEAKER_01]: shape or form, it's a fucking honor
because Joe Rogan is an amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: That man's a savage.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's never an insult to be compared to
Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for that huge compliment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that my podcast is one of your
favorites right alongside Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I listen to Joe Rogan kind of religiously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rogan puts out three, sometimes four or
five shows every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I listen to almost every second of
every show that that guy puts out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of my favorite podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad you dig it with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad we're probably listening to the
Joe Rogan experience together sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: during long days at work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, thanks for the huge compliment.
[SPEAKER_01]: He also says, PS, you should do more
organic episodes on organic growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's not your thing, but I'm sure
many listeners would enjoy hearing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I would love to get more organic
episodes going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to schedule some more organic based
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just been chaotic lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: My schedule is hard to nail down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other people are hard to nail down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to reach out to some folks and have
them come be on the podcast and talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The email finishes up like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if this makes it on your show,
please don't mention my name.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, dude, I won't mention your
name, but I do want to give you a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: thanks for sending me a great email,
for letting me ramble on about getting
[SPEAKER_01]: some seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope your trip to Colorado was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize for not linking up with you
and dude, huge thanks for the comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love hearing that I'm somebody's
favorite podcast, but saying that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: right alongside the Joe Rogan experience
never gets old.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, if you want to send
me an email, I would love to hear from
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know, I may read your email on a
