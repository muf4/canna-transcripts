[SPEAKER_02]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back podcast world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is time for episode 560 of the grow
from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're watching the video, I'm sure you
can see that my buddy white Mike is
[SPEAKER_02]: joining us for another episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks man.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey Mike, we usually start the show by
talking about what we're smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's jump right into what you're
smoking today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diving right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some halo live batting from our
friends over at Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how delicious that looks.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it smell, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little floral, a little spicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like everything about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had some of the halo.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've talked about it on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you describe the flavor?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was trying to give you room to
talk, but it's a lemony gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's totally fair.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dish soap and diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a pleasant dish soap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dish soap isn't probably a real pleasant
description, but it's got that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a sweetness, a cilantro almost
that comes through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glad you agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice and tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really easy to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That packs a punch every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to our friends at Green Dot
Labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since you were kind enough to ask,
I am smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took a dab of a beautiful combo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was kind of a smartass here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got some bananas foster live batter
and I've also got honey banana full
[SPEAKER_02]: spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to go full banana on this bad
bitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I took a little scoop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took it like a three quarters of a
normal size dab of both of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was still bigger than a normal dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Took a big chunky dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a nice blend of the batter and the
full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: And bro, it was fucking bananas.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a really nice dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one is described as the flavor is
banana and sugar and oatmeal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other is frosted banana pastry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a banana runs candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or sometimes when I get those cheap,
when I used to eat those like cheap like a
[SPEAKER_02]: zingers or something, they got a lot of
vanilla flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It almost had that sort of a sweet vanilla
banana pastry.
[SPEAKER_02]: The frosting, that cream cheese frosting
on the top, it had that in there as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really good flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was a nice combo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really glad I decided to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, it punched me right in the face.
[SPEAKER_02]: That combo was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something about banana turps, banana OG,
banana kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something potent about that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't ever breed the banana stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are people out there that are
already doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the banana turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: They really work well for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not around enough and they're
often overlooked and forgotten.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't think about banana turps
until it's in front of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm like, oh, I do want that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like banana bread, bananas foster,
honey banana.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always love the banana.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we forget.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to the banana turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been enjoying a lot of honey banana
stuff lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Concentrates or just other things in your
world?
[SPEAKER_02]: Concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concentrates.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They made a lot of that full spectrum
extract and I bought a lot of it at that
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensary down from near where we live.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been enjoying the shit out of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some from apothecary and some from
green dot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was fun to bounce it back and
forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always nice having variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: Variety is the spice of life and the two
companies make their products.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same extraction methods
basically, but it's like art.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their SOPs are just this much different
possibly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, if one of them does something
just a little bit different, the product
[SPEAKER_02]: comes out so vastly different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love that availability here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

[SPEAKER_02]: so it spreads.

[SPEAKER_02]: We got Seeds Here Now covered.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, you got anything you want to ramble
about or should we jump right into these
[SPEAKER_02]: Patreon questions and cover some business?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into the first email,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to leave you plenty of space.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no, let's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just about to pass you the fucking
ramble pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got the hall pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got something on your white mic
mind, I want to hear it, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got something you want to side rant
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking that's what you're here for.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what the people love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concentrate's been stellar in Colorado
lately, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had so much good product in front of
me lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just been fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's helping make COVID a hell of a lot
easier to handle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get to go to comedy shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can vamp on that all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a dab if you'd like to, but I
understand your stance on camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need to turn your camera off,
take a dab, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: We won't laugh at you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to totally vamp on what you're
saying because I love this topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't go to comedy shows anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: There aren't comedy shows to go to.
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite things to do are comedy shows
and concerts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are the first things that we
cannot do right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm kind of going stir crazy in my
mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love being out with the people and
fucking laughing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you listen to the show from the
beginning, I've talked about comedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tapered it off because I feel like
I'm rubbing it in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't care too much about every
fucking comedy show I go to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've made friends with the people at
the comedy clubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've made friends with comedians.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my point is I'm not doing that anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going fucking stir crazy and I can
only buy so much clothes and shoes online.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels good to have a package show up
every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now I don't get to wear that shit
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a new pair of shoes for every day of
the fucking month.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got new pants for every day of the
month.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a fresh new shirt for every episode
of the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only thing I'm wearing it on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got new shoes on right now just because
I can't fucking wear them anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing I'm blowing all my
money on, bro, since we're not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: shows, is all these delicious
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoever is stuck in the lab all day is
just cranking it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, oh, I'm bored.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to go out and get COVID.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's make a bunch of fresh new flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're looking like me now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to lift weights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so much fun right now in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel for people in other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how the fuck people in
Arkansas are handling this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The further you are from legalization,
man, just- Moonshine, buddy, moonshine.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how they're doing it in Arkansas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just guessing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just brutal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel for y'all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really, really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I could do this without
really good herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I would- I'd have lost it already.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was getting a throat tickle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that the first thing I need to
do when I start getting a throat tickle is
[SPEAKER_02]: hydrate and minimize my consumption of
smoke, just dabs and hot smoke over the
[SPEAKER_02]: throat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a 36 hour stretch without taking a
dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a couple of people that were close to
me, they're like, you haven't dabbed all
[SPEAKER_02]: day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, I feel fucking good,
but I feel weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really would like to dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I did finally take that dab,
bro, it was like a good kick to the
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking dick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got so lit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I started getting that like,
I'm bored.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not into- I can't, if you know me,
you know, I can't sit there and watch TV.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't shut the fuck up long enough to
watch a commercial.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not like I'm just bouncing around with
nothing now.
[SPEAKER_02]: My backup plan is to get dabbed and chill
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't do that for 36 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was kind of like fidgety.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, these dabs keep us kind of calmed
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing though, bro, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I really stepped up my game on and my
garden looks even better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: My grow looks fucking, it's sexy right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything is right on track where I want
it to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants look the way I want them to
look.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like everything is where I expect it to
be.
[SPEAKER_02]: That, you know, that corner, you don't
grow cause you got the kids and all that,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you've worked in commercial grows and
you know, there's always one corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always a corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Needs to be swept and needs to just clean
that fucking corner out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That corner got cleaned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID took away all the excuses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I mean, there's always, there's
always something else you could be doing
[SPEAKER_00]: or should be doing or, or need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's easy to put off the whatever
can absolutely wait till tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get down the road a little bit,
but COVID took all those fucking excuses
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not at work, you're at home.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that's part of what sucks
about COVID is enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: The phone rings and you press ignore.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're basically just saying, fuck you to
whoever called us.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know you're home.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not doing shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's COVID time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's fucking just sitting there on the
couch, scrolling, looking for new shoes
[SPEAKER_02]: online or now I've got the good excuse.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was recording.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the phone turned off.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was recording a podcast,
I wasn't able to get to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the, we built a COVID guard,
three raised flower beds out back that all
[SPEAKER_00]: veggies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a big bed full of corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a bed full of squash and zucchini,
a bed full of peas, bed full of broccoli.
[SPEAKER_02]: When does the corn come up bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the zucchini and squash was so
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The squash and zucchini are kicking out
like mad right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The peas just started the, to really
sprout.
[SPEAKER_00]: The corn here should be in a couple of
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, it's starting to look like
it's getting ready to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just been going up so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: No flowers as it were.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got like stupid lucky with the dirt or
some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many veggies, but that that's helped
fill a lot of COVID hours too.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You delivered me a nice basket of veggies,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't eat all of that shit yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gave me so much that I still haven't
eaten it, but I chopped some of it into
[SPEAKER_02]: like little diced cubes and cooked it up
with some vegetable oil and put a little
[SPEAKER_02]: seasoning on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Serve that next to a warm sour to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next to a cold salad is a nice little
contrast and compliment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really good, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some corn next to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been doing fried zucchini,
like little sauteed zucchini, getting
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to try the zucchini bread.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be zucchini pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time we do a garden, dude,
we get way too much zucchini.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't under plant that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like even if you only put three seeds in
the ground, you're going to end up with a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred pounds of zucchini.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're not even like farmer John,
you're a fucking heavy white guy and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're out there just gardening,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife really wanted this spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was like, if we're really going to be
trapped in the house all summer,
[SPEAKER_00]: we got to have stuff to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do a garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a lot of work getting them
prepped and getting them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the watering system we built has just
been kicking all kinds of ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us about your watering system,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good thing to talk about on a
cannabis podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with cannabis, the drip systems that
you and I have built, usually each plant
[SPEAKER_00]: gets its own special dripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that leads to a lot of fucking
headaches just because you got to check
[SPEAKER_00]: each one of them little tips every goddamn
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the system we built for my garden,
like it's just veggies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each corn stalk doesn't need to get the
same amount of water every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just need to saturate the soil there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've just got big emitters like you'd
put for a yard or a flower bed or
[SPEAKER_00]: something in the corners of the boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't even do all four corners.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did on the two square boxes,
I've got diagonals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like one in the front right and one in
the back left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the long rectangle box,
I've got two corners on one side and a big
[SPEAKER_00]: 180 shoot in the middle on the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems to be covering everything
100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of veggies we're getting out of
this thing is fucking ridiculous,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: They taste good.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were really sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, really sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got like nine yellow squash in my
kitchen right now that we've harvested
[SPEAKER_00]: over the last couple days that we haven't
managed to eat or give away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're harvesting six or seven more
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is off seeds we got at Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's not even special stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank God we did it, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not even farmer John out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just some normal dude that doesn't
really have like, you know, you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking licking your finger and checking
the wind and shit every day and just out
[SPEAKER_02]: there doing what you know how to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fire up my morning coffee and while I'm
drinking my morning coffee, I go stare at
[SPEAKER_00]: it like I'm doing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just gets me away from the kids while I
get half a cup of coffee in me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I get out there with the kids for
like half an hour in the evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we pull weeds and pick veggies that
are ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a great little time killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a cool experience for the kids too.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're bringing food in from their yard
that they grew that you guys made.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they get to have it for dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's to see a process.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually get to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, I'm gigantic people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm six, three, 250 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm being nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't squeeze through some of the corn
and shit or like tiptoe through some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the stuff and they can, they're tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's been really helpful too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've got a little tiny helper bots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little bots, little useful Opa Loompas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think I do want some dab buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty rambly already.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's perfect, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of was hoping that we could kind of
turn it into a ramble cast because they
[SPEAKER_02]: do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been pretty intensive lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything has just been fucking lesson,
lesson, learn, learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been intense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna hit a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shows have been really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You talk for like seven seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take a dab and then I'll cover you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds good to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll wait on the heat net then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really liked the last couple of
episodes on safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the cannabis forums I've been
reading lately, you can tell that people
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't thought all the way through their
grow setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've thought about, I want to grow
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've thought about maybe where
they're going to get the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or which light they're going to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they haven't thought about all of the
steps all the way to the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they haven't thought about planting or
transplanting or cloning, harvesting,
[SPEAKER_00]: which hours of the day they're going to
run their lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, during the summer right now,
I saw like 130 in Death Valley might be a
[SPEAKER_00]: world record.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegas right now is breaking all kinds of
records.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're running your grow lights
during the day right now, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Lordy, you're fighting yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: 142 degrees in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't think to wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can just run them from night to morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like plant don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it don't have to be to work the next
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can run it on whatever schedule you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just learn, taking the time to really
think through all the steps, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: drying here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know so many people that I'm in,
you spend a ton of money on good equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: and good grow lights and good nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you invest all the time to get your
plant to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they throw it in a cardboard box
or stick it in an oven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how many times have we seen that,
bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to run a shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got everybody bring in everything to
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they would tell us what they did.
[SPEAKER_02]: They thought they were cool by doing dumb
tricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little different this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we set it on the door,
the oven and turn the oven on 400 for
[SPEAKER_00]: three hours instead of letting it dry and
cure for two.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember that kid's name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I do remember his name.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember his dad's name now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the LA confidential.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's not go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's not have too many details,
but yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, but that was the strain, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're thinking of the same kid,
same family.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was from 10, 12 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we still remember this pound of ruined
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The safety episode, Mike, honestly,
that safety episode came from working in
[SPEAKER_02]: multiple commercial facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know my history and commercial grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been in enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've managed a few.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been a grunt in a few.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've consulted for countless.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a comment on YouTube about
somebody bending over with scissors in
[SPEAKER_00]: their pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spit a little soda out when I read that
because I've driven that kid to the
[SPEAKER_00]: hospital twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the kid that made the comment,
but some younger person working for me who
[SPEAKER_00]: put scissors in their damn pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forgot about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stabbed themselves half an hour later
with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how I put that episode
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen the shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been in countless grows around
countless growers and I've seen hungover
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen stone people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen sober people in a hurry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people clearing wood chippers
with broom handles, broom handles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen, I've seen a lot of crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how I know like you're going to
cut yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to stub your toe.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to fucking spray a chemical
in your eye one day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to fucking.
You're going to say.
Or maybe you're going to put a rag inside
your eye.
You're going to be like and do you ever
see something like this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you ever see two guys hold a two-by-six
and another guy walk on the two-by-six to
[SPEAKER_00]: change a light bulb?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: You ever seen a guy put a ladder on a
scissor lift and raise the scissor lift to
[SPEAKER_02]: get up high enough to get to that fucking
light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've we've seen and done a lot of crazy
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That we probably shouldn't even admit to
having seen or done in a commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come in in the morning and the 300 pound
carbon filter is smashed on the floor,
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 feet below where it was hanging when
you left in the last night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big old ring of carbon around it and
fucking like 12 plants in a tray just
[SPEAKER_02]: smashed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snakes and light shields.
[SPEAKER_02]: Birds and fucking exhaust fans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Squirrels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if you were going to
mention your finger in the fan on that
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode's about safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh, he's going to tell the
finger story.
[SPEAKER_02]: You made me think about something I wanted
to add to the safety episode and it just
[SPEAKER_02]: totally fucking left my head because there
were so many good thoughts happening,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it may come to me or maybe I'll just
watch this episode and rethink about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that happens in fucking random
grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, we've had some crazy shit
happen, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: The squirrel that chewed on the fucking
big cable outside and killed the power to
[SPEAKER_02]: the whole fucking building.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we went outside and found a squirrel
that was as stiff as my fucking big pen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like from head to toe, that squirrel was
barbecued and just stiff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we've seen some weird shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rattlesnakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a grow fucking 15 minutes from here
where we found multiple fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: rattlesnakes outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had another grow where we found
tarantulas inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: A bunch of crazy shit used to happen at
some of these commercial grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lizards was common.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, lizards.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't even bother anybody after a
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's another lizard just running
them outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens when the CO2 tank that's like
eight feet tall blows a seal and dumps
[SPEAKER_00]: your whole new CO2 delivery out in like an
hour?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can walk it outside one day and I'm at
the front of a long building.
[SPEAKER_00]: The building's half a city block.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm in the front of the building and I
hear, and I go, that's a curious sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I start walking towards it and it
gets louder and louder and louder and
[SPEAKER_00]: louder and louder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at a certain point I can't hear
anymore because the sound's so oppressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's blocking out other sounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can walk it around and there's this nice
fog emitting from the back of the
[SPEAKER_00]: building.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's money flying out of that canister.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so hard to plan for all the shit
you're going to run into when you grow
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well then what happened that day was,
so we have big canisters outside of the
[SPEAKER_02]: building.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a truck filth comes up and hooks up a
line and fills those canisters with CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't have to move canisters all the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The machine should have been 10 or 14
days.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy fell asleep in his truck,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he froze the line because CO2 is a
cold gas that froze the lines and it
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when he disconnected, everything was
frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also froze the lines inside the grow
and it was just spitting CO2 in all the
[SPEAKER_02]: grow rooms at a ridiculous rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The alarms went off in the building.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to evacuate the building and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty ridiculous.
Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen walls collapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people put up too much weight and
it was just a cheap little cardboard,
[SPEAKER_00]: or not cardboard, drywall over plywood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you never know what you're going to run
into folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Safety first, then teamwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put fucking scissors in your pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put scissors in your pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've taken plenty of people to the
emergency room for dumb, dumb things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pesticide exposure was my least favorite
to go to the hospital for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because every time you walk in,
you're like, I'm a manager at a
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation facility and this employee has
a pesticide exposure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something goes off in everybody that's
like, we need to contaminate you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're always like, no, no,
no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always got to explain.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got hit yesterday with the pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: He sees a rat.
He says his feet got mashed.
Like that's all you're going to do.
That's all you're going to do is cover
your feet with grief.
And then he's like, sorry, I've got me
with a lot of dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I was going to give you guys the new
brush today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't even in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the only sprayer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not contaminated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have, always have to talk fast to get us
out of that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like yeah, if one of the Grotex went and
just went by themselves and said it,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they'd probably end up in a decon
unit, fucking rock down and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've seen too many of our friends get
steroid shots and fucking, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: what's that pill called that they give you
Claritin or the other one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, when you're all, yeah, they give you a
steroid shot and some Claritin or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they go, good luck.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fuck dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look like a tiger on one side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tiger stripe rash is no joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: First time you see that you freak the fuck
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second time you see that you freak out
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one that starts like,
uh, the tiger stripes get ridges that
[SPEAKER_02]: start bleeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when you're like, Oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never had that, but I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a guy, I don't know how much we're
allowed to talk about this because of
[SPEAKER_02]: HIPAA and all that shit, but in one case I
saw a person, uh, yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but I saw a person, uh, get exposed to
a pesticide rash and like, he messaged me
[SPEAKER_02]: that evening.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, Hey bro, I think it worked
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I may have got something.
[SPEAKER_02]: He sent me a picture, a little red spot on
his skin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, bro, document that,
keep an eye on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll check on it in the morning at work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I checked on him as soon as we got to
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see your little rash bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like starting to, he was,
he's dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was starting to turn even darker
than him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, that doesn't look good,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna have to check on that at the
first break at the first break.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had started growing like up his rib
cage and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, yeah, I think by lunch
we're taking you to the hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by lunch, I go, come here,
let me see that take a marker and draw
[SPEAKER_00]: around the outside of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no need for the marker because
by lunch fucking from his kneecap to his
[SPEAKER_02]: collarbone, he looked like somebody had
clawed him or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the doctor said that that pesticide
that he was exposed to was heat activated.
[SPEAKER_02]: The heat in his body was making him get a
worse rash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were working on a grow and we were
long sleeves and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he was definitely, but yeah,
so you got to funk you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just happened within 12,
24 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: It went from, oh, that kind of looks like
you may have got some, got a boo-boo from
[SPEAKER_02]: some pesticides to, oh fuck, get in the
car.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were taking you to the hospital,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, they gave him whatever that
pill is, Claritin, or that doesn't sound
[SPEAKER_02]: right, but they gave him something like
that and some steroids and told him,
[SPEAKER_02]: good luck, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The eye wash was a really good,
really good tip too.
[SPEAKER_00]: The really common that I saw is you take a
dirty trichome coated fingers to get your
[SPEAKER_00]: eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your eye or it's your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next thing you know, new tremors
in the side of the room, crying a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, what happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you touched your eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing I've seen people make
mistakes on, and this is what I forgot a
[SPEAKER_02]: moment ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to interrupt you and just
fucking blast this one out is,
[SPEAKER_02]: and this is common in a commercial,
and it's a bad mistake.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's illegal by the health department.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's illegal by the department of ag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep your beverages away from your other
stuffs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in the commercial cultivation,
it's not uncommon to have isopropyl
[SPEAKER_02]: alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd have isopropyl alcohol, pH up,
pH down, Dr. Pepper, fucking like,
[SPEAKER_02]: wait, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you're stoned, like, cause you work
in the grow and you're fucking going a
[SPEAKER_02]: million miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm talking to you and I'm like,
all right, Mike, I got to get this job
[SPEAKER_02]: done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to fuck, yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You all know, I'll go to lunch after I
water room B.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's the isopropyl alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was close.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me grab my Dr. Pepper over here,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just take a drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I need a drink of this kombucha cause
I just Pavlov my mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were soaking those spray emitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned a while back that clog easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were soaking those in a caustic cleaner
in someone who wasn't typically in that
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were looking for something and they
moved the container that those were
[SPEAKER_00]: soaking in and it didn't have a lid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just had a, I think it was a piece of
tape over the top that said, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't touch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It said what it was on actually said what
it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I remember this very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know exactly the person.
[SPEAKER_00]: They splashed it on their hand and ended
up with a chemical burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, like five minutes later,
they came up to us and we're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: why is my hand like red and itchy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it stinging?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually zero tall on their hand
was turning white and puffy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the skin was kind of dying a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: See Jeff was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember exactly the day in that purse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause they tried to, they're like,
what do I do?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, don't, don't fuck around
because they were fucking around.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why they got hurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I had to quick get it,
get it treated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I knew what it was immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I, when I saw the skin reaction,
I knew what it was immediately is like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you got zero tall on you and I bet it came
from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was just, that's where it is part
of being the boss.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what's going on in the building,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So keep your drinks and your chemicals and
shit separate and have a plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get cost of chemicals in your
fucking fingers.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you got more than one person working
there, like in your home growth,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's probably just you, but in a
commercial facility, or if you got a homie
[SPEAKER_02]: backing you up label shit so that like,
they know that there is zero tall in this
[SPEAKER_02]: cup because we're cleaning these emitters,
like make, make that shit known like Mark
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to keep a big dry erase board and
every cultivation, every room has a
[SPEAKER_02]: dedicated dry erase board.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can mark down what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: When Mike does something like this room
needs to be defoliated by the end of the
[SPEAKER_02]: day, Michael do it, mark his initials.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I don't like the way it's
defoliated, I know to go cuss Mike out for
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's when you were talking about that on
the episode, I was thinking how nice it is
[SPEAKER_00]: that, that we can do that in legal land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that used to be like the one of the
top five tips for being a grower during
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition times, was don't keep,
like if you keep records, make it in code,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't make it obvious because your notes
are evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, now it's, there's a lot less of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can just have a big white board,
have SOPs, have logs, all that shit makes
[SPEAKER_00]: life so much easier and a lot safer.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: SOPs are one of my, at first I was afraid
of or intimidated or whatever turned off
[SPEAKER_02]: by SOPs and now I love a good SOP.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's kind of something in me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you want to pay me to write you
SOPs, like, oh yeah, that's like one of my
[SPEAKER_02]: favorite things to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me come look at your building.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what you got, we'll write fucking
from walking in and washing our hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll write an SOP from using the time
clock all the way to clocking out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get you fucking programmed with SOPs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, it cracks me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had more than one outfit that paid me
to help tweak theirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then six months later I come back to
do a follow-up and they're not following
[SPEAKER_00]: any of it and they can't figure out why
shit's not better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, well, have you tried
following the steps?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's all new employees that weren't
there before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you show that new staff,
the actual SOPs, you pull them out,
[SPEAKER_02]: you pull up the file and you go,
have you ever read this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they go, oh, that's such a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you come back in like three days and
like, yeah, the trimmers are faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fucking weight room is faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: The quality control is faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything seems to be smoother here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, we wrote SOPs step by step.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it looks like the lead grower is
just losing his mind, standing there,
[SPEAKER_02]: staring at the plants and looking off into
space.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've got SOPs and shit in our brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like, Oh man, we're going to have to
fucking do these next seven fucking steps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we already know like we got the map
in our head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes we just get that weird,
weird fucking look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, I don't envy that part of the part
of the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like my end.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't care for your end of the grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to talk about metric before we
even tell them what it is?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me in three words, explain to me how
you feel about metric.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll tell them what it is after
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck that spinning wheel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was more than too many words,
but that's going to be the general
[SPEAKER_02]: consensus for anybody who has to deal with
metric.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck that spinning wheel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Metric is the marijuana enforcement
tracking, blah, blah, blah system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The software system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be like, I get why it exists,
but it, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want them to come after me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't work in the MED anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't work with metric.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I work in the MED, but I don't
work with metric.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work in the backend.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't really have to talk to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hand you a clipboard and you do all that
metric shit for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Med fucking program.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucks and needs some fucking updates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the biggest waste of time in
people's days.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good program when it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea, the goal, the fucking purpose is
fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Execution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thumbs down zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck that fucking service, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike said, fuck that spinning wheel.
[SPEAKER_00]: When everybody's first question,
when they get into metric, is it supposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to randomly eat a 30 or day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, apparently that's not a bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a feature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any time we cut a clone, not transplant,
but move a plant from another room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything that really happens with plant
relocation, recreation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cut the clone to the time you,
you harvest it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's getting moved around in metric.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets into a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it's harvested, it gets weighed out
and reentered into metric.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's in metric.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all the waste gets put into metric.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the packages get put into metric.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you cut a clone that goes into metric,
the clone gets a number.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant it comes from has a mother plant
number, which is also included in that
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking clone number.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got clone number seven,
five, five, five, five that came from
[SPEAKER_02]: plant number seven, five, four,
four, four.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can follow all the way down the line
where each clone of each clone of each
[SPEAKER_02]: clone came from, which is cool because
then we can tell you once it's harvested,
[SPEAKER_02]: they go into batches and we can tell you
what pesticides were applied for fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: seven generations of those plants,
hypothetically.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see why all this is exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we have a recall and it's like
the 12 stores that bought plants that were
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested between these dates at this
facility all have to get, and they can
[SPEAKER_00]: track it down to the pre-rolls on the
counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nice system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not at all smooth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, half the time when you go to use it
and just the fucking, you get this little
[SPEAKER_02]: wheel of death that just spins in the
middle of your fucking screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like the little thing from,
there used to be a trivial pursuit game
[SPEAKER_02]: and it looks like the fucking trivial
pursuit thing just spins.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the Windows fucking thing just spin,
or the Apple thing that just spins right
[SPEAKER_02]: in the middle of the fucking screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But usually with like Windows or Apple,
even Windows, I'm an Apple guy,
[SPEAKER_02]: fuck a Windows machine in my opinion,
but it works better than goddamn metric.
[SPEAKER_02]: That thing eventually does something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Metric just goes fuck you, fuck you,
fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, and just
[SPEAKER_02]: spins in circles in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like middle fingers just coming at
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the shittiest part is this wasn't my
end of the building, but I witnessed this
[SPEAKER_02]: plenty of times because delivery drivers
would come to pick up product from the
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to pick it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's dried, trimmed, cured,
ready to go product.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to leave there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike just doesn't throw it in the car and
take it.
[SPEAKER_02]: A courier comes and gets it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they take that to either a processing
facility or to a dispensary for retail
[SPEAKER_02]: sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: For that product to leave our commercial
cultivation facility, it's got to be in
[SPEAKER_02]: metric as a package.
[SPEAKER_02]: That package has to be on a manifest for a
transport or for a transfer.
[SPEAKER_02]: If metric freezes, you cannot make the
manifest for the transfer and the package
[SPEAKER_02]: has to sit there in our facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if that delivery driver drove from
Boulder to pick it up, to take it to a
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrate processing facility or an
edible facility in Boulder until metric
[SPEAKER_02]: works again, everybody just hurry up and
wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've had delivery drivers just kicking
it in the office.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, Hey, do you have a phone charger?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've been here for like, oh,
and I'm not leaving because I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't go anywhere else because none of
the other facilities can do anything
[SPEAKER_02]: because metrics frozen everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they just kick it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a, there's a Thai food restaurant
right over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an Indian food place that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that, bro, I'm just hanging
out and have a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Metric will ruin your whole fucking day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of times I'm lucky because when I
cut the clones that I talk about have to
[SPEAKER_02]: be put into metric, I do it on a clipboard
because I got dirty ass hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm dirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in a hurry and I don't want to go to
the computer and fucking take off my
[SPEAKER_02]: gloves and type in six clones of fucking
chem dog and go back and put on gloves and
[SPEAKER_02]: cut more and then wipe off again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I keep a fucking marker and a big piece
of paper and I scribble it and Mike has to
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking put it in the computer for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm pretty spoiled on that part to tell
you the goddamn truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a lot of growth facilities have that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome, buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I always put any grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work at, I get Mike a spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, Mike's my metric guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just get Mike in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We work together and I point and grunt,
you know, what needs to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just got some really cool lightning
outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope we don't lose internet connection,
but it's really beautiful lightning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring on the rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring it, bring it, bring it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Metric can be a fucking headache.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to anybody out there that has to
mess with metric.
[SPEAKER_02]: Metric is in several states.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a metric warrior, I feel for
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only kind of keyboard warrior I
got love for is a metric keyboard warrior.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be fucking brutal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for damn sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always hated that when a delivery
driver was early and it was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: all right, dude, now I got to roll the
dice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, is it going to fuck with me today or
is it going to play nice?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it was going to play nice if you
showed up on time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then people are going to say,
well, why don't you make the manifest at
[SPEAKER_02]: the start of the day or the night before
there's a time limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can only make a manifest within a
certain timeframe before the delivery
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, we need the delivery driver's
identification while he's on site.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need the vehicle license plate number.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need the driver's identification,
his driver's license and his medical or
[SPEAKER_02]: his Colorado marijuana enforcement
division badge number.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't know if Kyle, the delivery
driver is coming in the Subaru.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know if Tom is coming in the
fucking Mitsubishi.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know if fucking Kyle is driving a
different car this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So unless you can contact them and then by
lunchtime traffic from fucking Boulder to
[SPEAKER_02]: Pueblo, that's three hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kyle may bail out and fucking Tom,
maybe he ended up being our fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: delivery driver today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then we got to tear up the whole
fucking manifest, cancel the delivery and
[SPEAKER_02]: redo the whole fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why we don't do the manifest in
the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only redo three or four manifests
before you stop trying to prep them too
[SPEAKER_00]: early.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's brutal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You redo too many of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden somebody's got
questions about why you're redoing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried to explain to people that are
like, man, legalization is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to grow weed in my basement and
sell it to stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: That part of legalization disappears
quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for like six months in a new
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get that wild, wild west vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you're Michigan, it feels like they
hung onto that shit for a while,
[SPEAKER_02]: but Oklahoma tightened up quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: California definitely tried, is trying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cali's unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: They dragged their feet for like 18 years,
which is why they're having so much
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the newer emerging legalization
markets, they seem to launch with much
[SPEAKER_00]: more rules and regs in place originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then some of the early launches did like
when Colorado and Cali and Washington
[SPEAKER_00]: first went, it was just like weeds legal
now, dot, dot, dot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like here, like, uh, so when you figure
out the taxes, a cut goes to schools.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the whole rule.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can carry two ounces and you can have
99 plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much the rules that we know
of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you want to have a good ass time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 99 plant rule wasn't even really a
rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a pre-existing federal rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a federal amplifier where the feds
had a rule in place for, and it wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: even a written down rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a rule of thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they catch a guy with 99 plants,
the federal government doesn't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the federal government finds you with a
hundred plants, they consider you Al
[SPEAKER_00]: Capone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that became just the de facto in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people for a while were going
with 499 because that was another federal
[SPEAKER_00]: cutoff where you got one penalty for 499
and another penalty for 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were the days, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last days were fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: People just open a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we've rented some space and we put up
a sign and it says weed and he's coming to
[SPEAKER_02]: buy an eighth if you got a card.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got four different strains and four
different jars and we've got a jugalow
[SPEAKER_00]: with a nightstick at the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're calling it good.
[SPEAKER_02]: The owner's wife made some edibles that'll
probably fucking halfway kill you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, they're only six bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, those were the days, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Karen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love you, Karen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your edibles fucking ruined my life in the
best of ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fell down the stairs at that dispensary,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ate too many of those fudge sticks one
day and I fell down those fucking stairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So stoned and comfortable that I just like
rolled down and just stood up and walked
[SPEAKER_02]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was just like how it was meant to
be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I didn't fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just didn't use my feet to get down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awkwardly beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many, you had to be there to
believe it type stories at that place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just every day there was another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was, I can tell you a thousand
good ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was the fucking the budtender.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd step into the bud room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you walk in and meet a lovely lady
named Tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should check your ID, check your
paperwork, make sure you're legit.
[SPEAKER_02]: My buddy would stare you down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, what's up Tree?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope you're well.
[SPEAKER_02]: She'll never hear this, but I hope she's
good either way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mr. Tamler, hope you're well.
[SPEAKER_02]: As well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So fucking the security guard would stare
you down and make sure you're not fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: going to do anything crazy, but he looked
more fucking threatening than anybody
[SPEAKER_02]: else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then people would come back into the
bud room and I'd have a few jars and we'd
[SPEAKER_02]: have some offerings and some edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you couldn't decide if you wanted
the white rhino or the Northern lights,
[SPEAKER_02]: fuck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fucking pack you up a bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one do you want to try?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let you try them both.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, which one you want first hit
that white rhino, get a good taste,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then hit that Northern lights or
whatever the white widow, whatever else I
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking said.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I really think I like that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I get an eighth?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's an eighth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since you're going to come back,
I know you come back here a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a fucking grandma, some other
random shit, just cause you buy a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: shit here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want you to, yeah, that way,
you know, you tried three while you're
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try that while you're home.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you like that and you got a lot of
options and we got a lot of people set up
[SPEAKER_02]: on medical marijuana, you'd be able to
come back and just smoke a bowl back
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lady that owned the place or the
owner's wife, she loved to bake and they
[SPEAKER_02]: grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And her favorite thing was to make
edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Her second favorite thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's such good homemade.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were delicious too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was amazing process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like grandma made banana bread,
kind of fucking edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like not like store bought, like weird,
but like the fudge dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the fudge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am like 99% vegan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody cares.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am like mostly vegan, but if some of
that fudge showed up, I'd have to take a
[SPEAKER_02]: bite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that stuff was so freaking good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like mostly dairy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this lady, I said her favorite thing
was to make amazing edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Her second thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was to bring them to the dispensary and
tell Mike and I, you got to try them
[SPEAKER_02]: because we can't put them on the shelf
without trying them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was before lab testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lab testing used to be like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three people ate it and then an hour later
had a conversation about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one of us was asleep on the couch,
we'd probably sell that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I was working there and she
brought in the edibles, she's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: here's your one of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And five minutes later, she was like,
which one have you tried?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, it's 10 on five in the
morning on a Tuesday and I'm at my new
[SPEAKER_00]: job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So none.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like, well, you got to try one.
[SPEAKER_00]: An hour later, it's like, oh fuck,
I have to work now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a puddle on the floor right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seemed like fate always juggled the
fucking puddle on the floor ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was never me and you on the floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: As one of us, like quite often one of us
had to go sit in the car and fucking get
[SPEAKER_02]: an extra lunch break.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd find you out in the back patio.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd find it you on that back patio
upstairs smoking a cigarette with this
[SPEAKER_02]: look on your face.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, oh, he just got too high on his
break.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll be back in a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just got to leave Mike alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was always enough of us in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could just juggle it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we never, I managed a 40 lane bowling
center and it always seemed to be the same
[SPEAKER_02]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of us would be like, you got to hide
from the boss.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like the rest of us would just make
the shit work and his job would get done
[SPEAKER_02]: or her job would get done.
[SPEAKER_02]: It always seemed to work that way at the
dispensary for us as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But those edibles, bro, I miss that lady
and I miss her edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fudge was especially nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fudge and the banana bread.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember specifically there were
chocolate covered cherries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was just insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cookies, all any kind of macadamia nut,
chocolate chip oatmeal, raisin,
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking sugar cookies, holiday time,
whatever holiday snack was available.
[SPEAKER_02]: She made that medicated and they were,
this was before all of the crazy
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were growing, none of this exists
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's not even here anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she can't get in any trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were growing in multiple,
multiple locations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like their house, their bedrooms had
plants in every bedroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to move plants over to take a
piss, like get them out of the way so you
[SPEAKER_02]: can use the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a lot of material to make
edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were not fucking amateur edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was like, how much weed can butter
possibly hold?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't can of butter at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like buttered cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would get sober.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you were totally right, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be 10 in the morning and she'd be
offering you fucking banana bread,
[SPEAKER_02]: carrot cake, fudge, and a sugar cookie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, uh, I'm going to get
diabetes and be too high to work by
[SPEAKER_02]: lunchtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you tell her, all right, I had,
I had a piece of the banana bread.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'd be like, cool, which one are you
going to eat next?
[SPEAKER_00]: And five minutes later, she'd be like,
how did it taste?
[SPEAKER_02]: She was a happy lady, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that woman.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was so nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to say both of their names
because I said too much already,
[SPEAKER_02]: but without them, we wouldn't be where we
are, Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I always like to remember that and pay
some homage and tribute to those folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that was the catalyst.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: His court trial introduced me to being
comfortable in a courtroom and
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding that process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think he relied on you for a lot of
that sort of stuff as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when, when the city ended that,
like they did that, that anger that fueled
[SPEAKER_00]: me to do years of city council shit,
just years off that one injustice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what Mike is talking about is,
uh, we had the privilege.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I've talked about this before on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had the privilege of being a large part
of the very first dispensary within the
[SPEAKER_02]: city of Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I found some people who were trying to
open a dispensary, no offense to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were older.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're of another generation.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't have the hip edge that a
dispensary needed and they didn't have any
[SPEAKER_02]: balls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, they had little balls.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were trying to get it started.
[SPEAKER_02]: They tried to do it on a third floor
office space.
[SPEAKER_02]: I moved the dispensary to the fucking
ground floor and put a sign out front.
[SPEAKER_02]: And fucking, we turned that little idea
into a fucking flourishing business.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was crushing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one day, uh, some city officials
came in and they're like, no mass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they shut us down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave us a letter that it literally
said we're closing your business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're breaking the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're discussing passing into law.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to close and that's just,
how can you shut a business down for
[SPEAKER_00]: passing rules that don't exist yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's insanely fucked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they did not know we were breaking
rules that did not exist yet until we paid
[SPEAKER_02]: them $21,000 in the tax payment.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was our retail sales tax that we paid
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they asked, how'd you make so
much money in such a short time?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they came to figure out what kind of
business we had.
[SPEAKER_02]: After we'd been on the news talking about
our business, after we'd made a solid
[SPEAKER_02]: business plan with the letter of intent,
all of that was filed appropriately.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then one day they're like,
they made $21,000 in taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go close that shit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was back when there were what four or
five, six dispensaries in the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, there may have been more than that
because, uh, when I got to take weekends
[SPEAKER_02]: off eventually, I worked there for fucking
six days a week for like six months,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I finally got, right after they
opened, there was a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: explosion across the state, the Broadster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then one of my jobs, the owner would
give me a budget to go cruise to other
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensaries in Colorado Springs,
Denver, Boulder, Fort Collins,
[SPEAKER_02]: wherever I could go.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I was going somewhere that weekend,
he'd be like, well, make sure to hit
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's your budget.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he'd fucking throw me money,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'd be like, make sure and we'd come back
and we'd all, uh, there would be back then
[SPEAKER_02]: we could smoke in the dispensary and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a little employee area and we'd all
just gather around on Monday morning and
[SPEAKER_02]: see what Jeff brought from Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking this is what I got a kind love.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what I got at the ganja gourmet.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what came from the clinic.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what came from cam.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'd all just set it all on the table
and just puff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause the owner of that store body,
it wasn't really mine, but he gave me the
[SPEAKER_02]: money to go see what's available at all
these other places.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was really fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they would just let me just fucking
here's 300 bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get us like a few eights of good shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I would walk out of stores back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I would go into stores and I'd be
like, man, I really don't want anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I remember when regs first
started going down, we did it again to see
[SPEAKER_00]: how each outfit was implementing new rules
that had come down the pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was always curious when he'd run
into a shop that was like, no,
[SPEAKER_00]: we decided fuck the new memo.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to do any of that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd see two weeks later,
they're gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, what happened to them?
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are still a couple of shops.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one around here that you mentioned
to me that I'm not going to say their name
[SPEAKER_02]: on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of times you asked me to do
that, but I don't want to, I don't need to
[SPEAKER_02]: call businesses out and start rivalries
and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're older than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're past that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but there's one shop around here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go there occasionally to get green dot
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause when the other spots out or I've
bought all the flavors there, or maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: I've gotten my fucking limit for the day
and I got to hit another shop or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go to this place and get some green
dot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's affordable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's effective there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're nice, but I look around and I'm
like violation number one, a violation
[SPEAKER_02]: number two.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like at least a $10,000 fucking
ticket right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you just brought out, instead of
bringing out the jar, they bring out the
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking 10 pound bag of flour and just
weigh it with our hand and scoop out your
[SPEAKER_02]: ounce like this into a baggie on the
scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, that's the, I see just
seven violations, like just in that
[SPEAKER_02]: transaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're still there though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they're fucking, they thrive.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always a line outside that fucking
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of that shit blows my mind because
I've been in, I've been involved in both
[SPEAKER_02]: sides of the coin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had metric come down on us and the
MED come down like this little thing that
[SPEAKER_02]: you did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've also called them and been like,
yeah, I've got a major fucking problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, Hey, thank you for
calling.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll solve this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's hard to guess what.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been on both sides of that fucking
coin with metric.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a weird, but I catch it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I, when I walk into their obvious
stuff and it's like, how are you getting
[SPEAKER_00]: away with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or there's one of my favorites is there's
a rule that you can't have a window where
[SPEAKER_00]: product is visible from the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's, I've been to multiple shops
where there's a giant window in the bud
[SPEAKER_00]: room that looks out on the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for some reason it hasn't occurred to
any regulator or inspector.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one on the way to the grow that we
managed out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a shop on the left side of the
road on your way out there that there's
[SPEAKER_02]: always a pretty girl standing in the
fucking window.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the bud room.
[SPEAKER_02]: She just standing by the window to get
fresh air, but there's always one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty girls fucking standing there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, that's the bud room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been in that dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's going to weigh the weed right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: When a customer comes in and you can see
her in the window.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's fucking plain as day and that
place only hires pretty girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it was up to me, that wouldn't be a
rule, but it is one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I honestly have no idea how they
haven't gotten slapped for that yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially that place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause the MED doesn't like them.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many different places don't swap their
carbon filters though we were required to
[SPEAKER_00]: filter like everything that leaves the
building.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are so many grows that haven't
swapped their carbon filters since they
[SPEAKER_00]: built the grow originally four or five
years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: 15 minutes west of here smells like a
fucking skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's a couple of spots in town
that are just like, Oh man, those filters
[SPEAKER_00]: are old as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're even looked up anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're bypassing dank into the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was it part of a kombucha.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well that, that, that's why some of the
neighborhood complaints.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why granny goes, it smells like
skunks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're over here going, look how good
we stuck up this neighborhood,
[SPEAKER_02]: bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you fucking nailed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually gotten visits from the MED
before going, Hey, your gross smells too
[SPEAKER_02]: bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to need to add more
filtration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my answer is, how do you know it's us?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the MED lady goes, I've been here
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, Oh, that's kind of like
the fucking coolest compliment ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, you know, like fuck you too,
but thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, uh, that's so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've run into so many people in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, uh, I've had department ag people call
me and ask me like, is this something that
[SPEAKER_00]: really has somebody told me this and this
today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that legit?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, Oh, definitely not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, my favorite is when the department of
ag would come to inspect our grow and I
[SPEAKER_02]: would have to answer questions for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the one lady was calling her boss to
ask a question and I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: no, that's, this is the answer here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she was so blown away.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was like, how do you know that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And shout out to a lady named Theo Walker.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thea is a bad mama jamma.
[SPEAKER_02]: She trains a six hour fucking class at the
Colorado state university of Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, she's yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the Colorado state university,
uh, the other one for Collins as a fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: six hour class.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she is a really good teacher.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's knowledgeable.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a genius.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she fucking certified me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trained the trainer certified for the
department of ag.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, yeah, I know a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I knew more than the department of ag
rep that was inspecting our building.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not more, but I knew the regulations
better than she did, which was kind of,
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were the poster boy, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: She used to call us and check in and see
how we were doing and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys take care of the people,
uh, part of being a good, if you want to
[SPEAKER_02]: be a commercial grower, people are always
like, you know, you're like, what am I
[SPEAKER_02]: going to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I be a good grower?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can grow weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Solitary fucking weirdo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go take care of the plants, but
contractors and fucking department of ag
[SPEAKER_02]: and department of health and the fire
department, uh, they're all going to come
[SPEAKER_02]: knock on the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: The police be nice to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those guys can shut you down immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kill yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: The electrical inspector, the fire
department, the fire inspector.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those guys can shut you down for the
dumbest, dumbest fucking reasons.
Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: But learn how to talk to those guys too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be nice to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be punctual.
[SPEAKER_02]: Call them, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Step your game up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be punctual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make it inspector way.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, cause they, they'll charge you for the
inspection and fucking make you
[SPEAKER_02]: reschedule.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, if you're there sitting in the
dressing, you're not there till August.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next August.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Inspectors don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just make the shit right or don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't say what department he was in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was a guy that was retiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so none of the businesses got
inspected for like nine months because he
[SPEAKER_00]: was just like, fuck that part of my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just didn't do inspections until he
retired.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the dude who took over for him
was like, why do I have to inspect every
[SPEAKER_00]: business?
[SPEAKER_00]: None of them have been inspected in the
last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got lucky in a facility because there
was a hot water heater installed just kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of on a, it was as close.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know who did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, those guys were the redo crew
instead of the build it crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had to come back twice for
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we got lucky because that inspector
that didn't give a shit about his job.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one's like, you're going to have to go
inspect everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: He showed up and he's like, where's the
hot water heater?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I go, it's up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes, I'm not climbing the fucking
ladder.
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks fine sign.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, we signed this one too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you need to sign this paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes, what's this for?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I go, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: They told me to have you sign this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I signed both of them and I got them
to sign off for extra shit in the
[SPEAKER_02]: construction at the same time,
just because he didn't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just like sign here too,
sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, scribble, scribble.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just got two of our inspections
passed in that building that I'm not even
[SPEAKER_02]: involved in now, but that was pretty
smooth.
[SPEAKER_02]: That guy didn't give a shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did not give a shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't even press hard enough to
fucking sign the paper completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was just like, job done going home,
beer in truck.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had the other kind of inspection
where they're like, no, we want to weigh
[SPEAKER_00]: it too.
Yup.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to smell the water that comes out
of that pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull the bag out of that trash can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's check the bottom of the can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, how about, I know this show is off the
fucking rails.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I wanted for, I triggered Mike with
this shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my fault.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what we really was shopping for.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people that come to inspect the
scales.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody's got OCD, it's the people who
inspect fucking scales, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: They come in with, uh, it's like,
but it's in a case this big.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, and they pull out these little,
they put gloves on his little white gloves
[SPEAKER_02]: and they take out these little tweezers
and they pull the weights out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: weight case with tweezers and they fucking
dust your scale off and they blew air into
[SPEAKER_02]: it with the air sprayer and they
calibrated it like 14 times and certified
[SPEAKER_02]: our scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had to have taken a four fucking hours
to certify our scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the more scales you have,
the longer that dude's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't remember if it's once a year,
twice a year or once every other year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was too often because he takes so
fucking long.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, are we paying this guy hourly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like he's fucking the,
in the dispensaries, they have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: certified really frequently and it would
shut the bedroom parts of the bedroom down
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: All day.
[SPEAKER_02]: He takes the weights out of a little
container out of like, uh, it looks like
[SPEAKER_02]: when you got a drill bunch of drill bits,
uh, but the weights are in those little
[SPEAKER_02]: drill bit holders.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got like a socket set.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that's similar what I'm thinking,
but they're all wrapped in a little
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking fabric package too, because you
can't get any moisture on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, moisture and fucking, uh, if I,
if I sneeze at it, that'll make it way
[SPEAKER_02]: different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this is 0.1.
[SPEAKER_02]: And 0.1 is so light.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, and this is 0.2 and this 0.3 and
he cleans them off as he gets them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got this little rag and he fucking
cleans them off and then he puts them on
[SPEAKER_02]: the scale and he cleans it again and puts
it on the scale again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, bro, that scale is accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'd put my money on it, like fucking
move the fuck on dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it just, I don't know, there's
something, it was just making my blood
[SPEAKER_02]: boil watching him take fucking four hours
to calibrate six fucking scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watching them do the, the hanging scale
that we weighed, um, harvesting plants on
[SPEAKER_00]: like the scale unit itself looks like kind
of like a game boy with a metal hook
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging out of one end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's zip tied to a metal bar
that's on a rolling, like a, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you had a closet bar on a roll rack or
a doorway or rolled around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so the rack itself is framed out maybe
five feet tall, six foot long,
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole thing's coated in trichomes and
parts of plant leaves and a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wheels on it are all fucked up and
janky and coated with shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This poor kid's trying to get it to weigh
whatever on the, oh man, he was not
[SPEAKER_00]: amused.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not amused.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was taking so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were trying not to lose it on each
other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that scale sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fish scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of what that resembles like,
yeah, but the digital fish scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So good shit deal with a lot of weird shit
working in a commercial girl, Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're way off the rails today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, support white Mike on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it when they ramble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Patreon.com forward slash white Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Help a cracker out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, uh, patreon.com forward slash.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like hanging out with us from your
heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took a dab a couple of minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike pulled a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not regular for this show.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're just hanging out, having a good
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's episode five 60.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike was like, Hey, is it five 60?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, fuck yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, I have whatever you got.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got a list of shit here and we have
abandoned ship.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a good time today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some more serious episodes in
the works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, uh, had a couple of people ask me if
I do a, another legalization primer,
[SPEAKER_00]: how to get it going in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I told Jeff, that one's not ready yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to put a little more work into my
examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a couple more gross specific
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of good email questions coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not going to get a whole bunch
of these ramble episodes coming up,
[SPEAKER_00]: but every now and then we needed one of
these.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all, the whole collective needed this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The iry army had to grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soldiers all needed this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't need this, add NemoPunk15.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: YouTube will let you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, they want more light.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want you to turn up your mic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want you to quit being a whiny liberal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but like at your back, bro,
you keep being a like, ah, I hate to say
it.
No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of that's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of that's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I invite you onto the show for a reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: So be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be you buddy, don't change anything for
anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my, that's for all of you and I
just might be you be the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could fucking be in, if someone don't
like it, thank for you bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Mike, what's a really delicious food
name, something really delicious that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: not going to want to eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking good shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I could smell steak from Applebee's.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells good, but I see people lined up
all the time, not for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The steak at Applebee's is not good,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does smell good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are a lot of people out there
waiting for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just not for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some shit that's not for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If fucking you're delicious, bro,
just the way you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saying everybody out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're fucking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: You smell good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You taste just right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're creative.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're expressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a good person.
[SPEAKER_02]: If someone don't like you, that is not
your problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many people on this planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody's got a problem, would you go
play with one of the other 6.9 billion?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not even fucked that person at
this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, what about that person?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even have any negative to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even have a feeling at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm too busy for like, oh, fuck that guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I got a podcast record.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some plants to take care of.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a fucking 16 year old daughter,
a fucking 17 year old daughter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy birthday, kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two kids, a garden, a wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like life is busy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram live show to try to manage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I got to take some dabs somewhere
in the middle of all that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on like nine podcasts right now,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good time to do a shameless plug.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am on the grow from your heart podcast
every Monday and Thursday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course I do my Monday live show on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not already checking that out
every Monday, that is a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That has been booming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been hitting record numbers for
myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every Monday on Instagram, I go on
Instagram live.
[SPEAKER_02]: All you have to do is follow me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see if you go to my profile,
if there's a red circle around my icon,
that means I'm live.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll get a notification on your screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll say, I read genetics is live.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For some reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: I may be, I may have a little shadow band
going.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ruffled some feathers and somebody
probably fucking ruffler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, it's this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: They probably got me a little shadow band
going, but whatever it'll come out of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but make sure you follow me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just look for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All you have to do, you'll see if you go
to my profile, if there's a red circle
[SPEAKER_02]: around my icon, that means I'm live.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, or I posted something to my story,
but the red circle, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it says live in purple over it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I'm live, it'll let you know,
come check me out on Instagram live every
[SPEAKER_02]: Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got that podcast Mondays and
Thursdays, Instagram live Mondays at seven
[SPEAKER_02]: mountain time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then frequently, there's not really a
schedule, no rhyme or reason to my
[SPEAKER_02]: schedule on embracing organics on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every Thursday night at 7 PM on YouTube,
I'm on a podcast called embracing
[SPEAKER_02]: organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not every, they're there every Thursday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't join them every week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a regular member of the panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I jump in when I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I've got the seed company,
my own podcast, my daughter, plenty of
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs to stroke, seed packaging,
organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm there three out of four weeks out of
the month.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to the whole EO crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stabby, Dan, f****** Tenasi, Fumidor,
Zan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to look at the screen and think
of the whole Brady bunch that would be on
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to miss somebody, but I love all
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dave, the whole crew, my own adopted kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then on Saturdays, most Saturdays at
summertime, I've been taking some
[SPEAKER_02]: Saturdays off, but a lot of Saturdays at 2
PM mountain time, I do the, what's it
[SPEAKER_02]: called?
[SPEAKER_02]: The Operation Grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we do is a whole bunch of people got
the same pack of seeds, the same
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients, the same soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've all got auto pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're using orangegasm seeds from
iReGenetics in auto pots and playground
[SPEAKER_02]: soil with new millennium nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only difference in most of the grows,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only difference in most of the grows
is the lighting and the environment,
[SPEAKER_02]: the tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and everybody's got a PL Grow minder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can see what everybody's doing in
their room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm going to just clear my throat
real hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody's got the same gear
basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we all meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all got a minor unit going too,
huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can look at their minor units and see
what's going on and compare that to their
[SPEAKER_02]: pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sexy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see a lot of cool shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: My email keeps opening on my screen
repeatedly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was really weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fixed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so that's every Saturday at 2 PM
mountain time, Operation Grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be called Operation Grow 2019.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because we started in 19,
but rest assured it is current.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to watch any of those shows
live.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all available on video.
[SPEAKER_02]: I leave the Instagram video up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I am going to do my best to make
more content.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hinted in a previous episode that I had
something to handle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it got handled today, but I'm
confident that I've freed up some more
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we'll be able to put out more
content.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty soon here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to make promises.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want this big mouth to write Jax's
little skinny ass can't cash, but I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty good at fucking coming in on my
word.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm trying to do more content on my own
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I do things on Cannibuzz as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: When Cannibuzz does breeder panels and
stuff like that, I joined Cannibuzz and I
[SPEAKER_02]: go on their breeder panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did a 420 show and they did some
other stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a good time, but yeah, I do stuff
on Cannibuzz too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So check me out on Cannibuzz if you're not
already on Cannibuzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do a lot of fucking podcasting,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other stuff on our plate too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a breeding project going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've both got families.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've both got personal lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a fucking playground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life is interesting right now,
even though we're all stuck at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of fun shit going on
digitally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've developed a new addiction to shoe
shopping, not just any shoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a couple of very specific shoes that
I've fallen in love with.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you follow me on social media,
you know what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But man, I'm getting up early because
there are shoe drops and shit at certain
[SPEAKER_02]: stores and on certain websites.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can only get this one pair.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like today, a pair of shoes came out at
like two o'clock this afternoon and nobody
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking said anything about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just Nike sent out a message was like,
there's new shoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, wait, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went and I was like, those are
fresh, buy them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I went to show them to somebody
else when they got off work like an hour
[SPEAKER_02]: later, I was like, Hey, look at these cool
shoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, I can't find these on the
internet anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they came and went, dude,
fucking that quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a pair of them luckily.
[SPEAKER_02]: But man, that's been one of my new,
uh, my passions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't play video games.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's my new video game.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking trying to chase down those
shoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some adrenaline that comes with
it, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've known more than one sneaker head my
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, y'all like hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Y'all like the rare rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like a certain kind and a certain color.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I find them, I'm like,
I'm going to find this shoe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I find them and they're like a
couple of hundred more dollars than I want
[SPEAKER_02]: to pay for them or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, that's out of my fucking
price range.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then that puts me on a mission,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That puts me on like maybe a month or so,
but I'll find them at the price.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to pay for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll find them, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's been my COVID fucking time
pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID does different shit to different
people, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know more than one person that
online shopping is, is gotten them hooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a, a couple of family members
that have found some Facebook group where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a page where these two women are
running like a little, they find
[SPEAKER_00]: something, they do a package for like a
hundred bucks and then they sell 15,
[SPEAKER_00]: $10 tickets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's like 50 going into the bank and
then somebody for a $15 ticket or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, a $10 ticket gets a hundred
dollars worth of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so everybody goes home happy or
everybody ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're so hooked on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another family member that is
just like doing home repair projects like
[SPEAKER_00]: mad, but with the time this ends,
their house is going to be worth
[SPEAKER_00]: substantially more than it was when they,
the plague started.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, you know, another old guy that's
done the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he's built a shed and a fence and a
fucking, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just lives at Lowe's now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost said his name because it's
similar to Lowe's.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, he lives it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, cross those fucking names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want their name on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure he doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't want the world to know he
exists.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, all those people at Lowe's bro,
I'm not even going there.
Nevermind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I have to hit a hardware store,
it's the busiest place in town.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jumping still.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm looking forward to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Movie theaters opening on Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ain't going to see a movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a hunter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get some fucking popcorn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been missing that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Movie theater popcorn, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been jonesing for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's special.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you not make that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that like a thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a foodie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think whatever they do with the theater,
whatever oil they're using, whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: machine they're using, it just,
it tastes different than what you make in
[SPEAKER_00]: the microwave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not like crazy different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both still popcorn, but that
texture is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got, I don't know if they put a
little heroin in there or some shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's so much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sprinkled a little crack on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pour a little crack on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a Thai food restaurant in Colorado
Springs that there's nothing like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've eaten at a million Thai food
places and I'm like, can we just go there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are we wasting our time?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the one, like I found it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In college, I would not routinely,
cause I couldn't afford it routinely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I wanted Chinese food,
I would save up so that I could go get my
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred dollar order from the place that
was an hour and a half away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a three hour round trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd go get enough to last you all
goddamn week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just incomparable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other place is a cheap knockoff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to make some people time travel
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the day, 99, 2000, 2001,
maybe 2002, 2003, that era, the jam band
[SPEAKER_02]: scene was cranking it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the string cheese incident and all
that level of bands.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a theater in Boulder called the
Fox theater.
[SPEAKER_02]: My buddy Robbie and I would drive to the
Fox theater and park in the same little
[SPEAKER_02]: parking area every weekend and catch the
show with the Fox.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was always a hippie jam band.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen a hundred shows at the Fox
theater, but it was a ritual that we would
[SPEAKER_02]: go to the smelly deli across the street
and get up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was always into the falafel and hummus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would get two of those bad, maybe get
three of those bad motherfuckers just
[SPEAKER_02]: because like you're saying that Chinese
food restaurant, it's an hour and a half
[SPEAKER_02]: away, but it is the best thing ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had other friends that we would end up
going there and they'd get one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be like, bro, you're going to want to
get two because halfway home, you're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be dreaming about the fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I've got other friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if I took Gibbs with me, he would
just, I need three of whatever he would
[SPEAKER_02]: order.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I need three of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'd eat one now, one later in the car and
one for tomorrow just because it's three
[SPEAKER_02]: hours away, but oh my God, it's so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to the smelly deli.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sold to somebody else and Tim and Baba
moved on and now it's not what it used to
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very different now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still good, but not what it used to
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he said Boulder, I was like,
yeah, it's the Fox, the bird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Baba, two beef kiddos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking Baba at each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: They both called each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Baba, Baba, two falafel hummus,
Baba, no hot sauce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's fucking all you heard in that
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Miss it, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Miss it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to the smelly deli on the hill
in Boulder.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the place, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, what else you got for us,
man?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been going for a long fucking time.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a really good podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was just thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you said we're trying to do more
content, I was like, fuck, we could split
[SPEAKER_00]: this show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of, uh, there's no grown knowledge
or there's some nuggets hidden in here,
[SPEAKER_02]: but instead of giving them fucking two
Ramble box shows, we'll just get one
[SPEAKER_02]: really long Ramble cast.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some couple of really good
nugget we could drop for people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: still listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I know you people are still listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: You love to come up with something good,
bro, cause you're on the spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, man, I'm on patreon.com forward slash
grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blazed and tired.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at my eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: My eyes usually aren't this red on this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're nice and toasty red.
[SPEAKER_02]: That dab of the honey banana and bananas
foster really put a fucking twist on my
[SPEAKER_02]: day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, uh, if you've got ideas for what
should be behind me, feel free to hit me
[SPEAKER_00]: up on social media, whichever one you want
to attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want my Twitter email the show or put
it up on Facebook, put it up on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: What should be behind me?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just need to get you just a plain
colored background, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark, plain black background.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, uh, you sent me the link for would be
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just need to get it ordered and,
uh, get it attached to my ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's patreon.com forward slash white
Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll order that background.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if he doesn't do it soon, I'll buy it
for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it looks good on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add a couple of lights down here,
make it a little less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to blur out my kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got space behind me and I'm just
blurring out his stuff with darkness,
[SPEAKER_02]: bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're okay with the kids' toys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, somebody told me and I won't shout
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll shout them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout it to the person said looks
militant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I got a flag behind me and I'm
coming up all wrong stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there are shitty you're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are plans in the future to,
uh, change some background stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know, time's coming, time's
coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got all self-conscious looking at
backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, Oh, I like that one,
but I don't know if I can put that behind
[SPEAKER_00]: me or Ooh, there's a good three 11 one,
but I don't know if the band wants my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinions on top of their logo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do the band one dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get you a plain color one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get you that plain color thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flat black, flat gray, one light green in
a corner coming at you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll look good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make you look like Fumidor.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Fumidor Chibidor and the
Portland cannabis tasting society.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I got that right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even if that's not the right group,
so that's a cool group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, dabs are fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dabs are amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dabs have gotten us a long way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's how we started a lot of
this Ramblecast was talking about,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, how this COVID is, uh, dabs have
gotten us through COVID.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we looped it all the way back around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, you're a good storyteller.
[SPEAKER_00]: My little project listeners that are still
with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna, I've got to clean up and reset
up my tabletop Buddha vape to go with a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice hockey puck of some bubble hash I was
getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gifted old school bubble bag bubble hash
pressed into a puck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's 94.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reminds me of a guy that used to pop up in
that old dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: He brought me a big old puck of bubble
hash one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: These, uh, was out of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran into a, an old friend of mine and it
was like, Hey, I ran into a guy that makes
[SPEAKER_00]: these.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want one?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got like six with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was like, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, sure to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got this beautiful puck of hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I going to do with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just moved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's that vape again?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to use place and get that
wand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily I had spare parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get my vape out and get it cleaned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it set back up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully it still works.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was your intention just to put the
bubble hash, kind of break it off of the
[SPEAKER_02]: chunk, break it up into kind of smaller
pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's got more surface area and then
just put it directly into the wand part of
[SPEAKER_02]: the vape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the vape loads up a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a pipe would screen in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You throw some, I usually break off like
two green peas worth of hash and throw
[SPEAKER_00]: those size chunks in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a couple of draws with it hooked up to
the heating elements so that the hash
[SPEAKER_00]: softens and then get in there with a dab
tool or a paper clip and give it a stir
[SPEAKER_00]: and really open up that surface area in
your next three or four poles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it hit the face of the shovel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have to get you some
solventless to try like that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the bubble hash is solventless,
but I mean some, like some SHO,
[SPEAKER_02]: some salt solventless honey oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard with COVID and the fucking
plague going on, but I'd like to hit a
[SPEAKER_00]: handful of shops and really do just kind
of a tour of Southern Colorado and see
[SPEAKER_00]: what people have for concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a while there were a bunch of
different companies doing bubble or key
[SPEAKER_00]: for dry sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had a number of different
products on the market, but for the last
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of years, I mean, I haven't been
looking, but it seems to me, like most of
[SPEAKER_00]: the shops have moved to solvent extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Timons and sauce.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of solventless products.
So we've got a few of those things that
sell well.
[SPEAKER_02]: that's out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's in big demand, but it's expensive
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like its own special niche.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talk about talk about auto flowers being
like the seed hoarders and collectors are
[SPEAKER_02]: a special group of nerds, but then auto
flowers and then like land race.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are your special niches.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like, there's concentrate smokers.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's fucking connoisseurs, but then
there's the fucking heady, heady boys that
[SPEAKER_02]: are smoking the fucking solvent lists and
just like 90 a gram and shit.
It's like, it's like, it's like,
it's like, it's like, it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like, it's like, it's out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a friend on Facebook or a real world
friend post up, you know, Hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in Arizona now.
[SPEAKER_00]: How the fuck y'all get ice cream home
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just started laughing and I was
like, Oh girl, if you can't figure out how
[SPEAKER_00]: to get ice cream home, like we're trying
to move 15, 80, 90 gram hash home in a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred degree heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't be having that shit melt in the
car.
[SPEAKER_02]: These people show up to the fucking
dispensary with a cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last two times I've gone to a
dispensary man, ice packs in the cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only way to fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I'm not going to drop 200 on hash and
get home and have it all glued into a
[SPEAKER_00]: corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not again.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why people, sometimes when I show
up, people ask me if I'm Grubhub because I
[SPEAKER_02]: carry a white cooler with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got the white cooler with me because
I've got a couple of water bottles in
[SPEAKER_02]: there that are frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they're keeping everything cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a can of butane in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: My rig is in the cooler because now when
it's hot outside, like it was a hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: and fucking four degrees today,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine if you left the rig in the car,
the rig is going to be hot as shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you put it to your mouth,
the glass is going to, ow, 110 degree
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The water is going to be sizzling when you
go to steam in your lungs and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's miserable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now my rig was in the fucking cooler.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like hitting chilled water.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so nice when you hit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my concentrates are all nice and
fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in a cooler.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I've got a cooler.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not Grubhub.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Dabhub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dispensary is only 15 minutes away
from my house, but it's a hundred and four
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees the half hour I'm in the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter how cool my car was on
the way over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking hotter and shit when I come
out, but I pop open that cooler,
[SPEAKER_00]: toss my hash inside, grab an ice cold
drink, roll home and comfort.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Life is good, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID is weird, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the first time I left the house in
like 15 days was to go to the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were like 10 people waiting in
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was crowded.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to stop going to one dispensary for
a couple of days because they're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, um, you're back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, Nope, fucking bored.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't interact with other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why not pick up two more grams while
I'm here?
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to see if my voice works.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't fucking used it in a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to see if anybody else could hear
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk to someone that wasn't my
kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All I did was hand you my ID and say two
of these, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is fucking exciting.
Yeah.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go fucking grocery shopping for like,
uh, one item.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know what I need,
but I'll go find one.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about this bottle of kombucha?
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks good.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been here in the store for 30
minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should fucking get out of here now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just walked around and looked at nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever I have to leave, I end up
dawdling now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if I run out for, I need one thing,
I'll spend 40 minutes walking around that
[SPEAKER_00]: store being like, am I sure I don't need a
second thing?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to the mall for a pair of shoes the
other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I looked at every store in that mall.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were no people there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just like, well, we've got them
all to ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just cruised and fucking shopped.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when we walked into the mall,
the people in the stores, the people like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so good to see you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I help you with anything?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you like to try something?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, can I get something off the top
shelf, something off the bottom shelf?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you like that in a different color?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like maybe we got it in the back for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: What were you looking for?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your name?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know if any other people may come
here today?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, because I feel like I'm a hostage
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they're just fucking.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ball was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went and tried to, I had to go get a
propane tank refilled and I ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: getting propane accessories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not get propane accessories,
but I did come home with almost $200 in
[SPEAKER_00]: t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them better have Hank Hill on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no Hank Hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the store that's got the propane
refill also has the best shirts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you make it sound like we live next to
like a, like the fucking hickest gas
[SPEAKER_02]: station in town.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do get propane and shirts at Walmart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big R.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, that was my next guest, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my next guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carhartt shirts and propane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yo, our lives are different, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are our lives are different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an off the rails fucking show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been trying to keep it that way too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen opportunities, 200 episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen good opportunities to talk about
cannabis and I've just flat out refused.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, Nope, we're going to go route
B for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just been fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a long show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been going for probably an hour and
25 minutes, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you do get tired, they need a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should probably mention that the last
two times I bought flour in town,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was trimmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people are listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took that advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for trimming your shit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do prefer trimmed weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now next step, now that we're trimming it,
get rid of the goddamn Boveda packs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm torn on the Boveda packs in the
dispensary because that damn jar is open
[SPEAKER_02]: and closed so many times that I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of, I've gotten, do you want the
crunch or do you want the Boveda pack?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like your options right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, I know it's like fucking shit
sandwich or a fucking punch to the balls,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you take your pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, uh, it is a toss up and it is
difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't envy the people that have to
fight with the humidity levels in the,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the jars, the product, but,
um, the system where they open the jar in
[SPEAKER_00]: the morning and select a display nug and
that's the way it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like people are smelling shit
now.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the, the shops I've been going to
lately, they've just moved a glass display
[SPEAKER_00]: case and they get the jar close to you so
that you can see it good, but you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause now you're looking at it through a
layer of glass and it's still in the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you don't know what it smells like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get it home and you open it up and
take a whiff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, um, that little, that little
display jar that people could smell it,
[SPEAKER_00]: look at, um, before the plague hit was,
uh, was my favorite method.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the end of the day,
you take that one nug that has gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: dried out from getting sniffed by 80
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You throw that back in the larger jar to
rehydrate and even up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it keeps the whole jar from getting
aired out 15, 20 times a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other solution is prepackaged dates
and people fucking hate prepacks.
[SPEAKER_02]: They think for some reason they're going
to rip me off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, bro, it's a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not the fucking, we're not some
shady dealer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're right here on this address every
day, the signs out front.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you think it doesn't away,
come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the last two pre-packs I bought
weren't bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two before that were crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I knew what I was getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's when you can always, always tell when
it's half the price it's supposed to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and if it's in a store, that reason's
probably not cause it's stolen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably cause it's shitty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's in an alley could go either
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my favorite shops in Denver,
it doesn't exist anymore, but they've one
[SPEAKER_02]: of the, some of the regulations they gave
up, but they were one of the first that I
[SPEAKER_02]: appreciated their prepack because they
were slamming busy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't need, I don't need the reason
we used to weigh our weed in front of each
[SPEAKER_02]: other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is cause I don't trust you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you want to see that it says 3.5 on
the scale and you want to know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to count your money.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to watch the scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how business works.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have, they do weigh your meat that
you go to the butcher, but you don't get
[SPEAKER_02]: your cereal weighed in front of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get everything weighed out in
front of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes in cans and boxes and you trust
that it says eight ounces fucking on the
[SPEAKER_02]: package.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think cannabis is we're there with the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, it's so much quicker.
[SPEAKER_02]: There'd be a line out the door at this
place cause they were the slamminest
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensary and it was a little tiny shit
check.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they would just spend all night pre
weigh in shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that tomorrow the shop can flow instead
of fucking two budtenders center going 3.5
[SPEAKER_02]: again, 3.5 again.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you want?
[SPEAKER_02]: Any of this, any of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: 3.5, seal it up, put a sticker on it,
put the jar away, get the other jar out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah, they sat there all night or there's
somebody in the back right now just
[SPEAKER_02]: weighing out this whole pound will be
eights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want eights, we got them.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want a quarter, you get two eights.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want an ounce, you get eight
eights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they just bet they're busting them
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's way bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's way more efficient and the
product stays fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vastly more efficient, but they didn't
weigh out my concentrates in front of me
[SPEAKER_00]: and I trust them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck out of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, uh, it's not that it's knocking away
when it's, um, the last two I bought,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were in a clear packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked, I mean, it was a different
shape, but it was essentially the
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging you get a cheap toothbrush in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there was a backing to it and then it
had a clear plastic bubble that was full
[SPEAKER_00]: of herb and it was Colorado packaging
compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a bitch to open and yada,
yada, yada.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you could see into the pack and tell
that it was quality looking herb that was
[SPEAKER_00]: well trimmed and not all stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the, the two that I pre-packs that I
bought before that that were bad,
[SPEAKER_00]: both of them were like little pebble nugs,
little gravel sized nugs and had fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: fan leaf in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not sugar leaf, not, wasn't trimmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actual chunks of family and in the
pre-packaged tens, chunks of family and
[SPEAKER_00]: then huge sticks for no reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's a little popcorn,
no gum, the end and then a long stick for
[SPEAKER_00]: no reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, why is this in my, in my
container?
[SPEAKER_00]: A packager did this on purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be fired.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just not accept the first time
you end up with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so hard to buy a pre-pack after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, my experience with pre-rolls three,
four years ago or why I haven't had a
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-roll in three or four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, it's just, I can't trust it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like when people go to the
dispensary and buy the cheapest product in
[SPEAKER_02]: the store and then leave a bad review
based on the cheapest product they could
[SPEAKER_02]: have bought.
[SPEAKER_02]: That drives me crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought a pre-roll and it tastes
terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of the $2 pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, bro, what did you expect?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't put the gold on the fucking
bottom shelf for two bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to buy at least a middle shelf
product to leave a quality review.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only time I really, really supported
that complaint was when a shop was doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're a veteran, you get a pre-roll
for, I can't remember if it was a penny,
[SPEAKER_00]: a dime or a quarter or a dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was a quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it was stupid cheap for a pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was seven or eight or $9 cheaper than
anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you had to be a vet to go get the
deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had more than one vet telling me
that they heard about the deal,
[SPEAKER_00]: were excited about it, went in and tried
it and ended up getting like trim material
[SPEAKER_00]: rolled into a cone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were really pissed that they were
getting sold leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and told it was a standard quality
pre-roll from that place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I thought, I thought at that point,
they really had a decent complaint,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was just a regular person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you ask me for the cheapest shit
on the shelf, don't be surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not also the best quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheapest shit on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you just reminded me of a random,
I'll go ahead and I'm going to write down
[SPEAKER_02]: my topic, but you keep going and I'll take
a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a shop, uh, this spring that,
uh, they had their normal jars on the
[SPEAKER_00]: shelf and a couple of managers,
special sales or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the shelves, there was a jar
that was marked special with a sign that
[SPEAKER_00]: said last year's outdoor seated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was 50 an ounce instead of,
I think their next cheapest out the door
[SPEAKER_00]: ounce was 89, 99 or 99 bucks or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it was substantially cheaper per
gram or whatever per ounce, but you knew
[SPEAKER_00]: what you were getting going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like you'd get it home and
discover that it was, that's why it was
[SPEAKER_00]: cheaper.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's legit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you tell me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw that and I was like, why is that
hard?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why can't other people just be upfront
like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so easy to just throw that up on the
side and let people know.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you not watching on YouTube,
Jeff's taking a nice size dab here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really pretty butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice big dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice big vapor cloud.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to be quiet for a minute while
that goes to his brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just keep a rambling.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need a rescue, I totally have a
good ramble.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just gave me two good topics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we had a jar show up at a dispensary
and we didn't know what it's called.
[SPEAKER_02]: Random weed in the baggie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, somebody forgot to label it,
you know, stoned owners.
[SPEAKER_02]: I labeled it stinky Peter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that sounds like somebody's name right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like a guy named stinky Peter
until the first customer, everyone's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: why'd you call it stinky Peter?
[SPEAKER_02]: The first customer came in and said,
can I smell your steam?
[SPEAKER_02]: They stopped themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody heard it and they fucking
thought it was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I smell your stinky Peter was said so
many, can I check out your stinky Peter?
[SPEAKER_02]: That phrase happened so many times
throughout the day and it was well worth
[SPEAKER_02]: putting that fucking label on the jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stinky Peter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it was a discount jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: We gave stinky Peter out for super cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I have a really reliable source in the
cannabis packaging industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to one of the best cannabis
packagers in the fucking world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking weed game.
[SPEAKER_02]: She doesn't need her name said,
she knows who she is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm proud of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's kicking ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, she may have told me that there is a
national cone shortage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Raw cannot provide cones because of the
company, the factory that makes them is
[SPEAKER_02]: shut down due to Corona.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the pre-rolls and cones are out for
them at their grow at their facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't order anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And pretty soon that will ripple out to
other States and areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: My lighting just went weird in the camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was strange.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but yeah, pre-rolls are fucking,
they can't get any cones, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ripples from COVID are going to keep
bouncing coast to coast for honestly,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd put my money on Christmas next year is
the earliest we're going to really head
[SPEAKER_00]: back to normal to what it was like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in the middle of 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but every day it seems like I hear
about a new one where somebody's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: can't get watermelons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, cause the trucks that ship them
don't have tires cause the tire factory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I was wondering when it was going to
really start fucking with the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, immediately I kind of smiled because
like I really doubted out there doing that
[SPEAKER_00]: gorilla inspections now where they go hit
55 shops in a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not happening right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are grows having any industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are shortages of soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't get soil deliveries right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, soil is short.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nutrients are short.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of shit is short.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the plastic stuff is in demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, I mean on the commercial scale,
how many different trucks show up every
[SPEAKER_00]: week?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's daunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's a truck guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a nutrients guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a pots guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a piping guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some places have a water guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's a CO2 guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: CO2 guy that falls asleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so many different deliveries.
[SPEAKER_00]: If any part of that chain hitches,
like your CO2 guy can't come for a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to fuck up your harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your harvest is, your harvest is 30%
smaller than it was last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to fuck with your store
supply.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't get soil delivered or cocoa
delivered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking cones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, the cones are really going to fuck
with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's whole dispensary outfits whose
sole business is based on cones existing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a couple of people who their jobs
are to roll cones all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just read an article, some dispensary
somewhere not in Colorado was in another
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had to, uh, destroy thousands of
free rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's totally fake.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chick was licking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's totally fake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guarantee you, guarantee you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's another one where they have to
toss.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was $2.6 million at cartridges and the
company's destroying it cause they won't
[SPEAKER_00]: move and they're trash now because the
market base has no confidence that the
[SPEAKER_00]: state can, um, test for, I think in that
state, the big fear is led.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but coming off all of the vaping free
from last year, it was clearly a cutting
[SPEAKER_00]: agent in the cartridges.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, what happened to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some cartridges just sit the, we got
murder hornets, tiger King, murder
[SPEAKER_02]: hornets, COVID.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we forgot all about the fucking vape
carts killing people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what happened predominantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the little kids are in Wayfair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the black market vape business
just, they got hit hard and the,
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone still surviving in that marketplace
has drastically re uh, restructured their
[SPEAKER_00]: business model.
[SPEAKER_02]: They might have had to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a friend that would buy,
allegedly I knew a guy who's twin
[SPEAKER_02]: brother's cousin would buy packaging that
looks just like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can order that packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Packaging on a website.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't say the name of the website.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can buy that exact packaging and you
can buy those carts and they're empty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And allegedly I knew a guy that in another
state, his hustle was to buy carts that
[SPEAKER_02]: look like that and fill them up with his
homemade oil and sell them as that brand's
[SPEAKER_02]: carts for a fucking premium price and an
illegal state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all this scare of fucking carts
came out and his business went to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't surprise me at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you can be sure that you're buying
a regulated safe, inspected, tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it fucks me up, there's a method for me
to be like, why did you do that Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can track it back to whoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can see which plant it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see which facility it was made
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be shocked if that's still a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's clearly where all the nasty
carts were coming from.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got some numbers on the back here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know which one is which,
but I could see the, uh, the grow
[SPEAKER_02]: facility, the processing facility and a
couple other numbers on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if something went wrong with this,
I would know who to contact.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be a pretty easy process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The distributor number, the processing lab
number and the grow number and batch
[SPEAKER_00]: number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all right there on the back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'd call the dispensary or go there
and say, Hey, this is moldy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'd fucking call the producer or
just roll down the chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd probably just give you a free one,
but you know, it feels worse than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One for a penny because you can't do free
in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Mike, I'm stoned and fucking running
out of energy, buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting tired.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to start wrapping up this fucking
ramble fest?
