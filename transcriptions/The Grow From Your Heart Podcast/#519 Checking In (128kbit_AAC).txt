[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what we're smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Malibu
Pure Kush Ambrosia from Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, it says this product
contains 72.9% THC and 87.4% total
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I crack open the jar, it smells just
like a really good Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're familiar with Kush, that is what
this smells like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Kush with a little bit of sweetness.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not familiar with the Kush
aroma, it is a hint of gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some skunkiness to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bit of feet in there,
and there's an overall funky aroma,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I completely enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout-out to my friends at
Apothecary Farms for the delicious Malibu
[SPEAKER_00]: Pure Kush Ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the point of the show where I
generally do shout-outs to the friends who
[SPEAKER_00]: support the show on Patreon, but before I
do that, I feel like I've got one more
[SPEAKER_00]: thing to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may sound like I'm a little bit not
enthusiastic today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sound a little bummed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a little bit bummed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got bad news.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one of my uncles passed away
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's heartbreaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: My uncles, I wasn't raised with a dad
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: My uncles filled that role, so I've got a
lot of love and respect for my uncles,
[SPEAKER_00]: and of course, my grandpa.
[SPEAKER_00]: My grandfather filled in a big part of
that father role.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had three uncles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all teamed up and filled that father
role for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two of them have passed away in the past
three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a hard day, but I can't sit here
and cry about another uncle being passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would want me to do my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd want me to get on the microphone and
put out some love to you guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that's what I'm gonna do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I sound a little shaky or if I take
a couple of breaks, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking missing my uncles, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys listened to the other episode
I did right around Christmastime,
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about my other uncle who passed
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that episode, I tell a story of two of
my uncles being in a Chevy El Camino
[SPEAKER_00]: driving me to a concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in the back of the El Camino.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a camper shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: They smoked the joint up front.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the smoke from their joint ended up in
the back of that El Camino with me in the
[SPEAKER_00]: camper shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was stoned as fuck, and they took me to
my first concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an amazing experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: They played Metallica's The Black Album on
that trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is why I am a drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two guys are a lot of wives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of my sense of humor and my
smart ass personality from my uncles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of my playfulness from my
uncles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That came from those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that came from my gramps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of my rebellious personality and
my rebellious attitude came from my
[SPEAKER_00]: uncles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The uncle that passed away today was the
other dude that was in that El Camino with
[SPEAKER_00]: my uncle Eric on the way to that concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those two dudes were around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were really influential in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today is gonna be a little bit weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next couple of days will be weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I assure you that I will be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all of the messages,
all the emails, all the Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: messages, all the text messages that will
come from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know my uncles would not want me to
sit around and cry and have a sad day over
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would say, go smoke a joint and do
what you gotta do, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're gonna do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a couple of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sat around for a minute and thought
about life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it is time to get my shit together and
do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is quarantine time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's locked down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are relying on me for quality
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get the show on the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the part of the show where I give
shout outs to a few of the folks who
[SPEAKER_00]: support the podcast via Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off by rolling a big fat
joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's light that fucker up and pass that
over to my buddy, Ruelighting Tim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's roll up another fat joint,
light that bitch up and pass it over to my
[SPEAKER_00]: buddy, Keith K.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna pack a big fat dab for my buddy,
Nick Dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's load up the bong with some sticky
green herb for my buddy, Learning and
[SPEAKER_00]: Burning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a big fat fresh bowl over to my
buddy, Blackbird76.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's roll up a big fat blunt and fill it
up with some rosin for my buddy,
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Toe Grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's roll up a big fat joint and wrap a
snake of shatter around that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just put some shatter right around
the outside of a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's pass that fucker over to my buddy,
ZosoJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I wanna pack a fresh bong low to put
some keef on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll light that one up for my buddy,
Kes Burton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's roll a big ridiculous joint and dip
it in keef for my buddy, Victor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's get crazy and bake a big batch
of super potent edibles and pass those
[SPEAKER_00]: over to my buddy, Steve F.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then last, but certainly not least,
I wanna roll up a big Cheech and Chong
[SPEAKER_00]: sized joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna put a bunch of shatter down the
middle of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna light that bitch up and we're
gonna pass it over to my buddy,
[SPEAKER_00]: GrimBullTheDruid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks, big shout out, big fat dab to
everybody who supports the show on
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to learn how to support
the show, all you have to do is visit www
[SPEAKER_00]: .patreon.com forward slash grow from your
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did include a link in the show notes
to make it easy for all of my stoned
[SPEAKER_00]: friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I feel like I've got
my head back in the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's deliver a quality podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off by saying thank you to all
of the people who sent me a response to
[SPEAKER_00]: episode 518.
[SPEAKER_00]: 518 was six years of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of wonderful emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of Instagram messages and
YouTube got so many wonderful comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all of the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all of the love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all of the interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only does that stuff help me stay
energized for the podcast, but in times
[SPEAKER_00]: like these, when I've got family
emergencies and family tragedies,
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff really helps me keep my head
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got so many friends out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got countless friends and internet
homies and grow buddies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all the support on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, the next note I have written
down says, stay at home orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a couple of nights ago, I got a text
message on my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more like an amber alert type of a
service, an emergency service alert,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it said that Colorado has been issued
a stay at home order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, the entire state is grounded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you are doing essential activities
or your job is considered an essential
[SPEAKER_00]: job, you are ordered to stay at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless you are going to work or grocery
shopping or going to the dispensary or the
[SPEAKER_00]: liquor store, you have been asked to stay
at home and the times that we are allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: to travel to the stores and the liquor
stores and dispensaries have been limited
[SPEAKER_00]: basically to normal business hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are out after those hours,
there is a good chance you will be pulled
[SPEAKER_00]: over and you were supposed to present a
letter from your employer or some type of
[SPEAKER_00]: document that shows you can be out because
you were traveling to and from work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a really strange time we are living
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have very mixed emotions about this
restriction, about travel restrictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rebellious Rastafarian in me the
rebellious teenager in me, the rebellious
[SPEAKER_00]: human in me says they say I cannot go
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to go outside and do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do want to go outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I have been stuck inside for a
few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to just go somewhere where
there are more people and just high five a
[SPEAKER_00]: few of my friends and say what is up,
bro, and just do that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is why I have got mixed emotions
about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go outside, we are going to keep
passing this virus around like a
[SPEAKER_00]: volleyball.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we go inside, there is nobody to
volley the ball around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have got mixed emotions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not like being told stay the fuck
inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also do not like getting sick and I
do not like watching people around me get
[SPEAKER_00]: sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are on these stay at home orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is very strange.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is so quiet at night that I have a hard
time sleeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to turn on movies or a TV in
another room and have some sort of chaos
[SPEAKER_00]: going just so I can sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that is some sort of sign about who
I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it is too peaceful, my brain and
body will not sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up in a very loud neighborhood,
a very loud area.
[SPEAKER_00]: My area now is kind of loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not super bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am one or three blocks away from the
main street.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is noise lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: No noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is fucking creepy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is like a scary movie that has been
creepy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned essential businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said unless you are going to the
grocery store to get groceries or you are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to the liquor store or the
dispensary, you have been requested to
[SPEAKER_00]: stay home.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few other cases you can travel
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go to the hospital or the doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you need prescriptions, you can do
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is very limited travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amazing and interesting part is the
state of Colorado has deemed medical and
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational cannabis as essential
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So until further notice, we are still able
to purchase medical and recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, concentrates, edibles,
topicals, all of the other things that
[SPEAKER_00]: were available at the dispensary are still
available at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few different protocols in
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are shopping at a medical,
marijuana dispensary in the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado during this weird COVID-19
quarantine lockdown period, at a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary, you are still allowed to go
into the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are allowed to walk in the store,
but you are kept about seven or eight feet
[SPEAKER_00]: away from any people that work in the
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not allowed to touch anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not allowed to really put too much
of a visual look on the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ask you to set your money on the
counter and then they push it into the
[SPEAKER_00]: cash register with their gloved hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't even really touch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want any interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put your product at the very end of
the counter in a bag and they basically
[SPEAKER_00]: ask you to get the fuck out in a real
polite way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's efficient shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody in there is decked out in like
Tyvek suits and scrubs and face masks and
[SPEAKER_00]: goggles and gloves and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like you're buying drugs from
aliens or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit weird, but the medicine
is still available and I find that to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: blessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that to be very progressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That people can still get their medical
cannabis during this sort of a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the recreational dispensaries are
still open, but they are now offering curb
[SPEAKER_00]: side service.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very new thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something Colorado did not want in
the beginning of the cannabis revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in these times we have adjusted to the
curb side service.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you need to do in most places is
contact the dispensary where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's via the phone, via an online
ordering service, you give them a heads
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You drive through the parking lot 15 to 30
minutes later.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already identified your vehicle and
your license plate number.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make sure that you're 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're 21, they take your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give you your order.
[SPEAKER_00]: They run back into the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make change out of the money you gave
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came back and give you your change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're all set to go with your
recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people were confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a question if you could sell
recreational cannabis to a 21 year old
[SPEAKER_00]: adult.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they had people under 21 in the car and
it was deemed sell the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as there is somebody 21 in there,
that is the pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the ticket that says, yes,
you can do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can do it, give them the herb,
let them have their day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make it difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to make things easy for people
in this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really find it to be a blessing that the
state of Colorado has deemed cannabis as
[SPEAKER_00]: an essential service.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is amazing to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also appreciate it because many of my
friends work in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without that being open, more of my
friends would be without jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited that at least a few of my
friends have gotten to remain employed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I also mentioned that the liquor
stores are open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people may say, why is the liquor
store open?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not a medicinal need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I agree that there are several
reasons why we should keep liquor stores
[SPEAKER_00]: open.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first reason I agree is I like to
smoke cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say drug of choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my thing of choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to drink alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made me act like a complete asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know plenty of people that can drink and
behave themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know plenty of people that smoke
cannabis and turn into fucking dipshits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do what we enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like cookies, you like cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like cannabis, you like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like alcohol, you like alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody turns to something in this type
of a situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be the TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be video games.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be books.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all choose something.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't be judgmental.
[SPEAKER_00]: I choose a lot of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dab a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people choose alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am glad that there is something like
that open for some sort of a, we were
[SPEAKER_00]: calling it a pressure release valve.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're stuck at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of us may be stuck with people we
don't really want to be stuck with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of us, maybe you want to be stuck
with them for two or three days,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're going on over a week now where
we've been stuck in a home with these
[SPEAKER_00]: people and you may just want to choke a
motherfucker out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a little pressure release
valve, you may feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you guys can drink a couple of
drinks and laugh it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can put on some Netflix and
giggle it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you could take a few dabs and laugh
it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe other people eat a bunch of fucking
cookies and just chow down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how people deal with things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all got our own approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's wonderful that they have
kept the dispensaries open and the liquor
[SPEAKER_00]: stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people argued liquor stores were not
essential in times like these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any sort of an escape is essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also if you take an alcoholic and you
make him dry out involuntarily,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is going to cause emotional problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could cause physical problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could cause medical problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those people will have more problems
trying to sober up in this fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: stressful environment if you force it on
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just let them have their drinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure that there are some people
out there that if we cut off their alcohol
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, cold turkey, they'll go into
withdrawals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll have seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll have problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to do that to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to keep essential services
open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am proud and excited that we are
progressive enough here in my state to
[SPEAKER_00]: have recreational and medical dispensaries
as well as liquor stores open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not a drinker, so I'm being really
open minded and accepting that the liquor
[SPEAKER_00]: stores are open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody else has their own shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the video game players,
they're at home just killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, oh, you mean I can't go to
work for two weeks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch me level up on every fucking game
I've ever bought.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're having a good old time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the musicians, they're like,
oh, now is the time to go learn that rush
[SPEAKER_00]: tune I couldn't figure out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's doing their own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all got our own.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to call it an addiction or an
outlet, we're all doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's great that they've kept
some of our outlets open for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, with that being said, I am still
trying to ration my concentrates to an
[SPEAKER_00]: acceptable level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am trying not to panic shop and panic
buy concentrates when I go to the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my shopping routine has been
disrupted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not regular.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are extra steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like everybody out there is
carrying the plague now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing personal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just feel like if I'm near you,
you're going to get me sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm trying not to go to the dispensary
any more than necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stocked up a little bit, trying not to
clean them out of anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I got enough to last me what I think
will get me through a week or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm still trying to ration it because
I don't want to go too crazy and smoke all
[SPEAKER_00]: of my concentrates and have to go out
there and face the dispensary line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've got enough groceries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've got enough concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got butane.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually got the e-nail sitting on
the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't use the e-nail very often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friends at Bee Nails.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the bee nail, the rig and the ceramic
nail, this is a great setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Ali over at Bee Nails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all of the support,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great people over there at Bee Nails
support them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am trying to be prepared for
whatever comes ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may decide that we've got to stay on
lockdown even longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm trying to be prepared, trying to
think forward, trying to make the best of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I have gotten so much shit cleaned
up while we're on this little quarantine,
[SPEAKER_00]: while we're on strike or while we're on
restriction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been cleaning up all the random shit
in my house or in my grows or in my
[SPEAKER_00]: spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh, there's that little mess
that I've been looking at going,
[SPEAKER_00]: one day I'm going to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been one day for the past couple of
days here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been getting a lot of shit done.
[SPEAKER_00]: That feels kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you guys catching up on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing anything with this time or
are you one of those guys that's just
[SPEAKER_00]: beating every video game on the planet
right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you scrolling on Facebook?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you shit posting on Instagram?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you taking advantage of this time
off?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all got to be stuck at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're lucky enough to still be
employed and get to go to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't complain right now if you are
required to go to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be excited because in a couple of months
you'll be one of the only people getting
[SPEAKER_00]: paychecks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of people out there that
are going to be fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to be grateful for that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what are you doing with this time?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a lot of time to spend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you hanging out with your family?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a moment and be that
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take these stay at home orders
seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quit going and infecting other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live with other people,
that is your crew now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your gang.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lock in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Live with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: No more people in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said it a minute ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: This virus is like a volleyball.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, whoever is out there,
they're batting the volleyball around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a bunch of volleyballs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all fucking flying all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of people just keeping
them in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the people that went inside were not
playing volleyball.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've given up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all those balls were not smacking back
in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're landing and they're dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the people out there smacking them
around, they're keeping the volleyballs
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just passing it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they would go the fuck inside,
the volleyballs would quit getting
[SPEAKER_00]: volleyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The virus would quit spreading around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, we could stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The longer there are people out there
fucking around, the longer we have to stay
[SPEAKER_00]: inside and try to keep ourselves safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people that listen to this are smart
enough to realize to take these orders
[SPEAKER_00]: seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said before, I've got mixed emotions on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like being told what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also don't like dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also don't like wondering if I'm
carrying a deadly disease that could kill
[SPEAKER_00]: my mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, let's take this shit
seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take ourselves seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just take care of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the fuck was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we doing with this time?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spend some time with your family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spend some time cleaning up some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, now is a very good time to calibrate
and clean all of your equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: People forget to calibrate their pH
meters, their PPM meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calibrate all of your shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it can be calibrated, why not do it
today?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to a podcast,
chilling out, get up, put in an earbud so
[SPEAKER_00]: you can still hear me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go clean some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go calibrate some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's got a filter on it, now is the
time to clean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your air conditioner probably has a
filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got any kind of filters,
clean them right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are running an auto-feed system and
you've got one of those filters that hangs
[SPEAKER_00]: at an angle, take that thing out of there
and scrub it down real good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is a good time to clean your
reservoirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is a good time to clean all of your
tables, clean up all the cloners,
[SPEAKER_00]: clean everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, why not inventory all of your
nutrients and reorganize your mixing and
[SPEAKER_00]: storage area?
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be surprised at what you forgot
you bought and you keep buying a
[SPEAKER_00]: replacement because one time you bought
one and you set it in a stupid spot and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna find like a $90 product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna go, oh shit, I kept buying
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you've got the exact product sitting
right there on the shelf or sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath something or maybe behind
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me, I'm speaking from experience
because just a few days ago, I drove to
[SPEAKER_00]: the growth store for one specific product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up buying a bunch of products
while I was there because that's how I
[SPEAKER_00]: shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not get more shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I got home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was unloading all of my shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cleaned up a shelf and on the bottom
shelf right underneath some other stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: was the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I had originally gone to the store
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ended up costing me a couple of hundred
bucks just because all the impulse
[SPEAKER_00]: shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my point after a long ramble is clean
your shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a bunch of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not clean some shit up?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got some dead leaves in the
room, clean those up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got some soil you spilled
somewhere, clean that shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got some trash that needs to go
out, now is the time to get rid of all
[SPEAKER_00]: that bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I'm going to mention is make
sure you have got all of the supplies you
[SPEAKER_00]: need for the next few weeks and also,
if you decide to do any upgrades or while
[SPEAKER_00]: you're cleaning, if you decide to improve
anything, make sure you've got the shit
[SPEAKER_00]: you need before you start creating a
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may be on limited shopping and limited
supplies right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if your growth store is open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in Colorado, we are very lucky
because agriculture has been deemed an
[SPEAKER_00]: essential business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of the larger growth stores are
still open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the mom and pop shops aren't open,
but if you need some emergency stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: you may be able to get it at the big box
stores at the big grow shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may have what you need, but think
about that before you go doing a project
[SPEAKER_00]: or cleaning some shit up or doing anything
that may need replaced or don't break
[SPEAKER_00]: anything right now, please, because you
may be limited on what's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of stuff online is sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of stuff is on limited shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazon is trying to keep up, but they are
overloaded right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't get packages out quickly
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may take longer to get the shit that we
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's be prepared for that sort of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am actually rationing drumsticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I am doing with some of this time is
I've been playing the shit out of my
[SPEAKER_00]: drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen to the show a lot,
you know that one of my other passions is
[SPEAKER_00]: music and playing the drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've played the drums for over 25 years at
this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've got a pretty good grasp
of what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a loud drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smack the shit out of my drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am breaking about a stick every three
days at this rate, maybe two sticks every
[SPEAKER_00]: week, which is not going to sustain me if
we are locked down for too much longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got to mellow down and quit being
a beaver and quit breaking the fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: sticks, or I'll be out there using fucking
bamboo from the grow trying to rock out
[SPEAKER_00]: like I'm John Bonham.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got super high before this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being very therapeutic for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like hanging out with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recording feels very good to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good way to let some shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for putting up with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more thing I want to talk
about for this little kind of an impromptu
[SPEAKER_00]: lockdown episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not at all what I had planned for
this episode, but I like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was spontaneous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing I'm going to talk about
that we can do while we are locked down is
[SPEAKER_00]: we should be listening to more podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many people out there we can
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many shows we have not been supporting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many comedians that need our help right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many musicians that need our help right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go check out some comedians and
musicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we can, maybe send a buck or two to
their Patreons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also discover some new podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for another podcast,
I would definitely recommend The Dude
[SPEAKER_00]: Grows Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave me a huge shout out on their
podcast a couple of days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I should return the favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out The Dude Grows
Show podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is on Apple Podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: A respectable podcast can be found.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to open up my phone and look at
my podcast app here just so I can
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend some more cannabis related
podcasts for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I would always recommend the
Cannabis, what is it called?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Cultivation and Science by Tad
Hussey.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one is a little bit more in depth
than my show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may lose some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will be blown away by the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that is Cannabis Cultivation and
Science by Tad Hussey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also recommend a show called Shaping
Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire is a wonderful podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shango Los does a great job hosting that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there is The Podcast and of course,
The Growcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we cannot forget The Adam Dunn Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Adam Dunn.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's up in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets a lot of great guests on his show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to give him some love and respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, do not forget about the Bloom
Booster podcast that is hosted by Q Grows
[SPEAKER_00]: from Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to make sure to
recommend another show that I am on almost
[SPEAKER_00]: every other Wednesday during this lockdown
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been on there every week,
but I participate in a show called
[SPEAKER_00]: Embracing Organics on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: We record every Thursday at 7 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain Time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what time zone you are in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is 7 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain Time Thursdays.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go for about two hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those shows are left up on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't catch us live,
you can watch the replays on YouTube at
[SPEAKER_00]: any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that show is called Embracing
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a lot of stuff for you guys to
listen to during this lockdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Support my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Support the artists that entertain you
while you're stuck, while they're stuck,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand many people are out of work
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people are struggling just as much as
the artists, musicians, and wait staff and
[SPEAKER_00]: service industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can help some people out,
send them a buck.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can help out your favorite
comedian, send them a dollar because they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have any gigs right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can help out your favorite
musician, send them a dollar because they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have any gigs right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also listen to and support more
podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I am super rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess this one was more for me than you
guys, but I hope you had a good time too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to wrap it up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all of our friends that
support the show on Patreon.

[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been the night that you loved me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put me in my place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Caught you in a stranglehold, baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been across your pants.
Caught you in a stranglehold, baby.
You've been across your pants.
Caught you in a stranglehold, baby.
You've been across your pants.
Caught you in a stranglehold, baby.

[SPEAKER_01]: You've been across your pants.
Caught you in a stranglehold, baby.
You've been across your pants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caught you in a stranglehold, baby.
You've been across your pants.
Caught you in a stranglehold, baby.
You've been across your pants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Caught you in a stranglehold, baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on, come on, come on,
baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, come on, come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that brother's a bitch now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know you can't turn it around.
Running my house gets me in the way.
You know I'm burning down.
You ran that night that you left me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put me in my place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got you in a stranglehold, baby,
and then I crossed your bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on,
come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
