[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode number 71 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_01]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_01]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, This My Friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to the Mystic Roots Band for
[SPEAKER_01]: letting me use their music on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks to Cat Coupe and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are listening to the doggy dub
off the album The Constant Struggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check those guys out for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Mystic Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send them some love.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on, guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: I am coming to you all by myself today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not have a guest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do an episode about ways to
improve your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: One way to improve your garden is to use
organic soil amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you get organic soil amendments?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get your organic soil amendments
from the Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: The organic portions of this episode were
brought to you by my friends at the Rocky
[SPEAKER_01]: Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Visit the Rocky Mountain Worm Company in
Colorado Springs to get your fresh worm
[SPEAKER_01]: castings, African Nightcrawlers,
Red Wigglers, and all of your organic soil
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Rocky Mountain Worm Company has
Dragonfly Earth Medicine products in stock
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Rocky Mountain Worm Company will ship
to your door.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get the same worm castings and
many of the same amendments that I use in
[SPEAKER_01]: my garden through www
.rockymountainwormcompany.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check that out today.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you visit the store, it's at 411
Tijuana Street in Colorado Springs,
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you let them know that you heard
about the show through the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to all my friends at the
Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get much further, if you guys
are interested in sponsoring the show,
[SPEAKER_01]: send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growfromyourheart.hotmail.com and
I'll get you all that information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to take a second now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to turn down that music and we
are going to read an iTunes comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take me a second to get
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a couple of clicks away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it went away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to search for it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't play the opening music and have
this up at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just not a multitasker.
[SPEAKER_01]: My computer didn't like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're both coming from iTunes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had to leave the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I'm going to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I promise I'm just talking while I do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ratings and reviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to scroll down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to turn to the music as soon
as I get to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, check this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The latest review says from iTunes by Mr.
Minor.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was left on April 23rd.
[SPEAKER_01]: He left me a five star rating and it says,
I found this podcast recently and I just
[SPEAKER_01]: love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff is articulate, thoughtful,
considerate, and he has a deep knowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: base that he shares selflessly.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a true gem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love plugging in and kicking back while
listening to all the information and fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. Minor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely appreciate you leaving a
comment and saying that you love the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really great that you notice I am
sharing this selflessly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten a lot of credit for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took me a long time to learn this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm bettering the plant and
medical marijuana and recreational
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana by teaching everybody to grow
better cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's my goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for noticing is what I'm trying to
say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the five stars.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, thanks for the comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, leave a comment on iTunes and I will
read that on a future episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't want to leave a comment on
iTunes, you can go to Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go to Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can email me.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of ways to get in touch
with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at GFYH podcast or search for Grow
From Your Heart on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to follow me on Instagram,
it's at iRegenetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of social media stuff there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to talk about our main subject for
the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk a little bit about ways to
improve your crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I opened my phone, I just saw the most
terrible tweet, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate to be the bearer of bad news,
but the legend ... I'm going to kill the
[SPEAKER_01]: music here and say this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm making sure this is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's true, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to tell you this on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've already heard this because this
episode is going to come out in a week
[SPEAKER_01]: from now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But BB King has passed away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blues legend, BB King is no longer with
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a really brief moment of
silence for BB King.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'll tell you about my favorite BB
King performance I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take just to brief this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't do a long moment of silence,
but this is for BB King.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was out of respect because BB King,
I'm a huge musician.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've played music for my whole life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been a drummer longer than I have not
been a drummer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got drums for my 15th birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all I cared about for probably 10,
maybe 15, 20 years was the drums.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all that mattered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I had a daughter and that changed
some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to play in a band called the
Chromebenders with a guy named Brian
[SPEAKER_01]: Ritchie and Donovan McNeely and Kenny
Nicholson.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were other guys that rotated in and
out of that band, and our bass player was
[SPEAKER_01]: Dennis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't forget the bass guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were several guys, Dennis Morgan,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are several guys that rotated in and
out of that band, but Brian Ritchie and I
[SPEAKER_01]: were always in that band together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to do The Thrill is Gone,
which is a BB King tune.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, we would play the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: BB wrote amazing songs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to talk about my favorite BB King
musical moment that I've seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not get to see BB King on stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were so many shows that I chose to
go to that I had to skip some.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a lot of Fish and Moe and
Widespread Panic and stuff along that
[SPEAKER_01]: lines, but I skipped all the BB King
chances and now I kind of regret it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw him on the HBO 25th anniversary of
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember the exact title,
but those words are in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the 25th anniversary, the Rock and
Roll Hall of Fame.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stevie Wonder's band performed and several
musicians came out and performed with
[SPEAKER_01]: Stevie Wonder's band and they do a montage
and then they bring out BB King and they
[SPEAKER_01]: did The Thrill is Gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some moments in that song when
the hair on the back of my neck stands up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an amazing performance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, guys, BB King is gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to BB King.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody like him on that guitar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a minute, listen to some BB,
feel some blues.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not want to see that on the phone
there right during a show, but they give
[SPEAKER_01]: me some content, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thrown off now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Death is never a comforting feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ways to improve your crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's change the vibe of this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ways to improve our crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one major way to improve your
crop and you guys are going to say you're
[SPEAKER_01]: a seed reader.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course you say that, but this is why
I'm a seed reader.
[SPEAKER_01]: A reason, a way to improve your crop is to
use high quality genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a clone from somebody you trust that
has ran that clone and it's a clone that
[SPEAKER_01]: you know is going to do well so that
you're not wasting your time, wasting your
[SPEAKER_01]: space, wasting electricity, money,
nutrients on a plant that isn't worth a
[SPEAKER_01]: shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a good quality stream, good quality
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I'm going to recommend some iry
genetics, some rare dankness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like gauge green genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: La Plata Labs, those are just a few of the
brands that I really trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are just a few off the top of my
head that if I were going to grow from
[SPEAKER_01]: seed, those are the guys I would grab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gauge green, La Plata Labs, they're
friends of mine and I trust their shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Iry genetics, of course, is my brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I trust my shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get some good trustworthy genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can go to Kindlove in Denver,
they quite often have great genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: available.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have the lemon Jeffrey available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get yourself a clone of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll grow some amazing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ways to improve your crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, use quality genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part B to that is learn those genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't expect to pull off an amazing
cannabis cup winning crop the first time
[SPEAKER_01]: you grow a strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to learn it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants want different shit at
different times.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to figure out what
the temperature and humidity is for that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant that is ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to figure out how
long it takes to flower it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Develop a relationship with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you've got a relationship with that
plant, you can really start dialing in the
[SPEAKER_01]: room, the nutrients, the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use quality genetics and learn the
genetics you're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number two, ways to improve your crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: This sounds like a no-brainer,
guys, but label everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wouldn't believe how many times I
thought, I'll remember what that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then later on in the future,
I don't know what the hell that clone is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now I'm trying to grow some random
clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to wait and see what it looks like
when it flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to smell it, figure out what the
hell it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Label everything, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, this is number three,
but it's also kind of part B of number
[SPEAKER_01]: two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're labeling shit, take a lot of
notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take notes of when that clone was cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take notes of when that clone went into a
cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take notes of when that clone went into a
pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take notes of when that pot is up potted
into a bigger pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take notes the day it went into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I write down every feeding that I mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I write that shit down so that if I see
something amazing, I know what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't forget what I did last time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make a lot of notes, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if you do any supercropping,
any tweaking of the plants, any topping,
[SPEAKER_01]: any pinching, if you use any bug sprays,
any shit like that, just write it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way, when you have amazing results or
shitty results, you have a record to look
[SPEAKER_01]: back on, and you can look through the
notes and go, oh, look, dude, here is
[SPEAKER_01]: right where we fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can find it, you can identify it,
and you can correct it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So label everything thoroughly and take
notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's something that sounds obvious to
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've noticed a lot of people are
ignoring this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work as a consultant, and people in my
neighborhood can call me and invite me to
[SPEAKER_01]: their house, and I do charge a small fee.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will come look at your garden,
wherever it is, and I will give you a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of advice or correct your
issues or your problems and help you get
[SPEAKER_01]: back on the right track.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I often see is people do not pay
any attention to the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you are mixing up your nutrients or
your reservoir of clean water,
[SPEAKER_01]: before that goes into the water,
or into your pots of plants, the pH needs
[SPEAKER_01]: to be adjusted.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using organics, ignore this,
because the organics, you'll kill the
[SPEAKER_01]: organics by using anything to adjust it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The organics will buffer themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll work themselves out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me, guys, I'm burping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'm better now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're using synthetic nutrients or
bottled nutrients, make sure you pay
[SPEAKER_01]: attention to the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is super critical in hydro and really
important in soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either way, pay attention to your pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you mix up your water, when you mix
up your nutrients, you want to have that
[SPEAKER_01]: final mix come out about 6.5 before you
pour it into your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fill your thing with water,
put the desired nutrients in there at the
[SPEAKER_01]: desired amount, check it with your PPM
meter, if you're even using one of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another thing to pay attention to,
your parts per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about that in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check it with your PPM meter, then put
your pH meter in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably gonna be a little bit high
still.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to get it down to about 6.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're gonna need to add something,
probably a pH down product, to that just a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mix it up again, put your pH meter in
there, and do it until you're about 6.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, if you're going hydro,
you might want to go 5.8, 5.5-ish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not the hydro expert yet, so don't
quote me on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am definitely learning hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely learning quickly on the hydro,
because it's all we're doing at the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pay attention to your pH, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see the problems in your leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: When your leaves start doing stupid shit,
it's usually because of pH, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: that's gonna mimic other deficiencies,
and you're going to try, you're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: think, oh, I've got a CalMag deficiency,
or oh, I've got a nitrogen deficiency,
[SPEAKER_01]: when really the only problem is that your
pH of your feeding is off, and your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want to drink it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your plants will react by showing you
problems, and you'll try to correct
[SPEAKER_01]: problems that don't even exist,
and then you'll probably create more
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys, make sure the pH is correct
of your feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, something I should add to that,
I'm gonna skip ahead a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: where is this note?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, I wrote a lot of stuff, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use clean water.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something I can really stress
right now, since we're talking about pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use clean water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most grows will recommend RO water,
if you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's reverse osmosis water, but that
does require kind of an expensive
[SPEAKER_01]: filtration system, and if you're just
doing a small home grow, it's a little
[SPEAKER_01]: ridiculous, but the big growers will
definitely recommend reverse osmosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got, at the spot dispensary where
I'm the grower there, we've got several
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand gallons of reverse osmosis water
being cleaned all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wouldn't believe the water tanks we
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got, I think there are four 1,000
tanks in the RO room, and they stay full,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we pump that into separate rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each room's got four 250 gallon tanks in
it, which is where those dump into.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're using a lot of RO water in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're unable to get RO water,
a good idea is to fill your reservoir,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then put an air stone, an air pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't put the air pump in the water,
you guys, put the air stone in the water,
[SPEAKER_01]: put a little tubing to the air pump,
plug the air pump in, and that will
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygenate your water, and what that will
do is it'll bring the water that's at the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom to the top, and it'll push the
chlorine and whatever else they're putting
[SPEAKER_01]: in our water now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll clean that out for you a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll bring it to the surface,
and the chlorine has to make it to the
[SPEAKER_01]: surface to evaporate, so putting some
oxygen in there will definitely help you
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to do that for at least 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always good to get the chlorine out
before you mix any nutrients in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: or especially if you're making an organic
tea, it's definitely a good idea to try to
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble out that chlorine as long as you
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've almost always got a big, it's the
Brute trash can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a trash can on wheels,
and then I've got a little area with a
[SPEAKER_01]: little set up of water net, or a little
bubbler set up next to it, and I just fill
[SPEAKER_01]: that trash can up, and then I roll that
over to this area, and I just drop the air
[SPEAKER_01]: stones in it, so it's almost always filled
with bubbling water, and then I can mix
[SPEAKER_01]: into that if I need to, or I can make
smaller portions in five gallon buckets
[SPEAKER_01]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that if I need to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just try to keep that clean water on
hand all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of skipped around on my notes,
but this is gonna help us out.
[SPEAKER_01]: This gets me back on track here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said have that water prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: My next note is plan ahead and have your
rooms ready, and allow time for your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants to recover from topping and
training.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's two things in one there,
but plan ahead to have your rooms ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna have plants that are vegging,
and they're gonna start getting too tall
[SPEAKER_01]: and shit, and you're gonna be like,
I really need to flower these.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when you're gonna wish that you'd
planned ahead and thought about this room
[SPEAKER_01]: is gonna be done at this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: This area will be done at this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: These plants will need to go here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really try to plan ahead and think about
what you're gonna do with each plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're gonna do it, and that's a good
time for me to tease and let you know that
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been working on the episode about
scheduling a perpetual grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran into a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know how to deal with the fact
that I don't know how many lights you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: have, so how the hell am I gonna write a
schedule for your grow rooms?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm juggling it around, and I think
I've got the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just gonna kind of condense it and
make it a small grow, and then you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: can expand on it if you hang more lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're gonna have to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was talking about planning ahead,
having your rooms ready, and then the
[SPEAKER_01]: second part of that was allow time for
your plants to recover from topping and
[SPEAKER_01]: training.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're gonna talk a little bit about
topping, training, supercropping,
[SPEAKER_01]: scrogging, tomato cages, using sticks for
supports, and LST a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be just, I don't have any notes
on this, so I'm just gonna ramble about
[SPEAKER_01]: this part for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all methods that we would use to
control the shape of our plant and the
[SPEAKER_01]: height of our plant and also to improve
the yield of our plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: By keeping the plant, instead of growing
one huge cola that sticks up and then
[SPEAKER_01]: having the rest of the plant kind of low,
we wanna kind of eliminate that one huge
[SPEAKER_01]: cola and make a nice canopy so that the
plant is getting even light and that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's not one bud blocking everything
and taking up all the light and making
[SPEAKER_01]: shadows.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanna get one nice canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ways to do that are topping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked about it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the plant starts to grow nodes,
so you've got your main stock coming up
[SPEAKER_01]: and you've got a bunch of intersections,
those are nodes, all those branches that
[SPEAKER_01]: grow out, those are nodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go down a few nodes and cut out the
main center stock, you have just now
[SPEAKER_01]: basically topped your plant and you've
created multiple tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis wants one main top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of the small tops that were subtops
will now start creeping up and try to
[SPEAKER_01]: become new dominant tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's topping a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't really explain it much better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just grab the top, go from the top
cola and then just go down and then keep
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of look, like kind of if I cut it
here, how many branches are gonna be left
[SPEAKER_01]: and is it gonna be kind of even?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can, don't be afraid to fuck
up a couple, but don't go fucking up a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of top one and see what you like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut off a little bit at a time because you
can cut more, but you can't put shit back
[SPEAKER_01]: on plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's topping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Supercropping is kind of, I learned
supercropping from a guy named Soma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Supercropping is when you kind of take the
stem of the plant and I rub it between my
[SPEAKER_01]: fingers to soften it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I pinch it a little to crack the
stem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I honestly just push the branch
right over at a 90 degree angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I had one branch that was growing
taller than the rest of my plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would find a spot just a little bit
lower than the rest of the tops and I
[SPEAKER_01]: would just break that branch right there
and bend it over at a 90 degree angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for about a day, it's gonna look like
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna look like it might die.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the next morning when the lights come
on, you'll go in there and look and that
[SPEAKER_01]: branch will be perfectly horizontal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be broken, bent at a 90 degree
angle, perfectly horizontal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the end of it will start growing right
back up again toward the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you've kind of straightened that
out so that you'll have a more level even
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also, where that branch was broken,
I think it'll be a little bit stronger
[SPEAKER_01]: than it ever was before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a little bit of what
supercropping is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Supercropping is also, I will grab the
main stock of the plant where it comes out
[SPEAKER_01]: of the soil and I'll put two fingers on it
and then I'll put two fingers above there
[SPEAKER_01]: and I will twist it and pop that branch
until I hear a crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I will move my hand, the hand
that was on the bottom, I'll put it right
[SPEAKER_01]: above the other hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I'm just grabbing up a little
higher and just crack again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll take my left hand and put it
right above my right hand and crack again
[SPEAKER_01]: and then put the right hand above the left
and crack again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's where I've cracked up this plant like
10 or 12 times right up the main stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what this does, it'll make little
knuckles in there and those are,
[SPEAKER_01]: they toughen up that stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: That main stock will get a little bit
stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a thicker stock that's a
little bit stronger also can move more
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients and it can also support bigger
branches which also can support bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: buds in the future and that's our goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can also do this to branches as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will grab the branch and just turn it
just a little bit and you'll hear crunch,
[SPEAKER_01]: crunch, crunch and you're just breaking
that cellulose wall in there so that it
[SPEAKER_01]: has to rebuild.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like you're popping your
knuckle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll freak you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try not to do it too frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to let the plant heal from it
once you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you've got time and space to veg
and you're trying to keep your plants fat
[SPEAKER_01]: and healthy, super cropping is a really
cool way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's also talk a little bit about
scrogging.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about scrogging when we had
Spence on.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all mostly canopy management
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about this with Spence here but
I'm gonna go over it again with you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scrogging is when you use the screen or
the net and you let your plants grow and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you kind of put the screen on them
and push them down and then they just
[SPEAKER_01]: flatten out and then they start growing
through the screen a little bit and you
[SPEAKER_01]: try to get one cola through each part of
the screen and then you get that nice even
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy because our goal is to have an even
canopy instead of one big cola.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want a bunch of small colas that get
even light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just helps out for the grow and those
big buds aren't extra valuable or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're actually kind of a pain in the ass
for the grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've talked about super cropping,
topping, scrogging, tomato cages.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like to use a tomato cage,
you guys, because in a seven gallon pot,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of those, I think it's an 18 inch
around tomato cage, it's a nice top and
[SPEAKER_01]: you can get, if you top the plant twice,
you get about eight good heads off of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and you got just enough space around
that tomato cage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use the cage to support the buds
and you can also use the cage to pull the
[SPEAKER_01]: buds apart to get more light.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you spread those branches apart,
you get more light to each bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to use that square footage of your
light space a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I put the tomato cage on early and then
I let it veg with the cage on and then I
[SPEAKER_01]: start pulling it out and strapping it up
to the edge of the cage just to make room
[SPEAKER_01]: in there and then you can use the cage to
keep it supported or you can tie it into
[SPEAKER_01]: the cage to keep it up or you can tie it
outside of the cage to keep it apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cage just really gives you a lot of
opportunity and support and it's very
[SPEAKER_01]: versatile too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I've talked about using bamboo
sticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times I'll just get some bamboo
sticks in there, shove those right into
[SPEAKER_01]: the dirt, tie the branches up to there,
pull them apart a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are good ways to get more light to
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So topping, supercropping, scrogging,
tomato cages and just using regular sticks
[SPEAKER_01]: are good ways to pull the branches apart,
get a little more canopy management,
[SPEAKER_01]: get more light down to the middle of the
plant and also I think pulling the big
[SPEAKER_01]: buds apart gives you a little more
airspace and I really like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: LST is low stress, stress training.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of the Scrog method also with
a little bit of supercropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to just kind of bend and twist
the plants a little bit to keep them in
[SPEAKER_01]: the shape you want and keep them low.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trick here is to make the plants low
and bushy so that we can fill space and
[SPEAKER_01]: not use a lot of plants because in the
medical game it's all about plant counts
[SPEAKER_01]: and in Colorado in the rec game you're
allowed to have six plants and they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: care how big they are so you can grow six
fucking house size plants if you know how
[SPEAKER_01]: to do it and a little bit of cropping,
supercropping, LST kind of stuff will
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely do it for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we've kind of gone over the
canopy management stuff so I was really
[SPEAKER_01]: quick on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another part that I can talk about and
we're going to wrap this episode up pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've noticed you guys like the 30 minute
episodes better.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I should really talk about is
pay attention to the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many problems are from the room or the
environment that you've created.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be aware of the day and nighttime
temperatures and the humidity through veg
[SPEAKER_01]: and bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too low of humidity and veg will stunt the
growth of your plants and it'll lead to
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of mimics a deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: When there's not enough humidity the
plants will mimic problems and again
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll be trying to correct something and
really all you need to do is increase the
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So too low humidity will stunt the plants,
lead to deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too much humidity will lead to mildew
issues and it can also slow the growth of
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants and veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for veg try to stay around 50% or above
and maximize out around 75% humidity in
[SPEAKER_01]: veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go a little higher but that's when
you start running the risk of problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to keep it consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the veg stage try to keep temps around
74 to 77 degrees during the day period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anywhere from 77 or 72 to 82 is okay for
most strains but what I've noticed is 74
[SPEAKER_01]: to 77 degrees during the day is prime in
my experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of my plants in veg, 74 to 77 degrees,
they go nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They thrive and keep in mind this is just
the room temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not leaf surface temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leaf surface temperature is a whole other
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about that in another episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the night cycle try to get around
68 to 75 degrees guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll sum that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: In your veg you want your temps 70 to 80
degrees for the day, 68 to 75 at night and
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 to 75% humidity during the veg cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna interrupt myself and talk about
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you walk in your grow room,
if you can smell dirt and soil and pot and
[SPEAKER_01]: moist air and funk, you need more
filtration.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need more air coming in and more air
going out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shouldn't smell like a pot garden in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be a little bit humid and a
little bit sticky but you don't,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you can smell the pot garden in your
pot garden that means your neighbors can
[SPEAKER_01]: smell the pot garden down the block.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can walk in there and it smells
like pot and it smells like soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to get more carbon filters and
pull more air out and then you need to get
[SPEAKER_01]: more HIPAA filters and pull more air in
because you're getting stagnant stale air
[SPEAKER_01]: in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should not smell like an old funky
basement in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should smell clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just a random way to improve your
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're focused on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, my throat's burning up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna take a drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always about 25 minutes guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: The throat starts going nuts and I didn't
stop and take a dab in this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tried to preserve the voice a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just need a guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's get into the flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: For flowering, we need to make a few
adjustments.
[SPEAKER_01]: For humidity, we need to get down to about
40 to 50% humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need excess moisture in the room
because that will cause mold or rot
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have heard about my white rhino
experiences because there was too much
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture in the room and the temperatures
got too low and that invited our mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the bloom phase, it is ideal to
have temps hovering between 74 to 77
[SPEAKER_01]: degrees during the day and 66 to 75
degrees at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting temps too high will slow the
plants down again and too low will
[SPEAKER_01]: encourage mold and rot like I've said.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing a strain that has purple
characteristics, what you can do is you
[SPEAKER_01]: can lower the temps a little bit around
week six or seven a flower and that'll
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely start bringing out the purple
color in your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, that's enough about humidity
and temperatures in your crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you guys understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those basic things will definitely
improve your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple more quick tips before I wrap it
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't spray some shit on your plants in
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your plants are in flower, please do
not spray them with any type of bug spray
[SPEAKER_01]: or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're gonna hit them with a foliar
spray, be really careful and really
[SPEAKER_01]: selective what you spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any time after week three really,
that stuff is gonna end up in your buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, from the beginning of flower,
there's not time for systemic chemicals to
[SPEAKER_01]: get out of your buds or off of your buds
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're spraying something like
fulvic acid and some sea kelp or something
[SPEAKER_01]: to try to increase things, that's not a
bad idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just be careful when you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't spray bug sprays at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't spray neem oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't spray pesticides at all during
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only spray healthy, helpful foliar sprays
and stop those around week five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please, please, please, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also something that I stress a lot to
improve your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flush your plants before harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is involved in planning.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked about planning your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plan 14 days to flush your crop before you
cut it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course, I'm gonna tell you
another way to improve your crop is to
[SPEAKER_01]: cure your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen to the episode about drying and
curing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll really, really help you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dry and cure your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flush it, dry it and cure it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that may help you out guys,
don't bring more people to your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those people you bring in is where your
bugs come from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also here's another quick hint that's
just coming out randomly.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do get a clone from somebody,
quarantine that bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hit it with some bug spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check it for a couple of days and make
sure there are no bugs on it before you
[SPEAKER_01]: introduce it to the general population of
your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: One bug, one russet mite coming into your
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: One russet mite into a new growers garden
could devastate everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your crop that is four weeks into flower
could be decimated before you could save
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your mother plants will be eaten.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your veg plants will be eaten.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have taken russet mites to all your
buddies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't take much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you get a clone, quarantine that
bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't bring friends over to your grow to
show them because they're bringing bugs,
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew, spider mites, root aphids,
fucking white flies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all traveling on your buddies
clothes with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So guys be careful in each other's
gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another tip about your garden,
to make it better, just don't tell people
[SPEAKER_01]: about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you want to show off your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to show off those big old buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make an anonymous Instagram account.
[SPEAKER_01]: Post the pictures to Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tag your friends or something in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just don't make it all braggy to where
everybody knows who you are and what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing because word travels really,
really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I post pictures of my shit and I
talk all about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grow for a facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a different story you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm out of the blue now or I'm out of the
woodwork now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can talk about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm out of the shadows.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I've done about 30 minutes
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's look and see how far we're into
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that 29 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting good at podcasting you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's time to wrap up this show
before my throat goes bananas,
[SPEAKER_01]: before my ADD kicks in, before your ADD
kicks in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we didn't do a dab on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to move the iPhone out of the
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to grab a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do a dab together you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am going to dab some black cherry cam
that was grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I bred this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was I involved in this extraction?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, this one was not extracted by me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is done by my good friends at the
Garden of Weeden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the hash I've had my hands in
making.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can make myself some pretty decent BHO.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you guys to take a dab with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you're dabbing, get a big fat
dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do like a 0.3 here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't kill yourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't get it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go a little bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, now it's troublesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always that limit with the dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like go a little bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go a little bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shit, that's too big.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to grab the E-nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Giddy Up and Emotech.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Hitman Dougie.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do a dab off the Hitman
E-series Sidecar with the highly educated
[SPEAKER_01]: titanium nail hooked up to the Emotech
G-nail from Giddy Up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to all of those people for
making my dabs amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a dab with me you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five, four, three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, carb capping and freestyle
rapping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, 0.3 and no cough because I'm a boss.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else do I have in here?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some platinum OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some Tora Bora.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, shout out to the dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like dabs a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you do too.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next episode you guys is going to be,
you know, the next episode will probably
[SPEAKER_01]: just be rambles and news because I'm still
writing that perpetual grow episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's boggling my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm stuck, but I'm going to get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually had a couple of people throw
some ideas at me and I figured out how to
[SPEAKER_01]: do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to get that together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be back in a few days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a lot for listening you guys.
