[SPEAKER_00]: Exchange event at an undisclosed location
in Denver, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is enough news.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's enough Bill Pang and I'll see you
next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enough advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into the main portion of this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have an email right here in front of
me and it comes from a person named Brett
[SPEAKER_00]: E and it goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, I just signed up
for Patreon and I saw your post about the
[SPEAKER_00]: shout outs and that's great, but you can
use my IG moniker instead of my real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: My IG moniker is no till luma naughty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friend,
no till luma naughty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned it in a previous episode that
when you sign up on Patreon, I will give
[SPEAKER_00]: you a shout out under the name you signed
up under on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the name I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what I read on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easiest for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I've realized that some people
don't want me to say that name that
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got another name.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd rather get a shout out through.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got that name, you want me to
say, send it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do my best to find that message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll flag it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll print it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to correlate that name that I see
on the screen to the name that you've sent
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, it takes a couple of tries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the ADD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the brain thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also I'm high as giraffe pussy half the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will do my best to correlate the
appropriate name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Name to the appropriate shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person right here had the right
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big shout out to our friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: No till luma naughty.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is their Instagram handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them a follow at no till luma naughty
on the Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, shout out to them and
thank you for the support, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next message says this one actually
came from my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you visit my website, I read genetics
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a grow help tab on that website.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can click on grow help.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can send me a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does ask you a couple of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this person basically said,
what would you, what cultivar would you
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend for concentrates?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a podcaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you know me as the grow from
your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also the sole proprietor, sole
breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the guy from I read genetics,
premium seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I also make a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what this question comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because not everybody knows that all
the stuff that I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're asking about some of the
strains that I breed from I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: What cultivar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you recommend for concentrates?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like talking about my
concentrates, about my strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: about my cultivars, about my breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this will get me going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of answers for this
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of depends on what kind of
concentrates you want to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to make bubble hash?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to make BHO?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you squishing stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing it?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to kind of make a difference
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've noticed is the strawberry
starburst always makes super tasty,
[SPEAKER_00]: delicious, high potency concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how you run it, how you press
it, squish it, wash it, extract it,
[SPEAKER_00]: blast it, process it, whatever you want to
call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry starburst will make amazing
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a big fan of rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to smoke rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, and I'm not a hater,
this is my honest opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosin is not for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes like burnt popcorn and popsicle
sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not the turp for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people love rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people love BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people love different types of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are making ... I remember what I
was saying now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a big fan of rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got myself back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend Pedro made some rosin from some
strawberry starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that rosin was some of the most
delicious and potent concentrate I have
[SPEAKER_00]: ever inhaled and exhaled.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the inhale, it tastes like sweet candy,
like almost those watermelon candies or
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry candies that grandma used to
have in a candy dish on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got dusty and shit, but they still
tasted good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tasted like that on the inhale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on the exhale, it was like sweet
bubble gum and kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just stayed on my tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was high as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: My eyes got heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lungs felt heavy from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a Pedro dab of strawberry
starburst rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bred the strawberry starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our buddy Kelvin Medina actually grew the
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Pedro from Pedro's Grow Room did
the extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the strawberry starburst is one of the
best for any kind of concentrates,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I also feel the same way about the
blue raspberry truffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue raspberry truffle makes amazing
BHO concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're making anything using a solvent
extract or a solvent extraction,
[SPEAKER_00]: that blue raspberry truffle will dump
resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it tastes so crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concentrates and the turps are just
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like blue raspberry candy,
blue raspberry suckers, tropical skittles,
[SPEAKER_00]: sour flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just tart flavors in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's cherry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all kinds of funky shit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some just razzy stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then there's another one I talk about
all the time when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorites for concentrates is
the cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cream makes really great bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cream makes really good press hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you make bubble and then press it,
it is tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes out white and beach sandy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something about I'm not a
concentrate maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have experimented and attempted to make
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm better at fucking up a concentrate
than I am at making them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm much better at smoking a concentrate
than I am at making them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I let the concentrate makers do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I focus on breeding, podcasting,
growing other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've got my niche.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know a lot about the science
of extracting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know there are different size and
shape trichomes on plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that the strawberry starburst
and blue raspberry truffle make tall
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes with a big fat head.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something I've seen, something
I've seen under a microscope, something
[SPEAKER_00]: people have noticed and shown to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opposite of that happens with the
cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are short and bulky, almost like
stocky fat boy kind of bowling pin shaped
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're shorter and closer to the plant
and they're wider and more bulbous on the
[SPEAKER_00]: top and they have a fatter head.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some reason, that seems to make a
better bubble hash product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm not the concentrate maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your end of the job,
but I can tell the two trichome size
[SPEAKER_00]: differences, shape differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two strains I mentioned at the first
have the longer, skinnier, taller
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the short have shorter, fatter
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they make completely different kinds
of concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll get like an oily texture out of
some and a sandy texture out of others.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the cream makes like a beach
sand, like a kind of a gritty baby powder,
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of a texture when it comes to making
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my top three that I would recommend
would be the blue raspberry truffle,
[SPEAKER_00]: the strawberry starburst, and the cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that being said, the blueberry
butcher that I just put out, I said
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry putcher, the blueberry butcher
that I just put out also dumps and makes
[SPEAKER_00]: all kinds of amazing concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I breed for that high THC stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I like to get so high that I almost
can't function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I try to, I try to give myself a
panic attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't, if I walk into the mall and
I'm okay, I didn't get high enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to walk into the mall and be like,
fuck, I can't be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way my dad should make me feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I breed for that high intensity panic
attack, fucking head buzz, head ringing,
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking crazy high that you've got your
eyes dart around the room and your heart
[SPEAKER_00]: beats out of your chest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm also breeding for intense flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love good tasting weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed should taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concentrates should taste even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm breeding basically for perfect
concentrate plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I love to smoke concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow my plants in there extracted
immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, today I got to smoke some
concentrate made from a plant that I bred
[SPEAKER_00]: and that a friend grew who'd rather remain
anonymous.
[SPEAKER_00]: But bro, you know who you are in those
concentrates were fucking delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I grow my stuff with concentrate
production in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I breed with concentrate production in
mind because that's what I prefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to smoke flower, but dabbing is
where it's at for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a busy guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also been smoking for fucking 25 years at
least now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my tolerance is off the charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to smoke a pound of weed to get a
nice buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could take six dabs and be fucking
wrecked if I do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really like dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got myself way far off track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would I recommend for concentrates?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the cream, strawberry starburst,
blue raspberry truffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can get your hands on it,
that blueberry butcher is a great one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find the blueberry butcher at
SeedsHereNow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that you use coupon code GFYH10.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll save you 10% on your full order
sneaky commercial right in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm going to move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one does come from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you for the question about the
cultivar also.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do get seeds, I want to know
how it runs for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to know how the concentrates
come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what strain you choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know how you extracted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know if you were satisfied with my
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll get you my address.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can fill me up with some concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one does come from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says what up rusted Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been listening to your podcast for
over two years since I started my grow
[SPEAKER_00]: journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to say thank you for the
motivation and the knowledge you gave me
[SPEAKER_00]: to continue to give countless Oh,
that you gave me and you continue to give
[SPEAKER_00]: countless new growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great way to start a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been listening for two years,
which thank you for following along for so
[SPEAKER_00]: long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I didn't annoy you and run you
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the motivation, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the motivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a two way street.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put out content, you listen to it,
you say thank you and motivate me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know your garden's getting better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a two way street.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for the motivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got this knowledge in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was blessed by what created me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know, I believe in Rastafari.
[SPEAKER_00]: So John gave me this knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I didn't share it, I would be
disrespectful to myself to jaw and to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was given a gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got this gift of gab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got this gift of learning of teaching
this obvious gift of a green thumb and I
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy cannabis with a passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I didn't put this back out,
something would go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would spontaneously combust.
[SPEAKER_00]: John would say you're being selfish with
your gifts and strike me down in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thunder lightning brimstone, all that good
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just try to share the gift I was
given.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's in me and it would be selfish
not to put it back out there and it feels
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very rewarding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to teach you how to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you say thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you guys send me money on
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's fucking tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really good relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really good, I'm grateful for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't feel dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done things where I've walked away
and been like, yeah, I got paid,
[SPEAKER_00]: but kind of feel like a piece of shit
inside for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel like a piece of shit when I
do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This feels good.
[SPEAKER_00]: This feels right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this is where I'm supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big up, big thanks for noticing
Rastafari.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get myself back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and that I can, uh, countless new
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love knowing that I'm helping countless
new growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every fucking couple of months we get a
new state legalized and that's a full
[SPEAKER_00]: state population of new potential growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm down to help every one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it says, um, where were we?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you're genuinely, genuinely helping
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I fully support that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it wouldn't be too much, it would be
cool if you could shout out my YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: channel, Rasta green thumb, as I basically
make videos off of your teachings started
[SPEAKER_00]: last year due to the pandemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: My new life mission is to get this
valuable knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: To as many people as I can, and
particularly the minority community who's
[SPEAKER_00]: been oppressed heavily from bullshit
cannabis laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: I respect that, uh, being a white
Rastafari.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got a lot of friends of different
colors, uh, from different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, just being an American person,
being a Rasta man has nothing to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I love people from all different
colors, cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love accents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love fucking vibes from everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, man, if we didn't have people from
other places, this country would be boring
[SPEAKER_00]: as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was just all one color people or one
type of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shit would suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate what you're doing for,
uh, uh, minorities and trying to help
[SPEAKER_00]: people out and get to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, uh, who've been oppressed heavily from
bullshit cannabis laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and so thank you for doing what you
can for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, you're kind of just spreading
my teachings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, give me some shout outs, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know where you learned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everything is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you, uh, acknowledge your
source, give your teacher some credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can share my knowledge, all you would
like, let them know to listen to my show
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You give me a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been following for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my buddy Ross, the green
thumb, check them out on the YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does follow up with, I've got an actual
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, when it comes to breeding,
if you were to breed with the strains
[SPEAKER_00]: you've already made, which ones do you
think would make something amazing?
[SPEAKER_00]: If combined such as Raphael and orange,
Gazum making a strawberry orange kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: Terp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it says, I plan to breed seeds in
the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to use your high standards of
testing them as well as picking good
[SPEAKER_00]: parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, would you be opposed to me making S
ones of some of your strains and giving
[SPEAKER_00]: them to people in my personal discord that
need help getting seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to touch on the making S ones of my
stuff before we talk about your breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll remember to dust this
microphone off before I record another
[SPEAKER_00]: show that things dirty and embarrassing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it is cool with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you make S ones to give to your friends
in need that, uh, can't like afford seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: acquire seeds and get seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you become, uh, when it becomes a bad
idea is when you're stepping on my toes,
[SPEAKER_00]: stealing customers, uh, just kind of
fucking with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to make these seeds and
give them to people who are in need,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is respectable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you've got my permission and my
respect for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't cross the line and sell those seeds
and make S ones of something that I am
[SPEAKER_00]: putting out and then try to piggyback off
of that shit and make a dollar off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a dick move.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like what you're trying to do is
totally cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to help people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to help people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If my strains become S ones and help
people that is improving people's quality
[SPEAKER_00]: of life, making people's lives better,
uh, letting you help people, you do that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but don't be a dick move and put them on
the market and sell them as a lemon,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeffrey S ones or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just being a dick move.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, it's not going to work for you
anyway, but still in a, in the community
[SPEAKER_00]: and the seed breeding realm, that's,
that's where the border line is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to give them away,
I'm cool with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them away, but don't go making money
off of my creations, which I know that
[SPEAKER_00]: sounds weird because you're like,
bro, you just make seeds off of other
[SPEAKER_00]: people's strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do some work with it, but I've done my
own research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've developed my strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just making photocopies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's already somebody out there doing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're not going to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had to make that disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: No worries on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so if you're going to make S ones and
give them away to people in need,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make S ones and then profit off of
my work, uh, that you're just piggybacking
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a dickhead move.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're not going to do that because
you say, take care brother made job,
[SPEAKER_00]: provide you with many more blessings and
bless up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shows me your respectful Rasta man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to do that to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the main part of your
question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to breeding, if I were to
breed with strains I've already made,
[SPEAKER_00]: which strains do you think would make some
amazing, something amazing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you ask about Raphael and orange
Gazam making orange strawberry kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds great, but honestly,
it sounds like it's so many sweet and
[SPEAKER_00]: tropical things are going to cancel each
other out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's already a lot of stuff already
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, that's already been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's Tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all the Tangy crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's Tangy Bananji.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a strawberry banana Tangy that's
already been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the Tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could go back in time here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to be careful not to
bottleneck yourself when you were
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I know the family history,
the family trees of these tray of these
[SPEAKER_00]: two strains, Raphael is a blueberry
cookies to strawberry fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry fields comes from Crockett.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, orange Gazam is golden goat to
platinum Tangy platinum Tangy is platinum
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies to Tangy Tangy is back over here
in Crockett's camp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have to carefully research the
strawberry fields and the Tangy and see if
[SPEAKER_00]: they have similar parents, because if so
they've already been, it's already been
[SPEAKER_00]: done.
[SPEAKER_00]: That cross is kind of, do you see what I'm
saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they already, if Crockett owns both
those parents, he's probably already done
[SPEAKER_00]: that cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need for me to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if I'm going to breed, so if I use
that strawberry, there's a strawberry,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, fields in there and the Tangy in
there, they probably already have a parent
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to breed with something
that's got a similar parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not going to do me any good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just with a little bit of quick
thinking about my family tree,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, Raphael to orange Gazam would just
basically be remaking some Crockett shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I need to stay further away from that
to be original.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to rewrite stairway to heaven
fucking zeppelin already did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need to use the same chords and play
it differently or fucking not play those
[SPEAKER_00]: chords at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just don't want to recreate
something that Crockett did or something
[SPEAKER_00]: so close to Crockett's camp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you probably didn't even
realize that there was strawberry fields
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's from Crockett and there's Tangy in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's from Crockett.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're just playing with two of
Crockett's things all over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a respectable breeder, that's
Crockett stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He should, if anyone's going to cross
those two, it should be Crockett.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to go backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is why, uh, I wouldn't cross those
and you got to be careful about
[SPEAKER_00]: bottlenecking yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a similar parent, which I'm
sure there is, I didn't research that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm sure there's a similar parent
between the Tangy and the strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably a Tangy something, probably that
orange Cali.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, is probably in there somewhere on both
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so I wouldn't want to do that because
then I'm just breeding back to that same
[SPEAKER_00]: parent, that Cali.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that is common.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those two is going to come out again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's just not something that would
interest me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, then that's something as a
breeder, I have to be careful about
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is pollinated by King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I want to breed strawberry starburst
to anything, it can't be blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be, but it's not a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going backwards again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of inbreeding cousin fucking,
uh, that's never a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would do strawberry star strawberry
strawberry starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to keep my brain straight here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry starburst to blue raspberry
truffle would have to arise parents in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get a lot of arise traits,
uh, strawberry starburst to sun kiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got arise traits in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got to be careful not to breed
that back to anything that's been done to
[SPEAKER_00]: arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I would look to my blueberry
cookies line or my grateful dog line and
[SPEAKER_00]: breed it to something else that I have
bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a good example of some strains I've
crossed together that have been strains
[SPEAKER_00]: I've created that I've crossed together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the grateful dog is an inbred
feminized project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to talk too much about the
history of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know about that already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Femseed female only.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the keeper, the prize,
the winner of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, then I also made the arise,
which is golden goat crossed to
[SPEAKER_00]: daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, then I took the golden goat and
daybreaker found a male out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pollinated that grateful dog and that
makes my morning do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is, uh, my child, my child and my
grandchildren basically crossing there
[SPEAKER_00]: making stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when I'm able to cross stuff as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I open it up and do things that
aren't all King Solomon or all the Jack
[SPEAKER_00]: the Ripper male or all the grateful dog
male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you want to know, uh, uh, what would
be something amazing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else you think I would be
something else you think I could make that
[SPEAKER_00]: would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Jack the Ripper crosses I just made
are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do plan on finding some males in that
line to go back to some of my females.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will be some, uh, Jack the Ripper
crosses to arise crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack the Ripper crosses to blueberry
cookies crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those things will go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, some of the feminized only stuff to
more feminized only stuff will be fun
[SPEAKER_00]: also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes to breeding, if I were to
breed with the strains I've already made,
[SPEAKER_00]: which ones do I think would make something
amazing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, grateful dog to arise that made
morning do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what else can we talk about lemons?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, lemon Jeffrey to the arise made lemon
sunrise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made both of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there are a couple of the things that
I've made that I haven't even released
[SPEAKER_00]: that are pretty awesome that I'm not even
going to talk about the Kings,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, King cam grape stopper road.
[SPEAKER_00]: G crosses bread to some other stuff were
pretty rad, but the reason I can't breed
[SPEAKER_00]: everything to everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go back to that is because I
will bottleneck myself all work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything will all be Jack the Ripper
cross to arise cross to the same shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why you see me looking for new
males occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why every year or two years I bust
out a new feminized project because I just
[SPEAKER_00]: need a different male plant to open up my
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm limited by plant counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very, very limited by the amount of
plants, which I can have here in the state
[SPEAKER_00]: of Colorado and in the position which I
have put myself in and the community on
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube, uh, everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, my face, if you open, if you think
about cannabis, you probably, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: times my name is associated with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they, whoever they are, Babylon knows
who I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got to follow the rules,
be really careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have an extra leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm allowed 600 leaves, I got 599
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm following the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very limited by the amount of plants,
which I can have now because all these
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations and how fucking known I've
made myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my fault, but that was my choice as
well, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but I'm well known.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of like fucking poster boy now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to be very careful on my plant
counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got the legal amount of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't, I don't want to get rid of
something because if I get rid of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I can't make more seeds of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't breed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the things I've got, I've fallen in
love with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to find another male, I just reverse a
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like a great way to open up my
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then all of my female plants also can work
as female, male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just gives me that many more
options to play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I kind of danced around the
question about what else would make
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, anything with the different male cross
to anything with the different male from
[SPEAKER_00]: my line would be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I would all work very well because
my selections have been very, very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the true Kush cross to add the truth
cross to everything that's true Kush to
[SPEAKER_00]: arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: The truth would make some really super
stinky indica dominant stuff that I wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that chemdale, a chem cross is going
to be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, yeah, I'm kind of rambling about
that because I wanted to dance around
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do approve if you want to make those S
one seeds and pass them out to your
[SPEAKER_00]: friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've no problem with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make money off of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then just think about what you're
doing when it comes to breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you don't bottleneck yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you don't inbreed too much,
unless that's what you mean to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you start pulling out those
traits, uh, from the p the plants that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have a lot of the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like chefing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put two ingredients and two
ingredients are the same on both sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you mix those two bowls together,
those two ingredients are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: dominate the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to be able to wash those
out of the flavor at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are more questions for this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to ramble on for too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got too stoned and rambled a lot in this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of edit points I need
to make sure to catch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's see, where do we go?
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend since the 11
shout out to since the 11 on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says pollination back to 18 six,
my head grower and I pushed out on
[SPEAKER_00]: flipping the cross tent back to 18 six.
[SPEAKER_00]: We both said we, uh, wouldn't this cause
problems after I brought it up?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't cause problems, why and how
many days after pollination is cool to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they're talking about is when I
pollinate plants, when I'm breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: when my plants are only intended for seed
after pollination, I wait a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: days, maybe three, five, maybe seven days,
depending on how the plants react.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will turn my lights back to an 18
and six cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to say, why would you do
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm not growing buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care what the buds look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not worried about trichomes,
buds, flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am 100% focused on making quality seed
for the consumer, which is you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I turn my light timer back to 18 six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because light is the main source of energy
for our plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the main nutrient that our plant
wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the main nutrient, the main source of
energy to make those seeds get big,
[SPEAKER_00]: fat, beefy, healthy, and harden up faster,
quicker and earlier than ever before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm giving them more light they're
using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're getting, uh, six hours more.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting half a day more light
every day than they would if they were on
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that cuts down my flowering time by a
couple of weeks, because they're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: the light they need for growth during the
day hours that they're on.
[SPEAKER_00]: My flowers turn to shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: My flowers look like a fucking mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: My flowers start to revedge.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start throwing out shoots and making
weird shaped leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do all kinds of crazy funky shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not growing for buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not growing for buds at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I throw the buds away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut the plants down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let them dry to a crisp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put on rubber gloves and I go like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do it over the mic so the audio
listeners can hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go like this with the buds between my
hands and they crumble up into dust and
[SPEAKER_00]: all the seeds fall out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run that whole pile of stuff,
the dust, the sticks and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: through a seed sorter and it pulls the
seeds out for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leftover shit that's not seeds is all
trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all goes into compost bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do anything with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been so beat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been so finger banged and destroyed
through the extraction process of getting
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is absolutely useless to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've made edibles out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've made concentrates out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's green.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just been abused.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all that is trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will fuck up your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants will look like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll go back into veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start shooting out shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to make all kinds of crazy
mutated leaves and weird shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not growing for buds at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm talking about is purely a seeded
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only looking for seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you cut those down and pull the seeds
out, show me what the buds look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me what the buds look like when you
have those seeds in your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's ever going to know that those
plants look like fucking aliens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like they're in fucking some
hostage situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the seeds are amazing because they got
more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were able to photosynthesize faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came down maybe three weeks sooner
than the plants that I did not put on the
[SPEAKER_00]: 18-6 cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't puss out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does cause problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes the plants go fucking completely
bonkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But aren't you growing for seeds and not
buds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to focus on the goal here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worry about the outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the process getting to the outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to read the question in my head one
more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure I covered all this stuff here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Head grower pussed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Said it would cause problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what kind of problems, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: No problems, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to make your seeds better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're growing for a flower,
don't do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing for a flower,
wait until the last 10 to 14 days to flip
[SPEAKER_00]: it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're growing with seeds,
do it about three, five, maybe seven to 10
[SPEAKER_00]: days after pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shortly after pollination, it is safe
to turn those lights back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't puss out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have confidence in yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have faith in what I'm teaching you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it goes wrong, send me a bunch of
fucking hate mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me I'm an idiot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blast me all over the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is all I've got for this
episode, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gone for quite a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm quite rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, my throat's getting dry and my ADD
is kicking in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it is time to wrap up this
episode.
