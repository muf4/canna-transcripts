[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what's up podcast world it's your
boy Rasta Jeff coming to you live from the
[SPEAKER_00]: car on interstate 25 That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just left the champs trade show I
thought it'd be a good idea to jump on the
[SPEAKER_00]: microphone and do a little bit of
recording while it's still fresh in my
[SPEAKER_00]: mind So today I went to the champs trade
show in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a beautiful drive It takes me about
two hours to get up to Denver took me
[SPEAKER_00]: about another 20 minutes to find a good
parking spot Anyway, I got a good parking
[SPEAKER_00]: spot I messaged a good friend of mine who
had a pass for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We met up and he got me a password champs
He gave me a high five and told me to have
[SPEAKER_00]: a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had shit to do So he sent me on my way
and I headed into the champs trade show
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys I am failing you right now
because I seriously don't know what champs
[SPEAKER_00]: stands for champs is an acronym for
something I don't know what it means
[SPEAKER_00]: CHAMPS it means something about glass and
trade show because what it was was a trade
[SPEAKER_00]: show based on glass cannabis and It's some
of that shit said for tobacco use only but
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco and cannabis smoking accessories I
saw So basically it's all your shit that
[SPEAKER_00]: is available at all the head shops that
you go to depending on the quality of your
[SPEAKER_00]: head shop But it was all there all that
plastic shitty Chinese Smoking accessory
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff was all there all the shitty Chinese
knockoff glass was there all of the shitty
[SPEAKER_00]: knockoff Nail companies were there but
also Some of our good friends were there
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys I got to visit the hitman booth
if I was Man, if I didn't walk away from
[SPEAKER_00]: the hitman booth today, I was going to
spend a lot of money with hitman They had
[SPEAKER_00]: two rigs that I was really interested in
they had the mini they have the new I
[SPEAKER_00]: forget what they call them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call them a Sunday stack or something
like that It's not the Sunday cup,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's this little stack thing the mini
stack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got they had water in it They let me
pull through it that thing felt like it
[SPEAKER_00]: was Hit like a champ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately you guys there was no
consumption in this venue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were not allowed to smoke any type of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't dab There was actually
somebody pressing out rosin dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a rosin press if you know about
rosin it's made by squishing your buds
[SPEAKER_00]: between Two heated surfaces using
parchment in the middle as some way to
[SPEAKER_00]: catch your hash He was pressing out rosin
right there for you So you could bring
[SPEAKER_00]: your nugs and get them squished is what
they were calling it Some people were
[SPEAKER_00]: taking dabs of that right after they would
squish it all the time So it was frowned
[SPEAKER_00]: upon and if you got caught they would
escort you out of the building So anyway,
[SPEAKER_00]: I met up with the hitman crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fell in love with a couple of rigs They
had a mini sidecar rig with a blue label
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue label was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my favorite color my exact favorite
color blue Unfortunately, I just bought
[SPEAKER_00]: the same rig with a yellow label So I
could not bring myself to spend another
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred and fifty dollars on a rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although a hundred and fifty dollars on
that rig was a steal I just didn't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy a copy of a rig that I have already
got didn't Not make sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so I had to walk away before I
bought the Sunday stack and before I
[SPEAKER_00]: bought the blue mini sidecar They had a
bunch of great rigs at the hitman booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I made friends with a bunch of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Also got to bump into our crew with oil
slick Josh from oil slick and the oil
[SPEAKER_00]: slick crew was there in full force They
sent me home with the sample of the I
[SPEAKER_00]: forget the official name of it I've been
calling it the bong condom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a It's basically a condom
you put on the mouth Piece of your bong so
[SPEAKER_00]: that if you're at a large party or an
event you can swap those out So that not
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody has to get the we call it the
cup cough or the wook flu So they gave me
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of those to check out Right

microphone for you and share you some
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas that he's got He's got some amazing

[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a guy gave me an edible to try
But I'm not going to do a shout out on
[SPEAKER_00]: that or any review until I'm able to sit
down and look at The packaging and eat it
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm driving on Interstate 25 going about
70 miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nobody else out on the interstate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just me It's a Wednesday night.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty mellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually driving through Monument
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the city of Monument and
shout out to that cop that didn't pull me
[SPEAKER_00]: over a few miles back I'm full on talking
into a microphone and that cop did not
[SPEAKER_00]: pull me over and that's pretty killer So,
let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've done all these shout outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize if I missed anybody It's
nothing personal big shout out to Adam
[SPEAKER_00]: hand for throwing me a pin big shout out
to Everybody that I hung out today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize if I skipped you I want to
move on to this next part you guys I was
[SPEAKER_00]: gifted from a vendor a G pin mini
disposable It's called the G pin
[SPEAKER_00]: disposable vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a battery already in it You're
supposed to use it until it dies and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you're supposed to throw it away So it's
got instructions of press the button five
[SPEAKER_00]: times to turn it on unscrew the mouthpiece
loads load with your desired I think it
[SPEAKER_00]: said essential oil is what it said on the
packaging And then it said screw on the
[SPEAKER_00]: cap and then it said press the button and
inhale So I was gifted this it's a yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: G pin disposable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the concentrate version I have
followed the instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I unscrewed I loaded I turned it on I
screwed it back together now you guys we
[SPEAKER_00]: were going to press the button and we're
going to inhale and We're going to see
[SPEAKER_00]: what kind of draws we get off of the G pin
disposable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's check it out right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's dead silent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's shitty for podcasting but I
Loaded it with New York City diesel live
[SPEAKER_00]: resin that I got from Spence from the
Garden of Wheaton big shout out to Spence
[SPEAKER_00]: and it tastes really good But honestly,
I didn't get a bit of smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's lighting up like it should let's try
this again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give it another pull
[SPEAKER_00]: So honestly, I just got some hash in my
mouth, which tastes really good,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's no smoke and It's not working
the way that you would really expect a
[SPEAKER_00]: hash pin to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Packed it down properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes with a little little poker so you
can I got live resin in my mouth I came
[SPEAKER_00]: with a little poker so that you could pack
it down in there and it's packed down in
[SPEAKER_00]: there It's pressed against the coil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used plenty of hash pins in my day
And this one so far two hits in I'm ready
[SPEAKER_00]: to throw it out the fucking window If I
hadn't loaded it up with some decent New
[SPEAKER_00]: York City live resin, it would be out the
window of the car by now So what I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: do I'm gonna hold it Upright to where the
hash will melt into the coil when I press
[SPEAKER_00]: the button and I'm gonna let it melt for a
couple of seconds I'm doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's lit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be doing its thing So now I'm
hoping that I've melted the hash down
[SPEAKER_00]: gravity wise into the coil and I'm gonna
hold it to where it you know what I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where the Fucking hash is melting
into the coil while I hit it I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: give it a give it a third try and we're
gonna see how this goes So, excuse me for
[SPEAKER_00]: one second.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get more silence, but I'm gonna try
this Hopefully we don't end up with hash
[SPEAKER_00]: down my throat while I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: driving No smoke and a little more hash in
my mouth so We will try this again on an
[SPEAKER_00]: episode at home when we're in the house to
where we're not driving in the car trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to do this but so far the disposable G pin
I Find it to be a fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you Press it five times to turn it
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see 1 2 3 4 5 it flashed it went off
I'm gonna set that in the seat next to me
[SPEAKER_00]: next to the microphone case and We're
gonna say fail on that for now You guys
[SPEAKER_00]: got to take a quick drink because I have a
bunch of chunks of wax Stuck in my teeth
[SPEAKER_00]: got a live resin in my mouth So we've been
going for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me just one second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna set down the microphone I'll
edit this out, but I need to take a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got because of that pin I've got melted
wax in my teeth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I might edit a few seconds of
that out I apologize guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd take a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing like having hash smeared
across your two front teeth That was
[SPEAKER_00]: weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so where was I I was talking
about the champs trade show, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys champs trade show was at the
Denver Convention Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was free They make it seem like you
need to be some sort of a vendor or have
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of a license to get in there but
honestly, I don't have Well, I do I have
[SPEAKER_00]: an LLC and shit, but I walked up and said
hey I'm here and they said what company
[SPEAKER_00]: are you with and I said I was with my
buddy Tim and he didn't even say anything
[SPEAKER_00]: I said I'm with organ tica and they looked
at Tim and Tim's with organ tica And so
[SPEAKER_00]: they said what's your name?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said Rasta Jeff and she wrote my
name on a little tag and handed it to me
[SPEAKER_00]: No questions asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't cost me anything champs is a
free event if you're in the industry If
[SPEAKER_00]: not, all you gotta do is have a good
reason to be there and tell them that
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why you're there If you have like a
wholesale license or something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can definitely get in if not You've
got a friend that has a way to get you
[SPEAKER_00]: into champs if you want to go It's free
which is a good thing because it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: really worth a whole bunch of money to
walk through there It feels like a $5
[SPEAKER_00]: ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't complain It was a cool event.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nowhere to sit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's illegal to Medicaid in the building
It's illegal to consume cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_00]: building.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't even hit a vape pen They did not
like that Of course, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: there were a couple of people taking a
couple of rosin dabs But they would have
[SPEAKER_00]: been escorted out had they been caught It
was a great event.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a good time The best part for me
honestly was linking up with a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: people from the industry What up,
Anthony?
[SPEAKER_00]: What up, Johnny B?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I forgot you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not mean to skip you I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: We spent some time together hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost fucking spaced it You know why
because our conversation was just friendly
[SPEAKER_00]: and natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't something that had to be
Documented.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a good conversation,
which I love so shout out to also Jonathan
[SPEAKER_00]: can't yeah Jonathan dude and And Dan
that's who was with John.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah bit a whole bunch of people saw me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was I saw them It was fun hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my favorite part was meeting up
with people in shape Taking hands and
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing everybody is a really really good
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a great place to go If you're in
the industry, you know a few people You
[SPEAKER_00]: can buy a lot of great glass at very great
discounted prices I saw some beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful glass, but you guys honestly,
I'm not into buying really artful glass
[SPEAKER_00]: lately I've been buying what they call
production work and functional glass
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just clear and hits like a champ I
hate it when I spend hundreds to a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand dollars on a nice rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to put the microphone down here cuz
a car just Give me one second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Just didn't want that car to see me
talking into the mic I hate it when you
[SPEAKER_00]: spend a lot of money or your friends spend
a lot of money on a rig and you can only
[SPEAKER_00]: put Like a really certain amount of water
in there because one drop more it splashes
[SPEAKER_00]: in your mouth and one drop less It doesn't
perk right I find that to be really
[SPEAKER_00]: annoying on a custom-made piece So I buy
production pieces that are clear and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think they hit like a fucking champ you
guys I think there's nothing wrong with
[SPEAKER_00]: having a clear rig You don't even need to
spend a lot of money on a rig you guys you
[SPEAKER_00]: could have spent 40 bucks on a really nice
rig Today and been set up you could have
[SPEAKER_00]: got a highly educated titanium nail and a
carb cap for a really good price Champs is
[SPEAKER_00]: a great place if you're looking to come up
on a rig or two or if you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: wholesale license It was really the place
to buy a whole bunch of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so Also, shout out to grassroots
grassroots was there set up in style Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: so for a free event, it was really a good
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great day in Denver It rained a
little bit, but that didn't slow anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: down most of the vendors that I really
appreciated seeing will be at the Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: Cup in Denver or Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm burping They'll be at the Cannabis Cup
in Denver in April if that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's rumors that that may not happen
I'm not gonna start talking shit about it
[SPEAKER_00]: on the show, but there have been rumors
that that won't happen Let's hope that it
[SPEAKER_00]: does most of those vendors will be
available and present at the Cannabis Cup
[SPEAKER_00]: in full force If there's a Cannabis Cup in
your area, I bet those vendors will be
[SPEAKER_00]: there Make sure you look out for oil slick
get an oil slick pad Keep your table from
[SPEAKER_00]: getting all fucking sticky check out
hitman glass hitman makes real Really good
[SPEAKER_00]: glass that hits like a truck every fucking
time when you get new glass, what do you
[SPEAKER_00]: need?
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a new nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who do you go for for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to highly educated titanium.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get yourself a nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a domeless nail and a carb cap I
think that's the way to go Then you need
[SPEAKER_00]: some cool ass t-shirts.

through you go to handmade apparel There's
[SPEAKER_00]: another car on the highway.
