[SPEAKER_00]: And last, but certainly not least,
let's send a big Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast thank you shout out to my friend
Black Hippie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks and big shout out to everybody
who supports the show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not already supporting the show
and you'd like to learn how to do so,
[SPEAKER_00]: all you have to do is visit www.patreon
.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need to support
the show will be right there on the
[SPEAKER_00]: screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I did include a link in the
show notes and the video description to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it nice and easy for all of my
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, welcome to the very first show
of 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope your year is off to a beautiful
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope everything is going your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start with some sad news and
then we will move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, if you're a hip hop fan,
if you're a hip hop listener, a hip hop
[SPEAKER_00]: connoisseur, you lost a major influence,
a major member of the hip hop community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to MF Doom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, MF Doom has passed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may say, Rasta Jeff, why are you
talking about a hip hop artist?
[SPEAKER_00]: We know hip hop's not your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually grew quite fond of MF Doom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran a commercial cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite employees was a guy
named Elijah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're listening to this and I hope
you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you work in my cultivation
facilities, if you were the first one to
[SPEAKER_00]: show up for work today, you get to pick
the music.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a big Bluetooth speaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to link your phone up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You choose the music we're listening to
for the first half of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're there first, that's kind of
your incentive.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times Elijah would show up for
work first and Elijah would put on MF
[SPEAKER_00]: Doom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, I grew quite fond of MF Doom
sound, that smooth feel, very creative
[SPEAKER_00]: lyrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a really nice flow to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lyrics are not always about the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times in hip hop, I hear too much
of the same words, the same story.
[SPEAKER_00]: MF Doom didn't do that to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I grew quite fond of MF Doom's flow and
style and creativity, the beats,
[SPEAKER_00]: his mindset.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoyed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did notice that MF Doom was gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: MF Doom has left the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out, rest in peace, MF Doom.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last episode, I did talk about
cleaning up and preparing our grow room to
[SPEAKER_00]: set ourselves up for success in 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our good friend Mobius sent me a message
and he said, everybody should have a dry
[SPEAKER_00]: erase board in their grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something I highly overlooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a dry erase board in my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a dry erase wall in my
cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you should have some sort of dry
erase board and markers and some alcohol
[SPEAKER_00]: and a little rag so you can clean that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an essential part of your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that dry erase board right against the
door.
[SPEAKER_00]: On one side of the door so you can access
it easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way if you get an idea and the lights
are off, you can run up to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: scribble that idea on the dry erase board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you go to go in there the next
day, it's right there on the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So add that dry erase board to your grow
room to help set yourself up for success
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friend Mobius Grows
for the great update and the great advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, thank you to everybody for the
feedback and the input on the camera
[SPEAKER_00]: settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I'm learning this new camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people said that that last
episode, the settings were perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't change a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that feedback and thank
you for tolerating that episode where I
[SPEAKER_00]: was a little bit blue and purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm learning, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can watch me fiddle with these knobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can watch me reach over and do camera
corrections.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the auto focus in the last episode
was going crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bumped something with my finger on the
screen when I was setting up and the auto
[SPEAKER_00]: focus wasn't what it should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I moved over here, it would focus
on the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I'm learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a team of six people or
anything helping me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find out about the mistakes when I post
the show and you guys tell me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you and please forgive me for all
of my slight mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The content feels good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, everything's coming together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a one man show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, it's just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I've been talking about a discord
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is an I read genetics discord group
on discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will include the link in the show notes
and the video description so that you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: can join the discord group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to everybody who has joined
discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends, gray beard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to lemur priest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, also a big shout out to stabby Mcstab
wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are doing a wonderful job over
there on the discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a big shout out to purple thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple thumb is now a moderator on the
YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you come in talking those jokes,
purple thumb just may use the wrench and
[SPEAKER_00]: ban your silly ass for a little while
because I am too nice to ban people to be
[SPEAKER_00]: quite honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't bother me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a troll, I troll you right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: People in the group have gotten tired of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've given them the ban hammer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, where do we go from here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Go from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is time to jump into the
Patreon questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not, let's not get me rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get right into these Patreon
messages on today's episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to get your questions read
via Patreon, it's real easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join us on Patreon, patreon.com forward
slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a message on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what kind of help you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will get right to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first Patreon question on today's
episode comes from caribou heart organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta, Jeff, I've been
hearing rumors of people being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: tell male plants apart from the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, that's, that's a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, uh, they can tell well
before they even go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any truth to this or does it get
filed under the same category as unicorns,
[SPEAKER_00]: orcs, goblins, hobbits, hobbits,
and people saying they can tell the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between male and female seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's any thought, if there's any
truth there, I've got five beautiful arise
[SPEAKER_00]: babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to try it out on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for taking time out of
your day to set me straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sincerely appreciate this.
[SPEAKER_00]: From caribou heart organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one part I want to touch on before
we go too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, uh, or is it filed under the
category of unicorns, orcs, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically fantasy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when people claim they can tell the
difference between male and female seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people on the internet posting
this chart that says if the seed is shaped
[SPEAKER_00]: this way, it's a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the seed is shaped this way,
it's a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your seed has a volcano shape on one
side or a cone on one side, it's a female
[SPEAKER_00]: or a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Complete bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fall for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't buy into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, anybody with the amount of seeds that
I've got can greatly prove that that is
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you pick whichever seeds you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can roll them around on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can label them male and female and
we'll plant them and we'll check in a few
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to be what you think
they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot identify a male or female seed
by looking at the seed unless you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's a feminine seed,
but that is just cheating anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would still put feminine seeds in
there just to fuck with the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who tell me that they can identify the sex
of a seed by visually looking at the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that part is bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ever believe that you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's move on to the part of this
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, can you tell the sex of a plant,
uh, before it goes into flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some telltale signs that I use
to kind of predict my males and females,
[SPEAKER_00]: but until you actually see pre flower,
there's no way to be a hundred percent
[SPEAKER_00]: sure of what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can send in a lab test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we're in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2021 we're able to get a little card and
you rub part of the leaf material on a
[SPEAKER_00]: card.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even need to send plant matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just kind of smear one of the leaves,
get the juices on this little card.
[SPEAKER_00]: You fold the card up, you write the plant
number, you number that plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: plant a card, a, you mail it off to a lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will tell you if that plant is a male
or female.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is science.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is definitely an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can definitely get our plants sex
tested through science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great way to kind of predict and
anticipate which plants are males as a
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder, somebody who is grown a lot of
seeds, somebody who is looking for male
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times the male plants in the
population are the plants that take off a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit taller and stretchier than the
rest of the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not always a hundred percent
accurate, but 99% of the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you plant 10 seeds and you've got two
or three that are just towering above the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest, chances are those are going to be
the male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: People get so excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, man, this one right here is
growing super tall, super fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go, yeah, it's going to be a boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they get so mad at me when I tell them
that, then most of the time I am correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That male plant wants to get above the
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollen falls down from the male
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he wants to get up above the girls so
that when he pollinates, the pollen falls
[SPEAKER_00]: down and rains onto the female flowers and
they can receive the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is in my theory, why the males tend
to stretch a little bit more quickly than
[SPEAKER_00]: the girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also kind of go into flower a little
bit earlier as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only way we can really tell male
and female plants apart from each other
[SPEAKER_00]: truly is by waiting to see what type of
sex they display.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they put out the balls?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they put out, you guys call them hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really easy way to identify it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you get little balls or do you get
little hairs?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the quickest way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to see pre-flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plant, I spit right onto the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize if you saw that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plant starts to get root bound in
that pot, if it says, hey, I don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: much more space to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got 60 more days to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I better start flowering now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if your plant has been under too little
light, it's not getting enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may decide, hey, I'm not getting enough
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to flower now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you're going to see sex signs
starting to show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not even in flower yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting pre-flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes about 45 days into the
vegetative stage, you can start to get
[SPEAKER_00]: hints of what those plants are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will give you pre-flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not getting calyxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not getting male parts at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're starting to see the development
of those parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of nearing the corner to
where they're going, hey, you could flower
[SPEAKER_00]: me if you wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they start showing you their sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's usually based on pot size or an
environmental stressor, or maybe they just
[SPEAKER_00]: need to get up-potted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they've been growing long enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants will just show you pre-flower
just because that's what they choose to
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times you need to up-pot or put
more light on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the main answer to this question is
you can identify pre-flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can identify sex through pre-flower if
you're experienced, but let those plants
[SPEAKER_00]: go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that they are males or females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them get into flower a few days before
you call the boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them get into flower a few days before
you were committed to thinking that that's
[SPEAKER_00]: a girl and you put it into a trellis net
or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, it comes with experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes with time and learning the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, yes, eventually you'll be
able to tell the difference between males
[SPEAKER_00]: and females by pre-flower, but not in veg,
not at the start, and definitely not from
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that was a lot of rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I answered your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friend, Caribou Heart
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen you following me on Patreon for
quite a while, and I'm honored to finally
[SPEAKER_00]: get one of your questions here on the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a couple of great questions
lined up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one actually came from the Grow
question tab on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to my website, iregenetics.com,
there is a tab that says Grow Help.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you click on that tab, you will have
to fill out a short questionnaire.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like there are about eight or
nine questions on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd ask what strain you're growing,
where you're growing it, what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: lights you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in veg?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: What week are you in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Basic questions that will give me an idea
of what's wrong with your plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: because a lot of times people say,
hey, bro, my plants are yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've got nine questions to ask
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is skipping a step.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to answer these questions before
you can send me the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where this question comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend,
Michael, and Michael is growing Special
[SPEAKER_00]: Queen Number One Femini Seeds from Queen
Royal Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing it indoors under LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in week eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: See all this wonderful information we've
got.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can build a picture on this grow in our
minds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last feed was Medi One, 20
milliliters, Cal Mag, four milliliters,
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish Shit, four mills per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the pH of your last feeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 6.1.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little bit low.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that should work.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the PPM or EC?
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't have that info.
[SPEAKER_00]: The daytime temps are 78.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nighttime temps are 72.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daytime humidity is 53 and nighttime is
50.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we get to the details.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use DJ Short's 1113 light schedule for
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think my last week, my last 10
days, I could do 18.6 and still be
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't afford Patreon right now,
but I do spread the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Michael, thank you for the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not have to support me on Patreon
to be my friend to get help from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate the Patreon support and I
put you at the top of the list,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I do appreciate helping people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like good questions like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great question to answer on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for the great question and
thank you for spreading the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get you some answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michael is using what is known as an 1113
light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That idea came from DJ Short is where I
learned of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ Short feels that by running the lights
on for 11 hours and off by 13 hours,
[SPEAKER_00]: we get better phenotypical expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do tend to agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm running brand new plants,
I'm doing a pheno hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see what the plants really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see more variation from an 1113
light cycle than you would at 1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're really looking for the
details and phenotypes, that 1113 may be
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see more colors, just more
phenotypical expression and more variation
[SPEAKER_00]: amongst a population by running the 1113.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're flowering for 60 days,
you just saved 60 hours worth of
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a benefit to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's over two days worth of lights off
time that you just got.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to help your gear last longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to help your electrical bill be
lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, it's good for the plants is
the main reason that I would do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question here is I've been running the
1113 during flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I do the 18.6 at the end of
flowering?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will that still be helpful?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about the
18.6.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have heard me recently
start talking about putting my plants on
[SPEAKER_00]: an 18.6 light cycle at the end of
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is 18 hours on and six hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are already saying,
what the fuck are you doing to my grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number one thing that gives our plants
energy, that makes our plants grow is
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light is the number one energy source for
our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what creates photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at the end of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend putting the plants on 18.6 for
the last 10-ish days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go shorter, you can go longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very strain dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since you've been on an 1113, I may wait
till the last day or the last seven to 10
[SPEAKER_00]: days to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you can do, put that light timer back
on 18.6.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants are now going to get seven
more hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna get even more than that
because you didn't go from 12.12,
[SPEAKER_00]: you went to 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna get 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna get seven more hours of light
time every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven more hours of photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven more hours of that much energy
pounded into the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get that much more
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a lot of people will say, won't that
make my plants go back into veg?
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're doing this at the last seven to
10, maybe the last 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're familiar with the cut and you're
running a 12.12, you can get away with 14
[SPEAKER_00]: days of 18.6 at the end, but know your
plants before you try to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn that light timer to 18.6 at the end
of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants will get more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get more energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll beef up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get chunkier.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get beefier.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichomes will ripen more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may notice that you planned on doing
that for 10 days, but at the end of day
[SPEAKER_00]: seven, they may already be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to speed you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: My answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think you can still do the 18.6 at
the end of flower, even if you did the
[SPEAKER_00]: 11.13, but only do it for seven to 10 days
because you're going to see a drastic
[SPEAKER_00]: difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting one more dark hour and
you're cutting that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are going to respond to it more
quickly because it's more of a drastic
[SPEAKER_00]: change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that it will be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think it will help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think you need to pay close
attention to these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime we're doing a new experiment,
no matter who recommended it, if it was
[SPEAKER_00]: me, if it was Jorge Cervantes,
if it was Ed Rosenthal, if it was your
[SPEAKER_00]: buddy down the block, always keep in mind
that it's an experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to pay close attention to the
plants because the plants are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you if they're starting to revege.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are going to tell you if
they're freaking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what cultivar you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the rest of your setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know all the details.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that in my environment,
in my conditions, with my experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: this works very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are going to be the boss in
every situation, but I
[SPEAKER_00]: do think you will see benefits in using
this experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm currently in week three of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing in a cocoa pot number 20,
and I always feed until I have 10% drain
[SPEAKER_00]: to waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're getting plenty of runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feed with 1200 PPMs, but I tested my
runoff at 2500 PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you recommend?
[SPEAKER_00]: Straight pH water until the PPM get very
low, and then feed full strength at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or flush with a quarter strength nutrient
until the PPM is lowered?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you have another way of doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so our friend is feeding their
plants, and they're getting a very high EC
[SPEAKER_00]: in the runoff, which could be problematic,
could be non-problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: My very first question to our friend here
was, are the plants upset?
[SPEAKER_00]: The numbers don't matter if the plants
aren't showing any signs of stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants are green and thriving and
making big fat buds and smell like dank,
[SPEAKER_00]: who cares what the numbers on your EC
chart says?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an arbitrary number.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants are happy, don't change a
damn thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I made a little bit of a flow chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made one of those charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, are the plants happy?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it says yes, when it says yes,
or no, I actually said, are the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: upset?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's the way I worded this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are the plants upset?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna go right over to the no chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, don't change a damn thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants aren't upset, if the plants
aren't showing any signs of stress,
[SPEAKER_00]: if there's no reason to change anything,
don't change anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave it just like it is, because if you
do change something, that's when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna cause a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's coming out with a high number,
but the plants are happy, who cares?
[SPEAKER_00]: Make the plants happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we see problems, that is when we can
use those numbers to adjust things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are the plants upset?
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants are upset, it may be time to
rinse them and get all the excess salt out
[SPEAKER_00]: of that cocoa and start fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would do, if the plants are
angry, only do this if you're seeing signs
[SPEAKER_00]: of stress in the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep repeating that, but I don't wanna
mess up a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants could be totally healthy,
and you're just stressed over numbers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and numbers don't matter if the plants are
happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a lot of great gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got monitors that tell us what's
happening in every inch of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can measure EC and PPMs and fucking
temperature and all this magical shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but are we paying attention to the plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who cares what all the monitors and
numbers say if the plants look good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure those plants are happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not growing monitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not growing runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're growing cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if those plants do look upset,
that is when I would flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would feed enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would feed a little bit of medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would feed them with microbes,
and then I would water until I had at
[SPEAKER_00]: least 10 to 20% runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would aim for 20% runoff at this point
because we wanna push all that excess
[SPEAKER_00]: salt, all that extra nutrient buildup
right out of the bottom of the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also wonder if you rinsed your cocoa
before you used it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be contributing to the high EC
and high PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could just be salt from salt water in
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't rinse the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants are gonna start looking like
shit real soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get them rinsed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So use some enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a container of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill it like you just normally would.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your enzymes in there at the
recommended dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adjust the pH to about six two,
six four, maybe six five, right in that
[SPEAKER_00]: range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you say what your pH is?
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't tell me that, but adjust that
pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the pH corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then water those plants to about 10 to 20%
runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you want to, test that runoff and
see where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it still high?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it still low?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's still too high for your liking,
flush again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run that flush one more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it down until those numbers are kind
of low.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how low you want to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what's wrong with your
plants, but you can flush until you get
[SPEAKER_00]: those numbers fairly low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then at that point, we need to feed the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just cleaned out the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing in there for those plants
to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to start starving.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to start cannibalizing
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now is the time to mix up a solid,
balanced diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a good NPK ratio in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have CalMag in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have all the micro and macro
nutrients that you were feeding your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they all in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you mix up a nice mix and pH that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Put some microbes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then feed that to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're kind of reviving them and
re-feeding them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you fed that mix, check your runoff
again and see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't have any issues,
I wouldn't mess with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the old phrase is if it ain't
broke, don't fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you didn't say that the plants are
having any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said that the numbers are bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the plants aren't showing any
problems, those numbers don't make any
[SPEAKER_00]: difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you're not having any problems,
don't change anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're seeing problems in the plants,
put some water with some enzymes in that
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flush it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe flush it twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then pay attention to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to your runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we need to start feeding again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe reduce your feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're feeding 1200 and it's coming out
at 2500, you may be feeding excessively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe increase the amount of runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know the plants are the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what you do, pay attention to
those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't see the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they've got problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they're happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what else is going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the plants are the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, without seeing the plants,
without more details, without that little
[SPEAKER_00]: chart that I do on the grow help tab,
I think this is all of the help that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: able to give you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe lower the PPM of your normal feed if
you're getting a buildup in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe increase the amount of runoff water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, pay attention to those
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it ain't broke, do not fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
