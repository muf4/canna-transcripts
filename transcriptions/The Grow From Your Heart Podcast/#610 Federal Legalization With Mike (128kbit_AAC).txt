[SPEAKER_02]: It is good to have you on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you just took a monster dab right
before we pressed record.
[SPEAKER_02]: But are there any folks?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm feeling a little scrambling.

[SPEAKER_01]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't it cool that we talk into a
microphone, we talk to each other here on
[SPEAKER_02]: camera and then people want to support us
financially.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do appreciate it as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike's all dabbed out and choked up from a
dab, but we do mean it from the bottom of
[SPEAKER_02]: our coughing little hearts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys for all that Patreon
support.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I do look distraught, I do have the
zoom meeting here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at Mike here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The camera's here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The notes are here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dab rigs over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pipe is here.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of pieces of motion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know where my brain is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all these pieces are moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to make a podcast out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys for joining us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, I know we got your Patreon shout
outs out of the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a minute and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so glad to be back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just we've had a hell of a time getting
our schedules lined up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we succeeded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even going to say how many failed
and bailed attempts we've had on trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: record in the past few weekends or weeks,
but we're here and I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what counts.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what matters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking good in that new I read genetics
hoodie there, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Loving it, y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that you were able to check that
merch store, y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great gear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you're even if you're local,
save some shipping money and just will
[SPEAKER_02]: socially distance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just hit up, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, we'll meet you in a parking
lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll use the T-shirt cannon and just
shoot it from a distance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll send my car to yours right
into your car window.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I can shoot it right at you to where
I shoot it on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we do it just right, shoot your new
T-shirt onto you with the T-shirt cannon.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking good, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you came by and picked that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good seeing you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No need to to dig around.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can get talkative.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's just get talkative on a subject.
[SPEAKER_02]: The I wrote down politicians and the
government have been doing stuff again.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only are they getting their house
invaded, they're up to other shit as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even going there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Couldn't resist.
[SPEAKER_02]: These fine folks are taunting us and
teasing us with the idea, with the allure
[SPEAKER_02]: of federal cannabis legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought it would be a good time to
have Mike back on, talk about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike is I'm kind of the grow guy for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got my grow stuff, breeding stuff mostly
figured out, like I've proven in a past
[SPEAKER_02]: episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do make some mistakes and say some silly
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, most of the time I got the growth
to figure out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike is my political guy, my educational
guy, my news guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I brought him on to talk about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Federal legalization opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Figure out what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: What could, what might, what won't happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike is the good guy for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first thing I wanted to mention,
the first thing I know we brought Mike on
[SPEAKER_02]: so that I could talk exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first thing I wanted to talk about,
though, is the coolest thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are going to be let out of prison.
[SPEAKER_02]: In some states, people are already being
let out already.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis crimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in prison for cannabis
possession or something involving
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, people are being let out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is super cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether that's part of the federal
legalization bill, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cory Booker is one of the three main
people leading this charge right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: or at least leading this tease right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's something near and dear to
his heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might see some of that coming down the
pipe federally, but it's definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: happening in different states around the
country.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's beautiful to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's not happening in your state,
write your governor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, especially if you have legal
cannabis there and there are still people
[SPEAKER_02]: in jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say that a lot this episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are.
[SPEAKER_02]: That might just be the name of the
episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're in a legal cannabis state
and there are still people locked up for
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis crimes there, what's the word,
Mike, when we start letting people out for
[SPEAKER_02]: things that they did in the past,
what's the word there, the term for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Humanity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a technical prison word,
the legal term.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've been written.
[SPEAKER_01]: Parole.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's better than parole because you get
something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get fucking freedom, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get let out of prison.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because what you did wasn't a crime and
the rules have changed to where now we
[SPEAKER_02]: feel that it's more humane exactly to let
you out and let you go back, play with
[SPEAKER_02]: your family, be with your friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're out here smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why should people be in jail for something
that some 19 year old girl is fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: doing right over the counter and making a
job and making tax money doing it when
[SPEAKER_02]: there's guys that are other women also in
jail for fucking doing exactly what people
[SPEAKER_02]: are doing at the store now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's great that people are
going to get freed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely hard to defend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keeping someone in jail for selling pot
when they have stores on the corner that
[SPEAKER_01]: are paying for schools.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So states like Colorado and Washington
that didn't lead with some of that in our
[SPEAKER_01]: laws are going back retroactively now in
correcting that continued mistake that we
[SPEAKER_01]: left on the books.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other states, I think Illinois is one that
made that a main piece of their law and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're at least trying and there's a ton
of states, not just federally right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is sort of the main focus of the
show, but there are a lot of individual
[SPEAKER_01]: states that have dragged their feet on
medical and recreational legalization that
[SPEAKER_01]: are now saying, all right, everybody
around us has already done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have only have to drive two states
over to get it, it doesn't make sense that
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't have it here, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I read one I can't remember which
politician, but it was a southern red
[SPEAKER_01]: state prohibition state politician whose
quote was if they'll drive the next state
[SPEAKER_01]: over to get fireworks, they're going to
drive the next state over to buy cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: that we might as well just have it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's it's a little sillier than that
in reality because there's already plenty
[SPEAKER_01]: of marijuana for sale everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: But not everybody has a hookup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not legally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to use my mom as an example.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mom doesn't shop at the dismissal.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's my mom.
[SPEAKER_02]: She wouldn't need the shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if my mom wanted to buy cannabis,
I wouldn't want her to go find one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: guys in the hood.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd much rather her go to the store.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's going to get what she pays for with
a receipt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to say that it's going to be lab
tested and clean and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with the dispensary reports we've been
seeing, that could be a totally different
[SPEAKER_02]: episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so I agree that if my mom had to
had a life threatening condition,
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody in her position, they drive two
hours or four hours to another state to
[SPEAKER_02]: get it other than go plenty of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's easier for her to risk getting
arrested and crossing state lines than it
[SPEAKER_02]: is to go into the hood.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I keep saying the hood just to put the
mental image in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an argument I used to make in front
of city council regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people who everyone agrees should have
ready access to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like somebody's grandma with cancer was
always my example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody agrees that she should have
access to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody kind of understands that she
might not be able to grow it herself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody understands that if she goes to
her doctor and gets that diagnosis,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's unreasonable to say, just suffer
through the chemo for nine months while
[SPEAKER_01]: you learn to grow your first crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe enjoy some relief almost a
year down the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that's unreasonable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you'll have the energy to grow the
crop while you're going through chemo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you'll have a successful crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like yeah, so many maybes in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Michael, let's get this back on
track.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was always my example for why we
should have a store everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they were working at that dispensary
in 2007 and 2009.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2008 showed me so many people that were
shining examples of why medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: should be widely available and affordable
for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were trying to hook everybody up the
best we could.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were a profitable business while
still giving away large quantities of
[SPEAKER_02]: products.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know that it's a viable with all the
new licensing and shit, but still we were
[SPEAKER_02]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I want to put us back on track.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have some questions here and I can
kind of segue into this.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else happens if we federally
legalize?
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, you're my guy to ask all these silly
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now, literally everything's up in
the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Democrats have control of the
presidency, the House, and the Senate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to get all three of those to
agree to pass any new law, like federal
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they built hotels on Park Place and
Boardwalk, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hitch here is Democrats suck with
power.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their first idea is always, let's take all
the Republican ideas first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that usually leads to getting little
to nothing done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I'm afraid is going to
happen here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still sort of monumental that this
upfront in a new presidential term,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're already talking about stuff that's
this culture worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also 40 years too late on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as politics is concerned,
especially in the U.S., legalizing
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is, oh my God, I can't believe
you're bringing that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas everybody in the public is like,
this has made sense for 30 years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should have happened 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they're at least talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The upside is a lot, a lot of people are
interested in it and nothing's set yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They haven't said what they think it'll
look like if they're talking about just
[SPEAKER_01]: moving cannabis from schedule one to
schedule three, if they're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: descheduling it off the scheduled
narcotics list completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that changes what's possible on the
ground where we interact with people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could just move it to schedule from
schedule one to schedule three,
[SPEAKER_01]: which would mean better access to medical
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doctors would be potentially able to
actually conduct human trials so we could
[SPEAKER_01]: give people better dosages, develop better
designer drugs to treat different
[SPEAKER_01]: ailments.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it wouldn't really allow for the
anybody can grow cannabis and sell it to
[SPEAKER_01]: their friend without incurring the wrath
of the local police department type
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization that we all know should
exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be like tomatoes kind of guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be kept a little secure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's less true with tomatoes like is
all so I just put a better fence around it
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep little kids and dogs out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's probably not going to happen
politically, at least not anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the best we can hope for is a
system kind of like Colorado's where it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a little too expensive to get in and it's
much more restrictive than it should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a hell of a lot better than
everything that's come before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just stop arresting people for having
cannabis in a lot of places would be a
[SPEAKER_02]: huge step.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start letting people out of prison would
be a huge step.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then let us grow our own medicine would be
huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: The numbers are astronomical.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're still arresting like half a
million or more people a year for cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: crimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's like growing, moving,
consuming, distributing basic shit with
[SPEAKER_01]: any product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's how we have been living for the last
20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's how many law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how many law enforcement hours were
required to make that many?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What could those cops be doing with that
many hours?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a different episode, but still.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did the math in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: It worked out to like entire years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like a whole cop's career, you could
dedicate to other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the numbers get really big,
really fast when you start doing the,
[SPEAKER_01]: all right, it's two hours per arrest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did 750,000 arrests this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a million and a half cop hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you add in the cop, the court,
the detention officer, the parole officer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The urine test people, the money for all
of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we could have done with that,
that would have helped us a lot more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the, when you start talking to
politicians that aren't interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization or think it's a dumb idea,
and you start presenting some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers, you know, well in our state,
here's how many people we arrest and
[SPEAKER_01]: here's how much that can cost us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what if we use that money to unfuck
the roads or build schools or do drug
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment or homeless outreach or- Clean
up some of this fucking crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's sort of endless.
[SPEAKER_01]: The list of needs that your area,
it doesn't matter where in the US you are,
[SPEAKER_01]: your area needs a lot of stuff bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you go to the city council meetings
or town halls, you'll hear that
[SPEAKER_01]: continuously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to cost 10 bucks to fix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only have three bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only 80 cents can go towards that problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how everything goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can stand up and go,
I know a way that we could bring in $40
[SPEAKER_01]: million a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody stops and goes, how?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they kind of giggle and go,
show me the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden you've got five people
who were against you this morning,
[SPEAKER_01]: arguing with you tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we get it going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which brings me back to write some
letters.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your senators, your house of
representative members.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't know who they are,
you can Google it really fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Emailing them is super easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, I could Google John
Hickenlooper.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would come up with his name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would show me he's a senator for
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I click send him an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It opens up a box.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just type what I want and click send.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hour and a half later, I get a form email
back saying the office has received your
[SPEAKER_01]: email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reappreciate your correspondence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe two weeks later, you get an email
from a staffer that says he's interested
[SPEAKER_01]: in this issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's how.
[SPEAKER_01]: End of email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of arbitrary, especially if it's
just one person doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if 10,000 people all send an email,
that's what they end up talking about at
[SPEAKER_01]: every meeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was your inbox flooded with people
emailing about federal legalization again?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do they all want?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they all say we definitely have to
let everybody who's been arrested for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis crimes go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them all out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just no parole, no probation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So write those letters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever else we want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to interrupt you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put in anything you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me five things that you want for your
federal legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to interrupt you and just derail
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's see what Mike wants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five things.
Me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, first, let everybody go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody you caught up in hassle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them go.
[SPEAKER_01]: To make that not a probable cause for ever
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never want to see another video or have
an interaction with law enforcement that
[SPEAKER_01]: starts getting escalated with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I detect the smell of cannabis or I detect
the smell of burning marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I just I never want to hear those
words ever again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see cannabis stores and all 50
states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd really, really, really like some
of the money to go to youth programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, that's all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can I can respect all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in just a good way to just kind of ask
you what you thought federal would be
[SPEAKER_02]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping like I'm really hoping places
like Colorado that went overboard with our
[SPEAKER_01]: rules and regs dial them way back with
federal legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, there's no reason we should
have an eight store cap across our city.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or a full on moratorium on new cannabis
businesses in the county or 32 layers of
[SPEAKER_02]: paper packaging before I could take a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the licensing like some of that shit's
necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't want the extraction people
randomly blowing up a whole seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want that to happen a bunch of
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so let's make sure the fire department
gets in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: First and make sure everything's safe and
up to code and the walls are fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: plywood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, but for the most part,
like, do it like tomatoes, do it like
[SPEAKER_01]: craft breweries.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a model I like is like craft beer
or beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to say it's cannabis is a flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a medicine and it's an intoxicant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we sell flowers, medicines and
intoxicants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every fucking day in every city on every
street corner, we can figure out a way to
[SPEAKER_01]: comfortably just produce and distribute
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just got to stop pretending it's that
hard and just do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're pretty good at it here in Colorado,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: You and I put a lot of cannabis out
allegedly before cannabis was doing stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of our alter egos may have allegedly
had a lot of cannabis happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we got in the legal market and
exponentially multiplied the amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis we were putting out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a good time in the legal market.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gray market in the legal markets were
like when the period of time where states
[SPEAKER_01]: were afraid to make rules, people forget
the history really fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: When Colorado was just medical,
the feds were saying, I dare you to allow
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking dare you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were still raiding dispensaries left
and right with federal agents where the
[SPEAKER_01]: DEA would show up and smash everything and
take everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people would end up in jail for
the night and then nothing because the
[SPEAKER_01]: locals knew that they couldn't get a jury
to convict.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the feds would just seize
everything and go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like getting robbed,
but you couldn't call the cops because it
[SPEAKER_01]: was the federal police that robbed you.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The drugs are the United States saying he
would take a doctor's ability to prescribe
[SPEAKER_01]: narcotics if that doctor talked,
not recommended, not prescribed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just disgust with the patient,
the use of cannabis for their ailment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just disgust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just fucking talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry for Kirsten so much this
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say fuck a lot on my show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on a roll and I really missed the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: You keep rolling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got questions and I've abandoned
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just doing your thing and I like
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna smoke this bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really have a shot right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if everybody is super easy,
all I gotta do is shoot off a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do it as stone as you'd like to
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can include I'd really like you to add
this to the legalization proposal or I'd
[SPEAKER_01]: really like you to stay away from this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything you want, just please email your
elected representatives, state,
[SPEAKER_01]: federal, all of them, especially if you're
still in a prohibition state.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of places where cannabis is
just as illegal as it was when we were
[SPEAKER_01]: teenagers and that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 2021.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that some people can drive to the
corner store and grab an ounce of herb and
[SPEAKER_01]: go home and other people can go to jail
for decades for having that ounce for sale
[SPEAKER_01]: is just insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three grams of the finest concentrates on
the planet right here in front of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we drove 10 hours that way,
this would be completely a major crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if y'all start having these
discussions, conversations with elected
[SPEAKER_01]: representatives in your area and you get
any pushback, by all means, send us your
[SPEAKER_01]: own email and we'll do episodes on,
oh, they said this, tell them that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike's rebuttal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my wheelhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I love to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I did for a living for a long
time before COVID made me a hermit.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of us are hermits now, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: COVID did that to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of us embraced it and made a video
podcast for our folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You definitely embraced it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The new studio space is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's a little aside,
y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got over there to check it out recently
and it's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to put another microphone on the
other side here.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as we're allowed to play together,
I'll get another one of these Joe Rogan
[SPEAKER_02]: mics.
[SPEAKER_01]: His crazy ass wants to get me over there
in 4K, y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're ready, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry, you'll look good right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one's going to say anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they do, whatever, we can acknowledge
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the best part about the internet,
man, all the haters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to the haters.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know who you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Mike, let's put the show back
on track.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have a bunch of questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything you want to just keep ranting on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to keep going or do you want
me to try to throw these questions at you?
[SPEAKER_01]: When I apologized for Kirsten,
I sort of lost the thread and then I took
[SPEAKER_01]: another hit off the span and now we're
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I took a hit off my bowl here and
got lost as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we're trying to regroup now
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know everything is up in the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing has been solved.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no real fucking rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not even a proposal or a bill yet,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: As that paranoid guy who has always been
like, I liked the black market because I
[SPEAKER_02]: knew that when legalization came here in
Colorado that it would be cool at first
[SPEAKER_02]: and then it would be overregulated,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the word we all like to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the paranoid conspiracy theory
fucking wookie inside of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just straight up what we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an accurate description of life in
Colorado's cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, I'm paranoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you think that I've got two
questions here this could go to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think this will be the lead to like
the dispensary taking over the
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensaries and the grows and the entire
cannabis market?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that will lead to who we will
consider the devil of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that will be Monsanto getting
in to grow the cannabis for the
[SPEAKER_02]: government?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my paranoia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the government already grows
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like the University of Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen the shit that they grow
there, dude?
[SPEAKER_02]: That stuff is terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yo, you people at the University of
Mississippi, if you would like some
[SPEAKER_02]: lessons on how to grow quality cannabis,
I've seen your gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen what you do, but that's fucking
I can absolutely step up your game.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't even charge you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You paid for me to get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll come increase your fucking total
production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything will be 70% better by the time
I leave.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even want any pay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want full credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we'll do a podcast, maybe run some
cameras through that bitch or something
[SPEAKER_02]: just to show that I was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want the credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just your weed sucks, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I may need to bring Mike as my backup
guy to take notes and help me out and
[SPEAKER_02]: shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's my handler because I've got this ADD
issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're going to need someone like me
to explain to the government.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not to be arrested.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to bring Mike as my legal backup.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you guys hire me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll help you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Mike, let's keep going out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The government does grow weed,
but that shit sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they need fucking help doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so bad, I almost think it's a ploy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to keep giving researchers dog
food because if they had real product,
[SPEAKER_01]: they would see the medical benefits like
the rest of us do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're straight up cutting plants out
of the ground and shoving them through
[SPEAKER_01]: wood shippers and calling that fine herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a shop that does that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish that was an exaggeration or
hyperbole.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the major corporations will 100% get
involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: They already are in Canada in a major way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marlboro is really a company called
Ultria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they already have a substantial
investment in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say it's Budweiser.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be a different beer of their
tier, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't pay too much attention to Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the anti-cannabis crowd often
references these, which is why I know it
[SPEAKER_01]: is a talking point.
[SPEAKER_01]: But expect all of them to jump in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Personally, I'm not worried because I know
a couple of things about cannabis that
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those things is if you get the THC
percentage above a certain point,
[SPEAKER_01]: it will fuck up a mass production rolling
machine like you will not believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis and tobacco are wildly different
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: People that don't consume either assume
they're the same with just slightly
[SPEAKER_01]: different effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a lover of both, they are wildly
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the production and distribution of
them is also wildly different because of
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good time to interrupt you and
congratulate you on a year of being
[SPEAKER_02]: cigarette free, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't tell you that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in some dayzage now, but thank you
very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so proud I've made it this far with
zero tobacco, no blunt wraps, no vapids,
[SPEAKER_01]: no nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Congrats, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, that does mean a lot to a lot of
people out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're curious, cannabis world,
I can take way better hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: These pens, I used to get like a tiny
little, your drinks way too hot level sip
[SPEAKER_01]: out of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was trying to cough up a lung.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd get ripped that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would just take 30 coughing fits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I, you see me on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're watching it on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the start of the show, you rip it
continuously.
[SPEAKER_02]: He took a dab at the start of the show and
was able to recover through the,
[SPEAKER_02]: before I was done rambling through the
intro.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: He used to turn colors and fucking
different shades of purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you can really feel how,
it in the lungs, the year off tobacco for
[SPEAKER_01]: sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Congrats, buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm proud of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really am.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we totally derailed the show to
congratulate you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stroke your ego a little bit there,
but I'm proud of you and excited for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just had to be a Ramble cast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was gone for too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: We both knew it was going to go off the
rails repeatedly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody still enjoying this knew it was
too, and they're cheering every time it
[SPEAKER_01]: does.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been going for probably like 30 ish
minutes or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're still listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: They like it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dab at the beginning took away my
ability to judge time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't tell if we've been here for five
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: or three hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got so many timers and things
happening on so many different devices
[SPEAKER_02]: here that it's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was setting up for a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, bye.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a camera there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a Mac book and lights and the iPad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's just so many things for this
show and not, I forgot how to zoom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't done a zoom show in a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Mike, I want to put it back on
the rails.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the chances of us getting home
grows if they do federally legalized
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's gonna, that would be something the
feds would almost 100% leave up to the
[SPEAKER_01]: states.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's sort of what we want in a good
federal legalization is a lot of their
[SPEAKER_01]: answers to questions like that or go,
I don't fucking care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let the states choose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and so it's gonna end up looking kind
of like the liquor market if I had to
[SPEAKER_01]: predict where states like Utah are much
more conservative with who can produce it,
[SPEAKER_01]: who can ship it, who can sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And states like Louisiana can be much more
liberal with who can grow it, sell it,
[SPEAKER_01]: distribute it, all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just depends on where you are and what
the locals want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Personally, I'd really like to see like
the craft beer industry, anybody with like
[SPEAKER_01]: eight grand and some good credit can get
started in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love it to be at that level.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, I really think it needs
inspections and I don't know how many
[SPEAKER_01]: people that listen to this show saw there
was a big report on baby food that just
[SPEAKER_01]: came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you think, oh, baby food,
like if you sell baby food, if that's your
[SPEAKER_01]: bread and butter, like you really give a
shit about what's in your product,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're big business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: They care about money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all they care about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turns out that they've been feeding
kids horrible things for a long time and
[SPEAKER_01]: getting away with it because it's
profitable to do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if the baby food company is going
to put shit in their food and sell it to
[SPEAKER_01]: you, the cannabis company is going to do
it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as much as I always pretended when it
was the black market that, oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: this dude's all organic, like it's totally
hippie grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was all just a marketing thing that
I was told by whoever happened to be
[SPEAKER_01]: selling it to me that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a comforting lie that we all
like to tell each other and believe,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it was always bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like anytime you went to the grow store
and asked a question, they were like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, spray this toxic shit on it and you'll
be fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you don't, they don't even mention
PPE.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, dude, I went,
there was a grow store.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't mention them, but they recommended
me probably 20 different products,
[SPEAKER_02]: sold them to me 20 different times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never once told me, never tried to sell me
gloves, a mask, a respirator, a Tyvek
[SPEAKER_02]: suit, never just a bunch of different
bottles of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only is that wildly irresponsible,
that's just shitty salesmanship.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if it comes in a three piece set,
sell the three piece set.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mike, will this be legalization or
decriminalization if we get this federal
[SPEAKER_02]: movement here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally up in the air still.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guess is if it moves forward at all,
it will be a half step or a quarter step,
[SPEAKER_01]: like federal decriminalization,
which honestly wouldn't be that bad if the
[SPEAKER_01]: feds just said we're out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd really like the feds not to special
tax it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they just did a regular tax level on
it, they didn't add anything because it
[SPEAKER_01]: was cannabis, that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado went way heavy on the taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of places went worse, but.
[SPEAKER_02]: What keeps the black market thriving when
you over tax it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It keeps the free market, the free market.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no taxes there.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my questions was, and I know this
isn't going to happen, like you don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is still up in the air, but what do
you think this will do for legal,
[SPEAKER_02]: for medical and recreational lead?
[SPEAKER_02]: Huge leaps forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will there still be two different markets
or do you think it all just become weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll end up evening out.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I really, really look
forward to is there are a bunch of people
[SPEAKER_01]: in my life that are like 65 plus,
and only a few of them were cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: friendly in their youth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them, it was literally a blockade
to financial stability for a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they just chose to not to pretend
like it didn't exist from the time they
[SPEAKER_01]: were 19 until they were in their 60s and
70s and a doctor brought it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so federal legalization is going to
lead to clinical trials that lead to them
[SPEAKER_01]: getting far superior medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that might just mean go get a gummy
that's five milligrams THC, 50 milligrams
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It might not be go get Prozac or whatever
the cannabis drug name ends up being.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marinol is the terrible one now,
but that's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that aspect of the medical market
is definitely going to stick around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it will be half separated
like it always has been here in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_01]: where you have to get a med card to shop
in this particular market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the production and distribution
pieces will blend completely together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having them separate here is just silly
and annoying.
[SPEAKER_02]: The excuse was to make sure that the
patients got their medicine and that the
[SPEAKER_02]: rest was available for recreational users
that they were always taken care of.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made a lot of sense and it's not like
we're casting a magic spell and just
[SPEAKER_01]: starting from where we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: First we had full prohibition and then we
were medical with no rules for a long time
[SPEAKER_01]: and now we're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had to respect that that process
happened as it advanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so keeping the two markets separate
made a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's legal in all 50 states to some
degree, having it separated like we do
[SPEAKER_01]: here in Colorado doesn't make a lot of
sense, especially when a lot of the rules
[SPEAKER_01]: here in Colorado get re-examined.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because right now their rules are wildly
different and that's why there's still a
[SPEAKER_01]: medical market at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, way different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't it weird?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm currently without a medical cannabis
card.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been so busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I was just gonna say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely haven't been able to get to a
doctor's appointment like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can get in stores you can't get into
just because I've got this little,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not even a paper now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fucking PDF on my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing with a lot of edibles
and I have to eat a larger physical
[SPEAKER_01]: quantity of the products to get the dosage
I need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can medically.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just silly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that hundred milligram limit at the
rec stores and eight grams of concentrates
[SPEAKER_02]: is the limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can get four edibles and four grams
or eight concentrates or eight edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's all I can want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know a lot of people are going,
well, dude, that's a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but what if I just want to go once a
week?
[SPEAKER_02]: Then that's my weekly allowance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if anybody comes over and you
come dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: The limits at all I think are going away
because the limits aren't there for any
[SPEAKER_01]: logical reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it's cannabis is legal in all 50
states and available in all 50 states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the limits meant to keeping you from
buying a hundred of everything and taking
[SPEAKER_01]: them to Arkansas and selling them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's already stores in Arkansas that
have the same shit on the shelf for
[SPEAKER_01]: roughly the same price, that's not a job
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the rules that make that job harder
can all go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like them to keep some of the rules
because a lot of them are good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the robbery data,
at least this was true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably still true because the
reasons it was true before made a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just haven't checked in like the last
year and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: But cannabis businesses get robbed way
less than like banks, gas stations,
[SPEAKER_01]: liquor stores, JCPenney's.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's because part of legalization was
you have to put cameras everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: There have to be cameras everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you pull up to the store,
it's like smile, you're on high def
[SPEAKER_01]: camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we've been able to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can look.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if somebody is in the parking lot
smoking in the dispensary parking lot,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're smoking a cigarette.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can zoom in and see if it's a cigarette
or a joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're able to look very closely from just
inside the store just by zooming in to see
[SPEAKER_02]: what you're smoking out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So be careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get yourself or us in trouble,
please.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's like that rule is annoying.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a prospective business owner,
because the infrastructure for that kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of system is pricey and it's an added cost
to a new business.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from the security standpoint and from
a it really helped us push legalization
[SPEAKER_01]: forward because Colorado and Washington
did shit like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We kept the robbery numbers down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's seed to sale and all the
cameras.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a security guard, an armed
security guard in most dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the pieces matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of the necessary for the
armed security guard is going to go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of the reason cannabis costs so much
is because it's not legal everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the prohibition markup is massive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that it's not illegal, there's no
reason for it to be expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tomatoes aren't expensive because we could
just have them grow them, toss them at
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, just like everything else,
there's a price that all the steak we can
[SPEAKER_01]: produce gets sold at because it's
reasonable and saving with cars and shoes
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the same thing with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be a price fluctuation
that's wild for a while, and then it'll
[SPEAKER_01]: settle out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that'll be the people that produce
cannabis produce this much and the people
[SPEAKER_01]: that consume consume this much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is how much money changes hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of people are going to
be happy as shit with that system.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of existing I never thought
we would get here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of blown away that the last
couple of months have played out like they
[SPEAKER_01]: have.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exciting, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been an exciting time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The past, just everything going on has
been exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think we'll see a decline in sales?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was surprised this came up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think we'll see a decline in sales
in legal states because the other states
[SPEAKER_02]: will have it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're not going to sell as much
because Texas will be coming to get it and
[SPEAKER_02]: Missouri won't be coming to get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're already legal now.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them aren't going to produce it,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of like everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a place that grows oranges and a
place that grows pineapple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And places that are known for wine and
Colorado and Oregon, Washington,
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've already got a foothold and like good
luck fucking finding and affording grow
[SPEAKER_01]: space in Manhattan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for a really reasonable price,
I can ship container loads of cannabis to
[SPEAKER_01]: Manhattan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I bet my shipping price is lower than
your gross cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's going to be true in a
lot of places.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of cannabis is headed
outdoors, and I'm really excited about
[SPEAKER_01]: that because one of the downsides to
legalization was we finally got to see the
[SPEAKER_01]: power consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when everybody moved into giant
warehouses in Denver, they had been very
[SPEAKER_01]: closely monitoring their power consumption
on a couple of green energy initiatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when legalization hit, and the
building boom took place, those numbers
[SPEAKER_01]: skyrocketed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was funny because nobody understood
what was happening for a minute because
[SPEAKER_01]: nobody really believed the cannabis market
was that big.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny, the DEA has been telling
people about it every year since we were
[SPEAKER_01]: teenagers, but no one listened or no one
really understood the numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you say stuff like 40 billion,
it's so big people can't comprehend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they just sort of nod along.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the number gets that big.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you really do the math and think
about it, it gets astronomical quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many transformers in Colorado blew up
the next two years, dude?
[SPEAKER_02]: How many blew up behind a cultivation that
we managed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, excuse me, I'm burping.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to dab burp.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just common for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado had to really increase its
infrastructure and improve our electrical
[SPEAKER_01]: grid because of all the extra demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm kind of excited to see a lot of
that move outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of that move to greenhouses,
hoop houses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Being around all of that electricity,
I think I can feel it when I walk toward
[SPEAKER_02]: the grow buildings that have 100,
250, 500 lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's 250,000 watts of flowering
lights in there plus what fucking 30,
[SPEAKER_02]: 60, 90, 120 tons of fucking cooling on the
roof, plus all the fans, plus all the
[SPEAKER_02]: moving fucking watering pumps and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot you can feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to be able to feel the plant energy
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you walk in there, you don't feel
that at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You feel transformers and three phase
power.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all you feel is hum.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bigger, the bigger the grow gets,
like outside cannabis is a cleaner.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes bad shit out of the air and soil
and gives us back an awesome flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: But inside, you're totally killing that
benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just one of the downsides.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also think indoor herb tends to be a lot
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to say we do five point seven
crops and there's no bird shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't get hail, rain, snow,
sleet, bird shit, deer shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we didn't get all that random shit
on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But John made the sun, so the sun is on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're all trying to mimic the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just trying to rebuild everything
inside that's already outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: You hang a light and now you got to cool
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to change where it's
grown, how it's grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's major shockwaves that will go
through the industry with federal
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: The shockwaves that I'm thinking about
didn't happen so much in Canada because
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada's frozen a lot of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so their outdoor growth season is
specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's short.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indoor is definitely the way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in the States, that's not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a shit ton of farmland that is
wrongly purposed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to mention, cannabis is a very
profitable crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm guessing there'll be a lot of
farmers that don't have any business
[SPEAKER_01]: getting into the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like there were here with business
owners that bought in without taking the
[SPEAKER_01]: time to hire people that knew what they
were doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we saw the hemp industry ruin people's
lives the past couple of years doing the
[SPEAKER_02]: same game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: They forget that you have to cultivate a
distribution market for hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're already wearing all the hemp shirts
we want, not to be a dick about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we need more products for the hemp
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with cannabis, that market is already
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The demand is already there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the demand is growing, especially as
more medical uses get distributed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And more people get discovered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And more people get told, hey,
go try this for your ailments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the stigma goes away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And more people are not as afraid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're ready to do it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're finding that as an alternative
to the other medicines we talked about
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have to take the chemo
medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're other medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one medicine that makes them shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other medicine that makes them not
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that makes them pee.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other one that makes them not
leak.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe stop taking one or three of
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: It cracks me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: My whole family knows that this is where
I've chosen.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the hill I chose to die on a long
time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for a while, they chuckled.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they were just like, aw.
[SPEAKER_01]: He could have been a banker and been super
rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead, he did this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he seems happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, one by one, they're shooting me
messages like, so I've got this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my doctor was like, try some medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what he meant by that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said SAV.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's a SAV?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or strand is what they used to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I chuckled because it's happened to a
half dozen of them now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that market is exploding.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the marijuana use went way
up in Colorado type articles, when you get
[SPEAKER_01]: into the numbers, it's the over 55 crowd
that just retired from a job that's
[SPEAKER_01]: randomly drug test or threatened to for 30
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then their doctor said, oh yeah,
that ailment sounds miserable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you go smoke weed about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the symptoms will go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they tried it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they're in love with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the big increases are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when that gets combined with
outdoor growing and all 50 states coming
[SPEAKER_01]: online, the last of them coming online
kind of at the same time, those shockwaves
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to ripple for a while,
y'all.
[SPEAKER_02]: A while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the little old lady that just
discovered cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's like a cute old lady.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's like, my doctor showed me how to
smoke weed or told me to smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I bought some.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I was a bud tender and worked at
the dispensary, those are my favorites.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're so enthusiastic about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're kind of secretive about it
because they don't want their nephews and
[SPEAKER_02]: uncles to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But their fucking nephews and uncles shop
at the same dispensary that they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're all trying to like make sure
nobody knows and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just, I loved those little old
ladies that were so enthusiastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel so much better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I eat the edibles and I rub it on my
elbows and I give some to my dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to love those little old ladies,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were really one of my favorite
customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always loved showing them around the
sales floor and like, oh, you don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can eat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to eat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can rub it into your shoulder.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we have it in an ice cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was just fun to kind of take them
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I always my mind always goes back to
there was a documentary or I think it was
[SPEAKER_01]: a documentary where they followed around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might have been one of the Sanjay Gupta
specials, a couple of patients that were
[SPEAKER_01]: trying out medical cannabis for the first
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them was like this fifties or
sixties veteran, I think Navy vet,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he went to the dispensary and bought
like an eighth and bought a glass pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know where you're going and went home
and sat down on the couch and like just
[SPEAKER_01]: ripped a chunk off the top of the bud and
stuffed it in the pipe and then tried to
[SPEAKER_01]: light it from underneath and like to cook
it from underneath and kept burning his
[SPEAKER_01]: hand for three or four times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the whole time I'm watching this,
I'm fucking horrified because there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: way in hell that if that guy hasn't been
around cannabis that much for real,
[SPEAKER_01]: that the cameraman statistically,
if that guy was that clueless,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no way the cameraman was also that
clueless.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not statistically possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: The camera dude's not supposed to get
involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that dude was that's how you smoke
other drugs, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way that guy was lighting that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's been on other drugs before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, was kind of my guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you've been around something that
you consume that way, how the fuck do you
[SPEAKER_01]: not know how to hit a bowl of weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: How is that possible?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen that documentary and I laughed
at that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, that guy does other drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: His fourth hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gets it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my guess was that they show the
lighting of the pipe from underneath and a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of anti drug images.
[SPEAKER_01]: But oh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When older people would come in,
I would always sort of like, so what's
[SPEAKER_01]: your familiar familiarity level with the
plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, please tell me so that I know who
I'm dealing with and I can appropriately
[SPEAKER_01]: educate you so that you don't hurt
yourself or someone else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, don't burn your hand or eat two
chocolate bars and get behind them.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or try to just do anything after two of
those chocolate bars.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Mike, I do need to start
wrapping up the show here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been going for close to an hour,
but I've got one more question on my list
[SPEAKER_02]: of federal legalization topics here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Write your senators, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, please do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Write your senators.
[SPEAKER_02]: Write them again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Write them again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Write them once a month, maybe once every
two weeks and let them know that you do
[SPEAKER_02]: support the federal legalization of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be professional.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't curse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't use profanity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kindly just politely let them know,
hey, my name is Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that we should work towards
federal cannabis legalization.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Mike, my question for you is,
if we do have federal legalization of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, does that mean, bro,
that we get to have cannabis events again?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if it's legal, like beer,
does that mean since we've got beer at the
[SPEAKER_02]: fair and there's bars on every corner?
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man, come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want you to tell me, yes,
that one of these days we can go smoke at
[SPEAKER_02]: a place with friends again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want it so bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just having hopes and dreams.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado, before the pandemic,
was in the process of discussing rules and
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations for consumption clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And had just started issuing licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then everybody just hit a big red stop
on all of that because it doesn't make
[SPEAKER_01]: sense to be licensing businesses where you
can go consume cannabis with your friends
[SPEAKER_01]: if you can't go to businesses or be with
your friends.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sucks because they hit pause.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it made sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's other shit on their plate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way small businesses are right
now, can you imagine just paying rent
[SPEAKER_01]: until this is over for a business that
hasn't even had a chance to open yet and
[SPEAKER_01]: won't until this is totally over?
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be closed by now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be bankrupt.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And apparently landlords still really want
their money for retail space, which is why
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody's closing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm desperate for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want cannabis cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want Cushcons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want Indo Expos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want cannabis sections at county fairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want, I mean, everything short of sign
spinners.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want it all.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like we have a bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reason we couldn't have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like we have a bar where we can go
see some shitty classic rock band on the
[SPEAKER_02]: weekend right across the street and go
listen to somebody play fucking Mustang
[SPEAKER_02]: Sally and Born to Be Wild and drink
fucking liquor until we get fucking,
[SPEAKER_02]: until we fucking puke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why can't we go somewhere right across the
street and sit at a booth and fucking take
[SPEAKER_02]: a few dabs and listen to some Bob Marley
and some fish?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I think we should all be able to
have a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it have to be fish?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll let you play some 311 on the
jukebox too, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just give me a cannabis friendly space
outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me, put up a roof deck.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they kept talking about in
Denver because apparently, I don't know if
[SPEAKER_01]: the listeners are aware, but if you see
somebody smoking a joint, I guess it makes
[SPEAKER_01]: you high too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, but they seem really worried
that people driving by would see people
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were talking about doing
consumption at venues, open air on roof
[SPEAKER_01]: decks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kept saying roof decks, which seems
sort of nuts to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, do you really want stoned people
three, fours up fenced in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like maybe think shit through and just let
us be in the parking lot for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But hopefully some of that, the nonsense
goes away with federal legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my big hope, especially in places
like Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I was in Arkansas, I would just be
tits up happy that this was happening at
[SPEAKER_01]: all because otherwise it probably wasn't
going to happen in your neck of the woods
[SPEAKER_01]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if everybody else gets to why not us
too, is going to be the same to me and
[SPEAKER_01]: even the very last state to legalize.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it right down the street.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why can't we get it here?
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had I prepared for this show more,
I would have a list of all the places that
[SPEAKER_01]: are talking about legalization in one form
or another, but it's a long list right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much everybody that's not in on it
yet is talking about it in a major way.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last two elections were shakeups and
they shook up towards legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep shaking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope we get federal legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would help a lot of things for a lot
of people and it'd make things a lot more
[SPEAKER_02]: fun than when the vid is gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be really funny if Biden has
to sign that law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it'll be really funny if President
Biden has to sign that law for a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care who signs it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope he does.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope he has to sign it real soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the sooner the better.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Mike, let's start wrapping this
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do need to get some liquid on the throat
here and start wrapping up the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it, buddy.

[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me back on,
but hopefully we get to do this much more
[SPEAKER_01]: often.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude, this is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your background looks good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your mic sounded beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had a lot of stuff to say tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have to say much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just sat back and let you go some of my
favorite shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your major upgrades happened to my
recording space while I was away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Electrical improvements, gear was
purchased.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I'm real comfortable right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's do this more often.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every we'll do this every Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish we could do this once a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on your schedule.
[SPEAKER_02]: You say when?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be so happy if my life was in a
place where I could meet to like a regular
[SPEAKER_01]: weeknight of event anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be fucking fantastic.

[SPEAKER_02]: That's my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can guarantee.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed like it was going to be that
type of night tonight because I committed
[SPEAKER_01]: to try to do this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I ducked the punch, I think.
