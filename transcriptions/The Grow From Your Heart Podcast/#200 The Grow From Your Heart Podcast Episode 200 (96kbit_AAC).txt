[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode number 200 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_01]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist, or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_01]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this my friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, any decision I send a huge
thank you shout out to my friends in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Mystic Roots band for letting me use their
music on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Kat Kuth and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy 420 everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode is coming out on 420 April
20th of 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for joining me for 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be a work on 420 at 420,
but I guarantee you we will be taking a
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke break.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or wait, maybe we won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depends on who you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're the boss, we're not taking a
smoke break.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're the MED, if you're OSHA,
we will be in the building working for
[SPEAKER_01]: 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a podcast fan, we'll be dabbing
the fuck out for 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be a good ass time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, happy 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't tell, I'm already high as
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is 419.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm recording the day before 420,
obviously Wednesday, 419.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been smoking some Grateful Dog
Shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had some Golden Goat Shatter in my hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a joint the size of a small
baseball bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: This thing is going to get several people
stoned out of their minds that this should
[SPEAKER_01]: be a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whenever this gets lit up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for joining me for episode 200.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great lineup, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode number 200 on 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, we've been recording this
podcast for what I believe has been
[SPEAKER_01]: approximately two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great celebration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for listening, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for being here for 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're smoking on something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take some time to roll up a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Roll up a blunt, if that's what you got to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really a big fan of blunts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we grow really quality cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then to watch you guys grind it up and
put it into a blunt is kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: heartbreaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: That blunt tastes like shit to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your grape-flavored blunt wrap.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the fuck is with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those berry-flavored blunt wraps that you
guys are smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes my lips feel funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot deal with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how you guys do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're smoking a blunt,
more power to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke that blunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just not for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, I know, people are going to
say, but you run butane over your weed and
[SPEAKER_01]: destroy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turns it into Golden Sweet Shatter that
doesn't taste like funky, like I'm smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: incense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke a blunt with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke some shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke some live resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke some rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you got, smoke it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got some sauce?
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a dab and pass a dab over to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love a dab of that shit right about
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, I am Rambly.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be a short, quick
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to jump in and take some
dabs and hang out with everybody for 420
[SPEAKER_01]: so that we could feel like we spent some
time together on the National Stoner
[SPEAKER_01]: Holiday, since this is a cannabis-based
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since I'm doing shout-outs and stuff,
let me start off with something really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really serious here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge thanks to everybody who has
contributed and supported me on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recently, I had a couple of sizable
contributions that really helped me move
[SPEAKER_01]: my project forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps with all the new equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll notice that there is a video for
this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't be up for a long time,
but I am recording a video of this right
[SPEAKER_01]: now onto the iPad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm running the recording gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran a headphone out into a device called
the iRig 2.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm running iRig into the iPad.
[SPEAKER_01]: The iPad is recording a video that will
have this microphone quality sound coming
[SPEAKER_01]: through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the future, there will be video of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to get all the videos up on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a lot of work, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, thanks to the people who have
contributed on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not aware of Patreon,
let me tell you what Patreon is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patreon is a service that allows my
listeners to contribute financially to the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to learn more, you can go to
patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the information that you need will be
right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can sign up, you can create an
account, and then you can contribute.
[SPEAKER_01]: What will happen is you can sign up to
contribute one time, or you can sign up
[SPEAKER_01]: for a subscription.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you sign up for a one-time
contribution, whatever amount you decide
[SPEAKER_01]: to type in, if it's $1, if it's $9,
if it's $9,999, if you sign up for a
[SPEAKER_01]: one-time contribution on the first of the
month, that one-time contribution will
[SPEAKER_01]: roll through, and that will be deposited
into my PayPal account.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you decide to do a subscription every
month, whatever amount you decided to
[SPEAKER_01]: contribute, that will be rolled from your
card into my PayPal account once a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not trying to get rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not asking you guys to pay my rent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not asking to buy me a new car.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm trying to do is offset the cost
of my website.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does cost me a little bit of money to
have a website, which is where I host the
[SPEAKER_01]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, you guys, my website sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not a web guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't put any time or energy or effort
into that website.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nothing impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm embarrassed, but I don't have the
resources, or I don't know how to do that,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm not going to take the time to
learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll get fixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy that does it's been tied up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a new dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll get to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, the website hosts the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: The podcast is then dumped into all of the
other services, like iTunes, Stitcher,
[SPEAKER_01]: PodBay, FeedBurner, wherever else it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes to a lot of places so people can
listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does cost money to have the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: The funds that you guys contribute to my
Patreon go directly to my PayPal,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then that goes directly to my web
hosting, and it covers the cost of my web
[SPEAKER_01]: hosting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once the web hosting is covered,
what I will do with the funds ... I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: making sure I didn't press a button here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just moved my iPad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still recording.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I plan to do with those funds is
cover things like this iPad that I bought,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then also it will cover more toys for
the iPads.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to add some accessories to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be upgrades.
[SPEAKER_01]: I buy these little foam covers for the
microphones.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be part of what the Patreon
covers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you'd like to contribute,
or if you'd like to know more,
[SPEAKER_01]: simply go to patreon.com slash grow from
your heart, and all the information will
[SPEAKER_01]: be right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you, everybody that contributed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it was $1, if it was more than that,
thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if you did not contribute,
if you're listening to this podcast right
[SPEAKER_01]: now, if you're hearing my voice,
thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do not have to contribute financially
for me to appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your listens mean the world to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just being part of my community,
being part of my team here, being involved
[SPEAKER_01]: in this, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to give me money for me to
be your friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like you for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like you for who you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look good today, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has anyone told you that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You look fucking great today.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who can tell I'm high as giraffe pussy?
[SPEAKER_01]: I am, I'll admit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been talking about the Dude Grows
Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my friends at the Dude
Grows show, the dude and Scotty Real,
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole crew, the Dude Grows crew,
a bunch of great folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am honored to be a part of that little
crew there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to the Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not tell you guys who the winners
were, because I left before that happened,
[SPEAKER_01]: honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was exhausted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to work the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to drive 130 miles back home.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, on the next episode of the Dude
Grows that I listened to, they announced
[SPEAKER_01]: the winners.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was excited, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna go through, these are just the
flower winners is all I've got here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not list the concentrate winners,
but here are the flower winners from the
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude Grows Cup that happened on April 15th
of 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know when you're listening to
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully on 420 with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dabs up if you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here are the winners from the Dude
Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Third place for best flower, voted by the
attendees of the event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Third place, Lemon Jeffrey from IRE
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not enter it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, a guy named Cole, who is a
well-known grower in Denver that grows for
[SPEAKER_01]: a large dispensary, a well-known large
dispensary in Denver, a guy named Cole
[SPEAKER_01]: grew some Lemon Jeffrey, and he entered it
into the Dude Grows Cup, and it won third
[SPEAKER_01]: place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congrats, shout out, and much love to
Cole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Cole, if you're listening to this,
or if anybody can reach out to Cole,
[SPEAKER_01]: and have him contact me, and don't just go
trollin' and act like you're Cole,
[SPEAKER_01]: but Cole, I've got a present for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you gotta do is get in touch with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to put some things in your hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, great work, congratulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, man, I've got a gift for you,
so please do get in touch.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the Dude Grows crew can put him in
touch with me somehow, I would appreciate
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, big shout out to the Dude Grows
crew for the relationship that we've
[SPEAKER_01]: built.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's really cool that we've got
two podcasts serving two different
[SPEAKER_01]: audiences and one joined audience,
and there's no, I don't feel intimidated
[SPEAKER_01]: by them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not intimidated by me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fuckin' awesome that we've built this
community and this connection and this
[SPEAKER_01]: bond.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get back on track, because I'm high
as shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second place in the Dude Grows Cup was
Purple Elephant, grown by a guy who calls
[SPEAKER_01]: himself StonyJack420.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to StonyJack420 with the
Purple Elephant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said that the difference in second
and third place was actually one vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were 35 and 34 votes for second and
third place, so one vote split it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you go to a cannabis event and you
were able to vote, just like in politics,
[SPEAKER_01]: fuckin' vote, because your vote counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might not have a third place winning
strain if you would have voted
[SPEAKER_01]: differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one vote is all it would have taken to
knock me out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not me personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bred the strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't take too much credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once those seeds left, I don't know what
happened to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, coal grew the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: First place got over 50 votes that it was
everybody's favorite strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: First place was a strain called
Brandywine, grown by a person who calls
[SPEAKER_01]: himself Van Ripster.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not met Van Ripster.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I hope to one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much respect for winning the Dude Grows
Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: So third place, Lemon Jeffery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second place, Purple Elephant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And first place, Brandywine, grown by Van
Ripster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent work to everybody at the Dude
Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a great event.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys get ready, because I'm going to
enter some shit next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I drove up there and I had a good time and
I partied.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why in the fuck didn't I enter something?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have a cup sitting on this table right
now, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So dude, Scotty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get ready, because I'm entering next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stoney Jack, get ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: Van Ripster, get ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cole, talk to me and get ready,
because I'm coming for you next year,
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be in this damn Dude Grows
Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reason for me to drive up there
and hang out with everybody and not bring
[SPEAKER_01]: some cannabis to enter, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know what was missing from the Dude
Grows Cup?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bo, you've got to be up here next year
with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all that was missing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Bo Nellis, I look forward to seeing you
at the Dude Grows Cup next year with the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be a great podcast experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got one question for you that I want
to ask everybody that's listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might have two or three questions once I
start rambling.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know how it goes with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to keep this episode short,
but yeah, that might not happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know what you're listening to
when you're smoking down.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of music do you like to jam?
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, I like reggae music.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like Morgan Heritage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like Steel Pulse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like Marlon Asher.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I'm a huge Grateful Dead fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like any of the Grateful Dead stuff,
all of the Grateful Dead stuff mostly,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I like stuff from like 1977.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of my favorite if you're a
Deadhead.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Betty Boards from May of 77.
[SPEAKER_01]: The North East Coast Tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's some of my favorite shit ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: 72 is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of that acoustic stuff from 72.
[SPEAKER_01]: The West Coast stuff from the early years
is great, but the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, you guys aren't fucking
Grateful Dead fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: 72, 74, 77.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my favorite Grateful Dead shit
right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I think if somebody asked me what
my favorite band was, I would probably
[SPEAKER_01]: have to flip a coin that day and see what
kind of mood I'm in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's either Fish or the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a huge Fish fan also.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I'm getting blazed, I like to
listen to Fish, the Grateful Dead,
[SPEAKER_01]: or good reggae.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, when I was younger,
I was a huge metalhead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked the not super heavy metalhead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, I dabbled into the super heavy
shit for a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was into like Metallica,
Pantera, Megadeth, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of into the Pearl Jam side of stuff,
but more on the metal, less grungy side,
[SPEAKER_01]: the more metal-y side of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So occasionally when we're working at The
Grow and things are dragging, yesterday
[SPEAKER_01]: morning, everybody had a hard time getting
fucking started.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I fired up Metallica Radio and just the
kick drum and cymbals and snare drum
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody was working at an acceptable
pace after a couple of songs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I like to listen to if I
need to get it fired up, which isn't very
[SPEAKER_01]: often.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I really need to get moving,
I'll put on Moe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Moe was like super high energy,
maybe some government mule if I need to
[SPEAKER_01]: wake the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really rambled about music.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish, Moe, the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reggae music, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Widespread panic occasionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to listen to a lot of panic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just nostalgic to me, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always some good Jerry Garcia stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always some of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to know what you guys are
listening to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me a tweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to tweet me, it's at
GFYHpodcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to email me, of course,
it's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know what music you're listening
to when you're getting blazed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, just because it's fun to know what
people are doing, what are your favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: snacks after you get high?
[SPEAKER_01]: After you take a couple of fat dabs and
your mouth starts doing that and then your
[SPEAKER_01]: stomach goes rawr.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the kind of shit you want to walk
to the fridge for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or what do you want to drive to 7-Eleven
and get?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know what kind of snacks you
like to get down on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like cold Dr. Pepper in a bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fresh cold Dr. Pepper in a bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want it to go pshh when I crack it open.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like my favorite shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And any kind of snacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer crunchy over sweet, I think,
most of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the time, but not always.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's just my snack preferences.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know what you're snacking on once
you get blazed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to know what you're listening
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know what you're snacking on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be friends with you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, tell me what you're smoking on for
$4.20, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's $4.20.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tweet me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know what you're smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Email me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know what you're smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know what strain you're smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know how you're smoking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have dabs?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got live resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you care to let me know, if you're not
in an illegal state, let me know where you
[SPEAKER_01]: purchased it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got it at a dispensary,
let me know which dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me know what you think of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, that's a fun thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could be like, I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like right now, as soon as I start playing
the music to fade out the podcast,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a dab of Grateful Dog
Shatter through a Hitman rig with a quartz
[SPEAKER_01]: nail on it, a quartz banger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the flowers were grown by me and the
product was extracted by our friend,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Barefoot Extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also may take care.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is better because this came from a
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may dab some lemon Jeffrey batter from
Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's who extracted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I purchased it at a place called
Elevate in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Elevated, sorry, Elevated in Colorado
Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So give me that kind of info.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to, let me know what you're
smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, it's
growfromyourheartathotmail.com or you can
[SPEAKER_01]: tweet me at GFYHpodcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you're on the Facebook, just go to
the Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, it's grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know what you're smoking on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know what you're listening to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then let me know what you're going to
snack on after you get nice and blazed for
[SPEAKER_01]: 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I've been rambling for like 15
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually stop and take a drink and take a
couple of dabs right about now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think I'm just going to wish
everybody a happy 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am going to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am going to take a couple of dabs while
the music plays and I hope you are dabbing
[SPEAKER_01]: with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would take a fat dab right now while
we're recording, but I'm just going to
[SPEAKER_01]: cough and it's just going to be kind of a
waste of recording space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So know that when I hit play on the ending
music that I'm taking fat dabs and that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's time for you to give your mom a hug.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't even thought about what song I'm
going to play at the end here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're going to play Ganja Farmer
by Marlon Asher.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like a very appropriate song and
I bet I could find it on my phone pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly to make it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am recording a video also.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to record the video.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably will not record the audio
unless I fuck up right now trying to find
[SPEAKER_01]: this song which I'm searching for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just bear with me for just a couple of
seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me turn this down so I don't screw up
on you and make something go crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're typing in Ganja and it doesn't find
Ganja Farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really weird how that iPhone works
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, look what I found.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a song called Ganja Farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, ladies and gentlemen,
I want to thank everybody for listening to
[SPEAKER_01]: episode 200.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: 200 episodes, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I'm kind of cheating because I've
been putting out those long episodes,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's still some work to those two.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it counts, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are 200 episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's official.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for listening to 200
episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for tolerating me for what I think
has been about two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope everybody has a huge, safe,
exciting, stony as fuck 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope your eyes get super red.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope everybody makes it through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to an event to be an
activist, don't be stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go to jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't cause any problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be respectful of the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Represent this planet in a very
respectful, respectable way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are ambassadors to the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We represent this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Represent it in a good way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be a dipshit, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my serious note for this 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please, if you're out there, do it
responsibly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be on the news.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you're doing whatever you're
doing, picture the news story in your
[SPEAKER_01]: head.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going to go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dipshit drives car into wall, or dipshit,
it's not going to say dipshit on the
[SPEAKER_01]: headline, but that's how you're going to
feel when you read it and it's about you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dipshit does something dumb to put a black
eye on the marijuana scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be that guy, alright?
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you have a great 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a huge shout out to
everybody who is smoking with me today on
[SPEAKER_01]: 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to play some reggae music.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like a DJ when I do this,
but this song is from Marlon Asher and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's called Ganja Farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody has a happy 420 and until next
time, take a fat dab and give your mama a
[SPEAKER_01]: hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go.
