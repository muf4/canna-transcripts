[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for episode number 172 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_03]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_03]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_03]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_03]: for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_03]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: As always, I want to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_03]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to Kat, Koot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ladies and gentlemen, White Mike is back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the table, Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys want to follow Mike on
Twitter, that'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is at NemoPunk15 on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give him a follow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let him know that you learned about him
through the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also check out Mike's Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you check that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: He would appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been trying to remember that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of words.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of mouthfuls of words.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I put that name up there,
I had two or three people go like too many
[SPEAKER_04]: words.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, well, I needed him.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's as succinct as I could make it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's to the point.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've been listening to this show,
succinct isn't really my wheelhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I say that this show is the
Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cannabis news, education,
and conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you're looking for the Nike
Collector podcast, this obviously is the
[SPEAKER_03]: wrong shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to put it right out there,
right at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_04]: The intro is perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: It tells you exactly what you're about to
get.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's truth in advertising.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you didn't hear something that sounds
good in that intro, you might want to find
[SPEAKER_04]: another show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're looking for fun with boats or
fun with maps, this might not be the show
[SPEAKER_03]: for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: The look on your face is priceless,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: None of the examples for shows that went
through my head were so family-friendly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to be friendly-friendly here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you support Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm trying to do is get people
to follow Mike here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nemopunk15 on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, I would love it if you'd follow
me on, let's see, we'll start off with on
[SPEAKER_03]: Twitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said Instagram a second ago,
but Mike's on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Follow me on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Follow me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you guys, I have got nearly 11,000
followers on Instagram, so check me out
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Iri, underscore, genetics,
I-R-I-E, underscore, genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Iri is a Jamaican word.
[SPEAKER_03]: It means to feel as blessed as you could
feel.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know that feeling?
[SPEAKER_03]: I describe it as like, you're sitting
under a tree and the weather is just
[SPEAKER_03]: right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of sunny, but there's a little
bit of breeze and that grass is nice and
[SPEAKER_03]: cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And either your significant other or your
best friend or your dog is sitting right
[SPEAKER_03]: next to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you don't got to worry in the fucking
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is just right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're feeling Iri.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Iri, Iri genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just feeling good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the most pleasing, comfortable
feeling you could get.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just feeling all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything be Iri.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Iri genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, follow me there on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: I post a whole bunch of great cannabis
photography.
[SPEAKER_03]: I post pictures of myself with famous
comedians.
[SPEAKER_03]: I post pictures of male plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a lot of weed growers and breeders are
posting pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're males.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put pictures of King Solomon up there
all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be a good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I think I covered all of the social
media outlets.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, if you want to contact me,
there you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can hit me up at
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got questions or comments or
concerns, I'd love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll answer all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll handle it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike, you got a shitty grin on your face,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on over there?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just there's so much now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just had a little flashback.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, how do you get a hold of me?
[SPEAKER_04]: And you had two options.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to give them your address?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or your phone number?
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's like, well, I have 36
different ways you can get a hold of me on
[SPEAKER_04]: social media.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the old school ways don't matter
anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now there's no way of ducking anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they can see that you tweeted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why didn't you call me back?
[SPEAKER_03]: I see you tweeting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see you up on Snapchat showing that
you're at the mall.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you call me back?
[SPEAKER_04]: You might be in a meeting, but if you can
tweet from the meeting, you can text me
[SPEAKER_04]: back from the meeting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I do have a lot of contact
information.
[SPEAKER_04]: It shows you this message was seen at
2.45.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's 4.45 now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why haven't I heard back?
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a question, motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't duck anybody now.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Social media has got us on lock.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to be accountable.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're on a podcast, and if you're on
more than one podcast and you're out there
[SPEAKER_03]: like a lot of people are, you are
accountable for what you say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because people will point out that you've
made indiscrepancies.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you said this and this, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'd be like, god damn.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't a lie.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got the date wrong because I'm high.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first time it hit me, somebody came up
to me in public and was like, are you
[SPEAKER_04]: white, Mike?
[SPEAKER_04]: I turned around and was like, huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, wait, you recognize me
from across the store by my oh,
[SPEAKER_04]: fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I need to think before I speak a
little bit, a little bit more sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I was at One Love Garden Supply
one time talking to Burn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to Burn.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a normal shopper in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he paused and he looked at me and I
go, what's up, man?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he was like, obviously looked at
me and stopped like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, what, dude?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was cool about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, what's up, man?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, do you have a podcast?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, it's totally me, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, I recognized you by your
voice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, that's fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, there are people listening that
recognize us by our marvelous,
[SPEAKER_03]: sexy voices.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ran into someone last night actually
that recognized me from my city council
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff because that's broadcast on live TV.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she goes, I know you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, oh, from?
[SPEAKER_04]: And she goes, you were on TV at my
grandpa's house.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just started laughing because there's a
whole bunch of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: This segment of the senior citizens down
here in Pueblo that watch a lot of local
[SPEAKER_04]: government public access television.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of them really like me because I
go and give city council shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for a while I was doing it about a
whole bunch of issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I've got this weird geriatric fan
base that loves me.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's creepy.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I wasn't aware of it until I was
eating lunch one day and I had two senior
[SPEAKER_04]: citizens come up and be like, are you the
guy that goes to city council?
[SPEAKER_04]: You look like the guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever gotten, are you the guy on
the paper smoking weed?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you the guy in the news that was
smoking weed?
[SPEAKER_04]: Only from family.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm from Southern Colorado, not quite this
Southern, but I have family friends
[SPEAKER_04]: throughout the state.
[SPEAKER_04]: A bunch of people up in Monument,
oddly enough, and they see our city
[SPEAKER_04]: government stuff and they see a lot of our
press.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they would call further up North to
my parents.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know what your son's doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: My dad's like, he's in his thirties.
[SPEAKER_04]: What the fuck am I going to do about it?
[SPEAKER_04]: But then I would get the phone call from
my folks saying like, hey, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: so and so, yeah, she saw you on the news.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was that you were doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Dabbing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Mike and I, I happen to be the first
person to buy recreational cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_03]: County of Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we legalized the sale of recreational
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Photos of the line Jeff got to be first in
are still used all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And national press stories about
legalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's two photos that were taken that
day in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're both aerial shots.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Jeff is shopping while that photo was
being taken.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm first.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm in there buying this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But those are, I mean, this has been years
now and that's, I saw it on NBC like a
[SPEAKER_04]: week ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where I'm headed is, I was first.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I've, I've got a picture of myself
actually purchasing cannabis, like the
[SPEAKER_03]: money transaction I'm handing him money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the owner of the dispensary is a
good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I shook his hand, like, thanks,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad that I could be your first
customer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm proud of you for having this fucking
landmark or milestone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I shook his hand, told him, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I turned around to my other friends at
work then I said, thanks guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I grabbed my stuff and I left.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I walked outside, I was
interviewed by eight news stations and
[SPEAKER_03]: documentary makers and documentarians,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there were a lot of cameras around me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm really glad that I'm a well-spoken
dude, because that would have been
[SPEAKER_03]: overwhelming for the fucking most normal
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of that footage, so also that
day there was a newscaster there who I
[SPEAKER_03]: ended up making friends with and she was
like, Hey, we're looking for, they
[SPEAKER_03]: actually asked me if I could smoke there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, can you roll a joint?
[SPEAKER_03]: She didn't know what to call it.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like, can you roll a cigarette and
smoke it here with your friends so that we
[SPEAKER_03]: can film that?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, actually that's highly
illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't smoke in front of my friend's
facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we put a little plan together and I
was like, let's go to my house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's all meet at my house at one o
'clock and smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I drove here with Mike joined me
and our friend Wade came and we came here
[SPEAKER_03]: and kind of put, we did some prop placing,
we put some product placement happened and
[SPEAKER_03]: there were a couple of packs of
i-regenetic seeds on the table.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had fun with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We set up some really nice shots for them
to get in.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't think about the optics of it
necessarily from people who aren't from,
[SPEAKER_04]: cause we were used to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were used to dabbing by them.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were used to the equipment that goes
with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The parts, the process, the people that
came over to interview us and see this
[SPEAKER_04]: little session, none of them were familiar
with this at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was a cameraman, there was a news
reporter who was from the TV news.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there was a newspaper writer and
the newspaper writer hinted, mentioned,
[SPEAKER_03]: talked about Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was saying without saying,
I'd love to fucking smoke that bowl with
[SPEAKER_03]: you guys, but all these assholes right
here would snitch on me is what she was
[SPEAKER_03]: saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we did our best to completely hotbox
basically a suburban home.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it didn't take much with three grown
men here.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the 20, 30 minutes they were here
filming and interviewing people.
[SPEAKER_04]: We nonstop had a dab rig and a bowl and a
joint going around the table.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that in one, in any given moment,
one of us was hitting everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that camera was going to touch
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was taking a dab, a big dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was worried about his, his lens at one
point, he got really, really close to now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, bro, that's like a couple
hundred degrees.
[SPEAKER_04]: You really don't want to get any closer.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that, that shot, that actual shot is
shown on the news so frequently.
[SPEAKER_03]: When they talk about marijuana,
they show me take a big dab and blow it
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, Oh, I feel relieved.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm sure that that is interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So luckily they don't use me taking a dab
nearly as frequently as they use you,
[SPEAKER_04]: but they still use that footage regularly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's been years now.
[SPEAKER_03]: That footage we saw, we agreed that that
footage can be used in anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like either ABC or NBC is what news
organization that was for.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's theirs now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's shown all over the nation when
they talk about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get messages from people all over
like, Hey, I just saw you on my news.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Task Rock actually sent me a gift because
his email was on the news.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, this guy right here got an
email on the news.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's hitting the email on the news.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he sent me a gift.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was pretty cool.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado affords us a lot of fun little
opportunities like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been on the news taking a dab in my
kitchen, my dining room at this table,
[SPEAKER_03]: at this dab table.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was the exact spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sitting now where I was sitting then.
[SPEAKER_03]: I of course am.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have this, I've got the Sheldon Cooper
OCD where this is my seat, but it's where
[SPEAKER_03]: the controls are.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd go nuts without it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, there's going to be a point to
this podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were 12 minutes in and I haven't even
told you what the topic is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Should we mention that the goal was very
little rambling for this show?
[SPEAKER_04]: 12 minutes of intro and rambles.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't even done the ad.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are wonderful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for supporting the
podcast and listen to our high asses
[SPEAKER_04]: ramble.
[SPEAKER_04]: We love you and we love you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that you love us.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know who else I love?
[SPEAKER_03]: I love my friends at Handmade Apparel.
[SPEAKER_03]: My friends at Handmade Apparel.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is so awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: They keep me stocked with dope ass
t-shirts and dope hoodies and dope hat
pins.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep me warm tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you Handmade.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're the second person I saw leaving
here now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grow From Your Heart podcast hoodie and
another person left here in a red Handmade
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparel hoodie with a big white logo on it
and it looks really good on her.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm at that age where I don't care what
your brand is.
[SPEAKER_04]: If your logo isn't hideous and it's a
really good quality item, I'm in.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I like about Handmade is it's
really, really high quality stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get you the best hoodies they can
start with.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're the Gildan.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's snuggly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's super cozy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when you put it on, you're like,
oh yeah, it was cozy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so snuggly and I'm a big dude and I
feel all cozy in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the printing quality that these
guys do.
[SPEAKER_03]: My logo of course is red, yellow,
green.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's white in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's black and then there's like a skin
tone and then there's whatever color they
[SPEAKER_03]: call that for my dreadlocks that they use.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are like nine colors in the color of
this design that they made for me and
[SPEAKER_03]: every single color pops.
[SPEAKER_03]: It all pops.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got your back bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike just freaked out because he turned to
look at the hoodies and I felt the
[SPEAKER_04]: headphone cord snag and then I heard the
rig move and that mini heart attack.
[SPEAKER_03]: I moved it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was watching out for my rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: I moved it for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no glass spillage here,
but these hoodies look wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, I'm not just trying to sell you
my hoodies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Handmade Apparel can make your hoodies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Handmade Apparel can make your t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Handmade, let me slow down and say this in
English you guys because I want to get
[SPEAKER_03]: this right for my friends because they do
a lot of good hard work for me and I owe
[SPEAKER_03]: them the proper ad.
[SPEAKER_03]: My friends at Handmade Apparel can make
your t-shirts and your hoodies and your
[SPEAKER_03]: stickers and your hat pins.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can help you with the artwork.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can get your stuff to you in a timely
manner.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're good people.
[SPEAKER_03]: They support the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're dab kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're my friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's no reason why you should not
shop with Handmade Apparel.
[SPEAKER_03]: All you've got to do, all you've got to,
fucking English is harder to you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to either take another dab or
something to figure this out.
[SPEAKER_03]: All you've got to do is go to
HandmadeApparel.biz and check them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell them that Rasta Jeff from the Girl
From Your Heart podcast sent you and they
[SPEAKER_03]: will hook you up with the best deal
possible to get your products printed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they've got a 25 piece minimum.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they'll charge you for 25 pieces plus a
small setup fee because they do have to
[SPEAKER_03]: make screens to sell.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if they're screens anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how that shit happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a printer, but they got to get you
set up.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do a really decent job at an amazing
level of quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: Decent.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do a damn good job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Way better than decent.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should be mad decent, yo.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they do a really good job.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love what they do.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've sent me stickers.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've sent me shirts.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've sent me, and it's not just my
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got shirts that they've printed for
other brands that they didn't know were
[SPEAKER_03]: coming to me that I got from those people
and all their stuff looks quality also.
[SPEAKER_03]: So much love, much respect to Handmade
Apparel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let them know that you're listening to the
Girl From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love supporting my friends in the
industry that are doing stuff for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're interested in one of these
hoodies, send me an email to
[SPEAKER_03]: growfromyourheart.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are very limited on quantity.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got 25 of them printed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a lot of friends that have been
on the show that have already picked them
[SPEAKER_03]: up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike's going to leave here today looking
stylish as fuck in his new Girl From Your
[SPEAKER_03]: Heart podcast hoodie.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got the Girl From Your Heart podcast
logo above the left breast.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just says Girl From Your Heart,
and it's got the little EQ bars in red,
[SPEAKER_03]: yellow, and green.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does not have my face.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, on the back, it's got the logo
very large, and it's got the original logo
[SPEAKER_03]: with my face and the EQ bars on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Handmade Apparel.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was Adam Hand that did it
himself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Adam Hand adjusted the art because
the art I sent him was a little pixely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was made by somebody else that's not a
super amazing graphic artist, but it was
[SPEAKER_03]: the right idea for what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Handmade Apparel took it and polished it
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks super dope.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks super slick, so they can handle
your artwork, everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: He thinks very open-mindedly, so if he
describes something to Adam, he can draw
[SPEAKER_03]: it without ruining your idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: He can put your idea into motion if you're
not an artist, which is really cool,
[SPEAKER_03]: because a lot of artists want to put their
idea into your idea and then put it on
[SPEAKER_03]: paper, and then there goes your idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, much love, mad respect to our
friends at Handmade Apparel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's tell everybody what this show is
going to be about, because I feel like
[SPEAKER_03]: we've been going on for a really long
time, and we haven't really- That's what
[SPEAKER_03]: life is going to be about tonight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today's show, there's some rule changes
that came down the pipe for Colorado
[SPEAKER_04]: concentrate companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I found this article on Leafly,
because it was the only place I could find
[SPEAKER_03]: it with this article after I did some
searching, and it said- These rule
[SPEAKER_04]: changes, they're not sexy, and so they
didn't make the press.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no other way to describe it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not something controversial.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not something that there was big
heated debate over, where anti-pop people
[SPEAKER_04]: and pro-pop people were fighting in the
courthouse or anything, so it didn't make
[SPEAKER_04]: the press a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was quiet.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's read the article.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is from Leafly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking for the author, Ben Alden,
and this was written on December 12th,
[SPEAKER_03]: 2016.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, this episode is coming out on
December 26th.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope everybody had a wonderful winter
holiday, whichever one that it is you
[SPEAKER_03]: celebrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going to be inclusive,
exclusive, racist, or biased, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: We love you all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever gender you have chosen to
identify as, whatever holiday you are
[SPEAKER_03]: accepting, I'm in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy holidays, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Article goes like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: On January 1st, 2017, Colorado will raise
its state-regulated limit on the residual
[SPEAKER_03]: levels of volatile solvents allowed in
cannabis concentrates.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little-noticed rule change that
involves dramatically increased levels of
[SPEAKER_03]: allowable solvents.
[SPEAKER_03]: Among the changes, and I'm going to read
off some of the changes they list here,
[SPEAKER_03]: the legal threshold for butane,
the solvent that puts the B and BHO,
[SPEAKER_03]: will increase more than six-fold,
from 800 parts per million to 5,000 parts
[SPEAKER_03]: per million.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I should slow down and explain
what that means.
[SPEAKER_03]: PPM means parts per million.
[SPEAKER_03]: That means that parts per million.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there are a million parts in there,
you are allowed to have 800 parts of
[SPEAKER_03]: butane in there before, out of a million,
which isn't a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably wouldn't notice that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I gave you a million something and told
you, pick me out 800 of them and give them
[SPEAKER_03]: to me, you wouldn't notice you're missing
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you're allowed to have 5,000,
which may start making a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_03]: difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may show that up.
[SPEAKER_03]: 5,000 PPMs of residual solvents of butane
feels like a whole lot of butane to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a larger number, but without
significantly more context.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not helpful information.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know for a fact that given the boiling
points, even really, really, really,
[SPEAKER_04]: really high amounts of butane left in
final product, all of that cooks off long
[SPEAKER_04]: before dab to face.
[SPEAKER_03]: It comes off at the nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're getting that much.
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's much of anything left over in
the product, it's gone on the nail long
[SPEAKER_04]: before the dab gets to you with butane.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it was harmful, they wouldn't be making
these changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we have enough information
yet to know how harmful smoking a
[SPEAKER_03]: concentrate made from butane could be.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a heavy BHO advocate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably smoke more BHO than 90% of the
world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the health rules that they haven't
been able to research specifically for
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis, they have already researched
specifically for similar items.
[SPEAKER_04]: True.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know a lot about pesticide residual
limits because of the tobacco industry,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's already something that's mass
produced that's smoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know PPM limits from some other things
like inhaled medicines.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me keep going to the article because
it mentions stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've pre-read.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did some research.
[SPEAKER_03]: This also, another rule, allowed residuals
for heptanes and other class of solvents
[SPEAKER_03]: will go up by a factor of 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: Xylenes, industrial solvents that
technically aren't allowed to be used for
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis extraction at all, will be
permitted at concentrations of up to 2,170
[SPEAKER_03]: particles per million, significantly
higher than the previous limit of one PPM.
[SPEAKER_03]: The state residual limit on benzene,
perhaps the most hazardous chemical of the
[SPEAKER_03]: group, will double from less than one PPM
to less than two PPMs.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a little article here that gives
you a graph that is way too small to read.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good example of how statistics
can sound scary.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to more than double from less
than one to almost two.
[SPEAKER_04]: To almost two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Depending on how dangerous those chemicals
are, that can make a difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's something I want to talk about
once we get done through the article.
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes on to say, On the surface,
these are staggering increases in
[SPEAKER_03]: chemicals that at some levels have been
associated with nausea, irregular
[SPEAKER_03]: heartbeat, increased risk of cancer,
and even death.
[SPEAKER_03]: Regulators, testing laboratory operators,
and industry members in other states have
[SPEAKER_03]: expressed surprises at the changes,
which will apply to both adult use and
[SPEAKER_03]: medical markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike Van Dyke, chief of the Environmental
Epidemiology, Occupational Health,
[SPEAKER_03]: and Toxicology branch at the Colorado
Department of Public Health and
[SPEAKER_03]: Environment, will recommend the new limit,
acknowledge that, which recommended the
[SPEAKER_03]: new limit, acknowledge that concentrates
capable of clearing the regulatory hurdles
[SPEAKER_03]: could be noticeably different from what's
currently allowed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Consumers are going to feel like they may
taste it, he said, of these new allowed
[SPEAKER_03]: butane levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: They might smell it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised nobody else has even
actually been interested in this,
[SPEAKER_03]: he told me in an interview just last week.
[SPEAKER_03]: The guys making these rules are saying
that we are going to taste and smell
[SPEAKER_03]: butane in our concentrates.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know enough about how much butane
that is to know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just when you break it down per million,
if that whole gram of hash is one million
[SPEAKER_04]: pieces, the 5,000 that you're talking
about aren't visible.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not visually identifiable as
separable from the whole.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about an incredibly small
amount here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does surprise me that this didn't make
the press because it does increase
[SPEAKER_04]: residual solvents.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no other way to say that to make
it sound better or worse, I don't think.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like something that would make
the press, but it was reported almost
[SPEAKER_04]: nowhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only reason I know about this rule
change is because of the labeling rules
[SPEAKER_04]: that came along with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: A friend of mine was negatively affected
by those rules, so I heard about them that
[SPEAKER_04]: way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, I heard about an incident.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes on to say, there are a few things
Colorado Department of Public Health and
[SPEAKER_03]: Environment's Van Dyke wants to make clear
about the new rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here is one.
[SPEAKER_03]: This change was not a result of any
industry pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: The increase didn't come at the behest.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that word mean, the behest?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what the word means.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never read that word before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they requested it or pushed for
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just didn't know if I said it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like it did.
[SPEAKER_03]: The increase did not come at the behest of
lobbyists, he told Leafley.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, in the work groups, if we heard
anything from the industry, I think we
[SPEAKER_03]: heard the other side that these were too
high.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, which is an uncommon place to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's going on?
[SPEAKER_03]: These numbers come from the International
Harmonized Guidelines for Residual
[SPEAKER_03]: Solvents and Pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Van Dyke is referring to a published
scientific article he cited in a July
[SPEAKER_03]: letter to Jim Birak, Director of the
Colorado Department of Revenue's
[SPEAKER_03]: Enforcement Division, which is in charge
of enforcing the new standards.
[SPEAKER_03]: Van Dyke provided the letter and spoke at
length to Leafley about the coming change.
[SPEAKER_03]: Will these numbers stand the test of time?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, he said.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're open to new data that comes out,
but our goal is to make sure that we
[SPEAKER_03]: maintain the best we can, the best
evidence-based regulations for health.
[SPEAKER_03]: The agency is trying to do precisely what
has been asked, Van Dyke said.
[SPEAKER_03]: Legislation passed this year, then it
lists the House Bill 16-1261, put the
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado Department of Public Health and
Environment in charge of recommending
[SPEAKER_03]: testing standards based on medical reports
and published scientific literature.
[SPEAKER_03]: When the Colorado Department of Revenue
set the previous limits in the wake of
[SPEAKER_03]: Amendment 64's passage, it was a fast and
furious process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Van Dyke said, there were times you came
up with numbers because that's what you
[SPEAKER_03]: came up with at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Despite the eye-popping increases,
he said new limits adhere more strictly to
[SPEAKER_03]: the latest available evidence in
scientific research.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot more to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to skim it real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: That model of we picked a number and we
kind of pulled it out of our ass,
[SPEAKER_04]: but we just went with the much more
restrictive sounding rule to start off
[SPEAKER_04]: with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we're dialing it back to more in
line with reality.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're going to see that in a lot
of different areas of regulation in
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're realizing that in a lot of ways,
we way overdid it in some areas.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't surprise me that this is one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't be surprised in the next two
years to see a lot of different testing
[SPEAKER_04]: rules and regulations tweaked up and down
as we learn more and we finally get around
[SPEAKER_04]: to checking the research.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our driving limit, for example,
the five nanograms, that's just a rule
[SPEAKER_04]: another state had in place and they just
pulled it out of their ass.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no research at all to tie it with
that, but we made that part of our law
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't be allowed near a car.
[SPEAKER_03]: Five nanograms was a real thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried to have my primary care physician
run the test on me after not smoking all
[SPEAKER_04]: night and then going in in the morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she didn't know which test to run.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I had to run three different THC
tests and all of them, whatever the test
[SPEAKER_04]: result came back, I was way above five.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're doing that research now.
[SPEAKER_04]: That research just got funded in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in two years, three years, we'll have
more information to change that rule.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's going to happen in a
lot of places.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't surprise me that it's happening
here with PPM limits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the article keeps going and the guy
says, actually, frankly, no, he doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: say actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: He actually says, frankly, we're not
saying that extracted marijuana products
[SPEAKER_03]: should have 5,000 PPMs of butane in them.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Colorado, he said, what we're saying is
5,000 is a health-based limit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he, then it goes on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I'm reading way too fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: But didn't he just acknowledge the
possibility of literally smelling butane
[SPEAKER_03]: in the BHO approved by the state for
medical patients?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there may be a lot of market
drivers that push those numbers lower,
[SPEAKER_03]: Van Dyke acknowledged.
[SPEAKER_03]: And smell could certainly be one of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he repeated, it's not from a health
perspective that those numbers should be
[SPEAKER_03]: lower.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are residual solvents,
but are residual solvents merely a matter
[SPEAKER_03]: of product taste and quality or is
scientific research still too limited to
[SPEAKER_03]: inspire consumer confidence?
[SPEAKER_03]: It may be a little bit of both.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I'm going to jump in right
now because even if we're allowed to put
[SPEAKER_03]: 5,000 particles per million to leave that
in there and not purge it out properly,
[SPEAKER_03]: most consumers are educated enough to go,
I don't want that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they would go by.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've got two different products of
shatter on my table right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: One was a gift.
[SPEAKER_03]: One will probably remain on this piece of
parchment paper until the end of fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: time because I do not want to dab it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other, however, was made by an artist
who took their time and their energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if you went to the dispensary,
Mike, and this dark stuff that looks like
[SPEAKER_03]: squirrel poop was here available for you
for $25.
[SPEAKER_03]: $25 a gram plus tax.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like a piece of onyx,
but it's hash shaped.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is pretty damn dark.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or this golden, shiny, sparkly stuff here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like pancake syrup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, it does look like thin maple syrup.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of gold.
[SPEAKER_04]: The syrup that's spilled on the white
plate is exactly what it looks like on the
[SPEAKER_04]: parchment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which one would you grab all day long?
[SPEAKER_03]: All day long with honey.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if this was at the store, would you
even buy it?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: See?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're an educated consumer like
myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I even know that a lot of times you
get that dark color just because the
[SPEAKER_04]: material wasn't processed quickly enough
and it had time to age a little bit before
[SPEAKER_04]: it got processed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that that hash, and if you're
listening to my podcast, my friend that
[SPEAKER_03]: makes this hash, you may listen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not tell you this when you were here
the other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were just doing our thing and I didn't
want to mention this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what's happening is if you're
using a closed loop system, the material
[SPEAKER_03]: is sitting in the butane far too long.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was talking about, this was his record
pool, how they got more hash from the
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of material that they've ever
pulled before.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because you've pulled out a bunch of
chlorophyll, my friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why the hash has got this dark
greenish color.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there's a lot of THC here,
but you lowered your THC quantity by
[SPEAKER_03]: pulling more chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_03]: You increased your weight, but you lowered
your potency.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're doing it in a closed loop
system, be a little quicker about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't leave it soaking in the soak for so
long.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the hash version of putting a coin in
your grinder.
[SPEAKER_03]: It may be time to clean the butane and the
machine also.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're doing this, if this hash was
made open blasted, what you did was you
[SPEAKER_03]: ran too many cans.
[SPEAKER_03]: You needed to stop a can before because
you're pushing it through the tube.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're pushing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going, pay attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should run piss clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should look like well hydrated pee.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be clear coming out of there.
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as you see it coming dark,
stop putting taint through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will go as far as to move my can over
the grass or over the cement and just drip
[SPEAKER_03]: it right into there and quit putting it
into my catch jar.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen people do two batch too.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I open blast into an open container,
I do it into a mason jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's got a smaller opening with
less ... I don't do this anymore,
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're looking at me like, don't say that,
but I would do it into a mason jar.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a particularly bad idea for a
couple of different reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it into the mason jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: It prevents you from getting contaminants
into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do it into a big flat Pyrex dish,
leaves and shit from the trees fall in
[SPEAKER_03]: because you've got to do it outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bugs fly into there.
[SPEAKER_03]: A fucking butterfly landed in the mix one
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: The pancake tray or the cookie tray don't
make shrapnel though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going to blow anything up the
way we ... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody says that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just don't open blast people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't make hash anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I feel free talking about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Working with butane like that,
there's safety precautions.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just one way our community keeps
fucking ourselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time some idiot blows up their
apartment or their house trying to make
[SPEAKER_04]: dabs in the backyard, just leave it to the
fucking professionals.
[SPEAKER_03]: True.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember reading in a history class
about bathtub gin and people blowing
[SPEAKER_04]: themselves up trying to make gin in the
bathtub.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought, how dumb were people back then?
[SPEAKER_04]: Then here I am 35 and my contemporaries
are doing the exact same thing with
[SPEAKER_03]: freaking hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: There weren't professionals six years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back then, the professionals were us.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Big D was a professional back then and he
was doing it with a fucking ... Until
[SPEAKER_03]: three years ago, he was doing it in a tube
in a parking lot, a professional business
[SPEAKER_03]: with a license.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were okay with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, you got to have a fucking blast proof
building and all kinds of fire equipment
[SPEAKER_03]: and suits and all training and hazmat
material.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a way different world now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let those professionals do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that if we legalize cannabis
everywhere ... Well, no, it's definitely a
[SPEAKER_04]: legalization in the market because a lot
of the places where the frequent BHO home
[SPEAKER_04]: cook blowups are happening are in
legalization states where it's 65,
[SPEAKER_04]: 75 a gram on the shelf for 75% black
shatter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or illegal states where there is no
option.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and then in places where there's no
legal access.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have to grow your own and make your
own, you fucking will because people want
[SPEAKER_03]: to get high.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to do what they have to to
get high, to get medicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's not available, they're going to
figure out a way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since they just grew some shitty weed
because they can't get the products to
[SPEAKER_03]: grow proper weed, now they got to do
something with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just go get some butane,
run it through some cans and blow up the
[SPEAKER_03]: house and make this look even worse.
[SPEAKER_04]: The more legal it is, the more likely you
are to screw up the safety precautions you
[SPEAKER_04]: need to take.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's just legal, then you can just go
to the store and get it on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Colorado, you can go, I can think of
four places I can go right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got all the hash I want.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never made it.
[SPEAKER_03]: For 20, 25, 35 a gram for good fire
shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no reason to risk blowing your
house up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to keep reading this article.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like we've gotten through the gist
of the article, but I'm going to keep
[SPEAKER_03]: reading it anyway, just because it feels
like there's more.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, a knowledge problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of eyes widened when I talked to
people who weren't aware of Colorado's new
[SPEAKER_03]: standards.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some consumers believe that industrial
solvents are inherently hazardous to their
[SPEAKER_03]: health and should be avoided at virtually
any level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many concentrate consumers now opt for
solventless extracts, such as rosin or
[SPEAKER_03]: bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Others don't worry as much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pointing out, then it says accurately,
according to most scientists I talked to,
[SPEAKER_03]: that someone who smells a whiff of butane
from a Bic lighter has already inhaled way
[SPEAKER_03]: more than they'll get in a day of dabbing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great, a great comparison.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he's sitting there talking about
tasting it in the hash at 5,000 ppm,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I'm sitting there thinking about
refilling my torch.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when your torch gets full and you get
that little blowback, I guarantee you
[SPEAKER_04]: you're at way more than 5,000 ppm of
butane in the air around your head.
[SPEAKER_04]: In that moment, as it's blasted out
excess, I mean, I'm sure it dissipates
[SPEAKER_04]: quickly, but I don't taste butane then.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I haven't just forced that through a
several hundred degree now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy goes on to say, it's not the
butane, said Nick Mosley, co-owner and
[SPEAKER_03]: chief science officer at Confidence
Analytics, a cannabis testing laboratory
[SPEAKER_03]: in Washington state.
[SPEAKER_03]: The butane is really not a huge health
risk, he said, adding that it takes quite
[SPEAKER_03]: a bit, way more than you'd get from
dabbing or a vape pin to cause serious
[SPEAKER_03]: harm, such as liver damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's a 1981 case study cited
by the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: Department of Health and Human Services
found that exposure to 10,000 ppms for 10
[SPEAKER_03]: minutes may lead to drowsiness,
but doesn't appear to cause systemic
[SPEAKER_03]: effects in humans.
[SPEAKER_03]: The average dab consists of about 10
milligrams to 20 milligrams of
[SPEAKER_03]: concentrate, Mosley at Confidence
Analytics said.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the eyes of Colorado regulators,
he added, these class three solvents are
[SPEAKER_03]: not cause for concern at 5,000 ppms when
the dose of the substance is so low.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they go on to say, Mosley did call
the levels of xylenes and benzene in
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado concerning.
[SPEAKER_03]: The issue with xylenes and benzene,
he explained, is that the contaminants are
[SPEAKER_03]: unintentionally there.
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, those chemicals aren't
part of the extraction process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those chemicals are sometimes used to
clean equipment and may inadvertently
[SPEAKER_03]: become part of the final product.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, that's shit that sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're also sometimes found in low
quality solvents.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you don't distill your butane
properly, in other words, their
[SPEAKER_03]: contaminants in the contaminant,
Mosley wasn't, their contaminants in the
[SPEAKER_03]: contaminant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mosley wasn't trying to criticize
Colorado's new limits from a health
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective, though he didn't sound
especially jazzed about the idea of
[SPEAKER_03]: finding those residual levels in a
concentrate either.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just meant that a higher, but soon to
be a legal level of residuals could
[SPEAKER_03]: indicate careless extraction methods or
low quality products.
[SPEAKER_03]: And see, that's what a lot of people's
concern is gonna be, that this is gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: make extractors lazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I don't have to take all this out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hurry up and get this out of the vac
oven so we can get the next batch in the
[SPEAKER_03]: vac oven, because this is gonna pass lab
tests.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is gonna be able to go on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_04]: The limits were drastically increased,
but they were still drastically increased
[SPEAKER_04]: to a number so small that it's
unnoticeable.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a super tiny amount.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you think about all the other
testing and stuff that goes into it,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is a conversation we're only able to
have because it's insanely legal here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Statewide, we have access to product
unmatched anywhere in the US as far as
[SPEAKER_04]: testing and labeling goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know more about the product we're
consuming than anyone on the planet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And going through these rulemaking
hearings is part of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are the limits for anything else on
the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not encouraging extractors to push the
envelope of the upper limits that are
[SPEAKER_04]: allowed now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if these are allowed for any other
product I buy in a store or a pharmacy,
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see why they shouldn't be allowed
for my hash either.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also understand the movement away
from solvent-made hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get the people that are looking for
high-grade water extract.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people are on that rosin train,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people love rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people are haters of BHO.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: A big part of the marijuana community came
here fleeing the pharmaceutical industry
[SPEAKER_04]: for one reason or another.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the idea of their marijuana industry
moving towards that model in any way is
[SPEAKER_04]: scary.
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving away from natural in any way is
scary to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate to be the one to point out that
their flowers in the BHO hash are almost
[SPEAKER_04]: identical in every way except for a little
bit of solvent used in the extract.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything that's in that flower is going
to be in that extract, including all the
[SPEAKER_04]: bad shit that's already in your flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because it's a plant doesn't mean
it's good for you or natural in the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: For a little bit, a lot of people were
under the impression that the clear and
[SPEAKER_03]: distillate was removing solvents,
but we have recently discovered that that
[SPEAKER_03]: is not true.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to use a separate filter to get
out pesticides and solvents from the
[SPEAKER_03]: clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting rid of the solvents because
we're heating it high enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the pesticides that we're not getting
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said that wrong probably because I took
too many dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were a lot of rumors about the
clear, and 99% of them were just bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do love some wellness.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had some amazing distillate,
but I don't at all understand the hype for
[SPEAKER_04]: the clear.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know people that are obsessed with the
clear that rant and rave about it because
[SPEAKER_04]: of the hype and not because of its actual
properties.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would prefer my distillate to come
without turps and let me put my own turps
[SPEAKER_03]: in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the way I would prefer it.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things I really like in my
hash, the reason I'm such a live resin
[SPEAKER_04]: fanatic, is that flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all already there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just scoop and glob.
[SPEAKER_04]: I glob, teeny glob.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to let you have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Taking the distillate, dunking it,
that's fun for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't want to build it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things I love about cannabis is
the huge flavor profile variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more fun to me to taste what that
flower was supposed to taste like than
[SPEAKER_04]: going to the soda factory and having them
do 25 different syrups.
[SPEAKER_04]: To create that soda flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just like when you can take some
distillate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like they overdo it when they go
mixing the turps in on their own when they
[SPEAKER_03]: sell me the distillate.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's overdone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every distillate I've had that has
terpenes reintroduced has way overdone it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd rather just be able to do it myself
and then I can buy a bottle of distillate
[SPEAKER_03]: and three or four vials of turps and mix
and match and make it the way I want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then when I run out of that distillate,
I just put the turps right on my shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been getting little tiny pipettes and
just dipping it right onto the shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do believe that the terpenoids
contribute heavily to my high because I
[SPEAKER_03]: can dab the same shatter and put different
turps on it and you get different effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: You tease the future show about lab
testing and how it's changed some things.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely helped us lose focus on
the variety of compounds in the plant that
[SPEAKER_04]: influence the high, the experience,
the medical effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait for that show for these
reasons exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many different parts of the
cannabis plant that influence its effect
[SPEAKER_04]: on you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you're exactly right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Turpenes are a huge portion of the medical
effect and the high.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can feel it with that 100% distillate
when you go from a Ghost Train Haze Turps
[SPEAKER_04]: to an OG Kush Turps that you're dunking it
in.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can feel the high difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the exact same THC, the exact same.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you add in the other stuff that
doesn't affect the high, it's the
[SPEAKER_04]: non-psychoactive stuff that doesn't scare
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: It completely changes the high.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was blown away the first time I
experienced it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about the other pieces,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about that entourage slash
synergistic effect, however you want to
[SPEAKER_03]: call it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the term entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so descriptive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and it's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because like you said, when I smoke these
Ghost Train Haze Turps right here,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a bottle rocket on your dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: You take your dab and you're like,
oh, I'm high for my dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a second later, you're like,
I keep getting higher.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're like, is this ever going to
fucking stop?
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you put the same dab and take some
of that OG Kush like you were talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about, you go, oh, I'm going to get low
for a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you start like, you want to drool on
yourself for a couple seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you take the, I think it's called
paradigium, you take that one,
[SPEAKER_03]: I get hyper from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, whoa, with all that,
I want to go run around now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they all have, there's something in
those terpenoids that's doing something
[SPEAKER_03]: completely different to your body and to
your mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just releases different chemicals,
triggers different things.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, lab testing has changed.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we look for is, is consumers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's drastically changing the
consumption experience.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I hope that allowing more PPMs in
our concentrates does not encourage hash
[SPEAKER_03]: makers to lazy up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting really good at concentrate
making here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope that people just keep getting
better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to the people that are
encouraging and learning and making better
[SPEAKER_03]: hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think anybody was really excited
about this as far as, yay, now we can
[SPEAKER_04]: shave 45 seconds off our back oven cook.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when I first heard about this
happening, I was like, oh, what the fuck
[SPEAKER_03]: is happening?
[SPEAKER_03]: But now that I've read the article,
I think I understand a little more and I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: not as nervous or paranoid about the
increase.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's ever a BHO where I can taste
butane in it, you can guarantee that that
[SPEAKER_03]: hash is going away.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a little worried when it was only
Leafly was kind of reporting this and I
[SPEAKER_04]: was happy to see the level of reporting
they did.
[SPEAKER_04]: But because they're not a hardcore news
org, you see that wander a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy, I'm guessing he just said it is
something dumb during the interview and
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been interviewed a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know sometimes stupid shit slips out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see plenty of shit on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: A good reporter will skip over the brain
fart that you uttered on the record and
[SPEAKER_04]: stick to the on topic point.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this reporter got hung up on the,
we might be talking about levels that
[SPEAKER_04]: consumers could smell or taste.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he goes on to say how these
levels are perfectly allowed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And pharmaceutical products, if you can
allow 5,000 PPM of butane in a buterol
[SPEAKER_04]: inhaler, have a buterol inhaler people
with that level of people, have they
[SPEAKER_04]: reported the taste?
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be part of the study that he's
citing for the increase and it's not.
[SPEAKER_04]: But because he mentioned that to a
reporter who's not obsessed with keeping
[SPEAKER_04]: the story clean and factual and got hung
up on something dumb, the guy said at the
[SPEAKER_04]: beginning, and now half of people that
read that story are like, man,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not buying hashed Colorado anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: It tastes like butane.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, you will know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are going to be lab tests.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I see your container?
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got there the East Coast Panama.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got the lab testing real well on
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is from Turpex and it is East Coast
Panama chunk wax.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's labeled a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next numbers listed on here are the
MIP, which is the Marijuana Infused
[SPEAKER_03]: Product License.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got the license number of who made
the hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got the OPC number, which is the
Optional Premises Cultivation Center,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's got their ID number.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where it was grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it's got a batch number so that we
know which batch of plants went into this
[SPEAKER_03]: mix by researching the batch number.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can tell you what plant tags were in
here, which is each individual plant,
[SPEAKER_04]: which if they did it properly- And that's
how they track.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the numbers they use to do
recall tracking in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can tell you if that plant has been
applied a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can tell you everything that plant has
been sprayed with, fed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can tell you the date it was cut as a
clone, the day it was moved into flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can tell you everything about,
mostly everything about that plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: if it were properly documented by the
grower and the metric supervisor at that
[SPEAKER_03]: facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times shit tries to pass through.
[SPEAKER_03]: Testing results are what's going to reveal
the truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm looking at this container and it's
got test results on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It shows me how much CBGA, CBG,
CBDA, CBD, THCA, THC, and total
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids are on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I assume that in the very near future,
they're going to include these particles
[SPEAKER_03]: per million testing on here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of these rule changes were labeling
changes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That product- Is this an old?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an old product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the hash I've got is a couple of
months old now.
[SPEAKER_04]: You kind of hold the hash for a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love stockpiling so that I can hit,
every time I go to DAB, I've got 35
[SPEAKER_04]: different flavors to choose from.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: DAB's going to rob us.
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes some planning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every now and then I realize that I've had
a hash container for a year, 14 months,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then I make a point to smoke it all
real quick so that it doesn't convert any
[SPEAKER_04]: further.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you need some help, let me know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm happy to.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can take DAB's.
[SPEAKER_04]: Old high THC stuff that's had some aging
to it is really good on inflammation and
[SPEAKER_04]: pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: It converts into some other fun stuff
that's really good on inflammation and
pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it decarboxylates a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It loses a decarboxyl group.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a reason to stash and a reason not to
worry if it gets a little old.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a hoarder, but this labeling isn't up
to par.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still better than 99% of the legal
marijuana products you're going to find
[SPEAKER_04]: sold in the US.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing with this other hash container
I've bought.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've worn this label down a little bit,
but totally different container,
[SPEAKER_04]: totally different shape, totally different
company, exact same information.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one, if you look closely,
you can see that the butane PPMs are
[SPEAKER_04]: listed on this label.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you read it still?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can read that it used to be there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I believe it's triple zeros for
both of the butane and whatever that next
[SPEAKER_04]: butane was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pentane.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see propane.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was actually 2.75 left.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not much at all, but it's for some live
resins, so that's to be a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: expected.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be a little bit of
residual solvent left in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a lot of moisture going on,
so it'll hold onto some stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost like- Looks like sugary
butter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plato sand.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you ever did the thing
with water and cornstarch, but if you ever
[SPEAKER_04]: scratched your fingernail and scratched
some of that out of there, it's about that
[SPEAKER_04]: consistency to work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would totally dab that stuff by the
looks of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love this company.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really want to shout them out
because we've done a lot of shout outs on
[SPEAKER_04]: this show, but they make some awesome live
resin, and I drive really far to get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, sometimes in Colorado, people are
like, but there are stores everywhere,
Nick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I drive up to Denver to this one
place.
[SPEAKER_04]: I drive from West Pueblo, not Pueblo West,
but the west side of Pueblo to the very
[SPEAKER_04]: far north end of Denver.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like 126 miles.
[SPEAKER_04]: I drive past at least 300 marijuana stores
to go to the one with the product I like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I do and have done and will do
the same thing in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are two or three dispensaries in
Denver that I like to really shop at.
Yup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so you guys, don't worry about
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to be that big of a deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you come to Colorado to buy some
concentrates and you get these high
[SPEAKER_03]: numbers, you're going to notice if
something's wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be paranoid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't let the PPM numbers freak you out.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're buying shatter and it shatters,
you don't have to worry about residual
[SPEAKER_04]: butane.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're probably doing all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's on the shelf and they've got it,
it's a store.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're probably doing okay because they'll
get concentrates that shit won't sell.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll go on sale.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll get rid of it the first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll never buy it again.
Yup.
[SPEAKER_03]: The employees are customers as well most
of the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, as a consumer that doesn't really
know a whole lot, the one thing you want
[SPEAKER_04]: to look out for is if you go to a shop and
they go, I mean, just for example,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is 50, this is 55, this is 65.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and we have these for $19.99.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be wary of the $19.99.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a reason that there's that big,
big discount for that one particular
[SPEAKER_04]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be old, it might be about to pass
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: A friend of mine had to throw out a whole
bunch of product at his store because
[SPEAKER_04]: labels expired and you can't just slap on
a new label.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's terrible.
[SPEAKER_04]: When that date's getting close,
you'll watch it go from full price to half
[SPEAKER_04]: price to exactly what the shop paid for
it, to half of what the shop paid for it,
[SPEAKER_04]: to please God, let me get any of my money
back on it before you know, the first or
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever hits.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes as a consumer that can be
real helpful and sometimes that just means
[SPEAKER_04]: that's the crap that they got tricked into
buying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just took a gnarly dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you did.
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole room just fogged up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I got half a dab off your dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I want to mention is something
I've experienced in Colorado and I'm going
[SPEAKER_03]: to quit talking funny here in just a
second.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I'm going to sneeze and cough,
but something that happens, an extraction
[SPEAKER_03]: company, and we're just going to say that
Mike and I have an extraction company.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Jeff and Mike's extraction company,
we make extracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's our specialty.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we do is we go to dispensaries that
have a grow involved in their business
[SPEAKER_03]: plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a dispensary with a grow that
grows product and that product goes to the
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensary for sale.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we offer to do as an extraction
company is we will take either your buds
[SPEAKER_03]: or your trim.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever material you want to give us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we would gladly turn it into product
for you for a price.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is usually, I don't know how much
insider info I should give, but there's
[SPEAKER_03]: usually a deal worked out to where there's
an industry range.
[SPEAKER_03]: I run it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We run it as a company and we split it
with you 50-50.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we get half of the product that's
done.
[SPEAKER_03]: We package it and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we deliver your portion back to
the store and you put it on the shelf for
[SPEAKER_03]: sale.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now the other way to do it is we run
it and we sell it back to your dispensary
[SPEAKER_03]: at a price.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those prices vary widely depending on
the company.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the deals that you work out and how
much product you're running.
[SPEAKER_03]: The quality of the product, the final
product consistency.
[SPEAKER_03]: The popularity of the companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're one of the top known grows and
one of the top known extract companies,
[SPEAKER_03]: they'll run the shit for damn near free
for each other so that they can both say,
[SPEAKER_03]: ran by these companies and they both make
a ton of fucking money off of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll usually see a pretty tight range in
hash pricing at the shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, it'll be like a 10 or a $15
window.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the cheapest one in that window is
usually a company you've never heard of.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that doesn't mean anything other than
they're new and or small.
[SPEAKER_03]: A good example of them, of that company,
of that range is a company called
[SPEAKER_03]: Extracts, Inc.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are not known, but I think lately
they have been kicking out some
[SPEAKER_03]: ridiculously good concentrates at a very
low price.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their packaging is plain.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have any advertising,
but the shit is good once you crack that
[SPEAKER_03]: package open.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen a half dozen new extract
companies that I've never heard of before,
[SPEAKER_04]: where the first product I see from them is
Stellar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Incredibles.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had no idea that they were doing hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: They make some of the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first time I saw it, it was actually
granny that had it.
[SPEAKER_04]: She opened it up and I was like,
holy shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a company down here that they used
to come into the shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was working out all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's brand new and just getting on their
feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've seen some really nice stuff from
them lately.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice to see this much quality come
on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming on the market was something where I
was headed with all of this is what if you
[SPEAKER_03]: find if you buy an extract from an extract
company, say you get something,
[SPEAKER_03]: what do we name our company?
[SPEAKER_03]: I gave us a name, but Mike and Jeff's
extract.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever the fuck I call this earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are running material grown by other
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to throw them right under the
fucking bus.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we buy some material from Maggie's farm
and run it, it's going to come out brown
[SPEAKER_03]: and janky.
[SPEAKER_03]: It always does.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen several extract companies run
Maggie's farm stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something about their grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they trim with the trim machine,
which will fuck up your extract.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're using old material,
which will fuck up your extract.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their stuff never comes out good.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you run stuff from kind love,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you run material from kind love,
it always comes back fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: A good portion of the hash work is up to
the company that's running your extract,
[SPEAKER_03]: but a large portion of it is up to whoever
grew that material, how long the material
[SPEAKER_03]: set around, how it was stored,
how it was trimmed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a huge factor.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you buy some extracts from a hash
company, if you buy some Mike and Jeff
[SPEAKER_03]: extracts and it's shitty one time and
amazing one time, you kind of got to keep
[SPEAKER_03]: in mind to go look at this little OPC and
MIP tag on here and see what the OPC
[SPEAKER_03]: number is because that will tell you who
grew it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It varies wildly batch to batch with some
companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other companies that are a little more
established, I see less variety in what
[SPEAKER_04]: they're putting on shelves.
[SPEAKER_04]: For a while, like a year and a half ago,
you would see like A plus, F plus.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean in the same ship.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the products will be really,
really good for a little while and then
[SPEAKER_03]: one guy will quit and everything just
falls apart until they re-figure it out
[SPEAKER_03]: with the new.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other side of that coin is if you go
to a shop and you see a strain you like
[SPEAKER_04]: and you take a look at the hash and it's a
quality that looks good to you and you
[SPEAKER_04]: take it home and you hate it and you love
it and you want more, go back and get more
[SPEAKER_04]: right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because just the nature of the industry,
extract companies buy what's available.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no guarantee that that strain is
going to be made available to that extract
[SPEAKER_04]: company again.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it does, then it'll be that quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: That same artist or team of people will be
doing the extraction in the same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times that'll be a blend of
flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: The extractors will take a minimum of
usually a thousand grams to run.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't want less than a thousand
grams.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what fits in their column.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you had a thousand grams of something,
it would be buds and it wouldn't be a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of fucking shake to run.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wouldn't even happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they're putting, what is this?
[SPEAKER_03]: You got East Coast, Pineapple.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a real strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you got some Blue Dream and some
Golden Go.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see it all the time when it sounds
like two names swish together on the hash
[SPEAKER_04]: container.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's almost always what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been going for an hour, but you just
put me on something that I want to bitch
[SPEAKER_03]: about.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate it when extract companies do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It bothers me.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a medical product, we don't need
extract companies creating fucking names
[SPEAKER_03]: out of their hash blends.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the same issue with growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give it a minute, stabilize it,
then rename it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a renaming thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that I find important.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are strains that are well-known.
[SPEAKER_03]: Certain people rely on certain strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grateful Dog works well for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a blue headband and I have no
fucking clue what that blue is from.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably Blueberry or Blue Dream,
but you don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would much prefer if the whole blend was
labeled out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish that extract company would have put
Blue Dream and Blue or Headband so that we
[SPEAKER_03]: know what you're smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if that works wonderfully for you,
we can go find more Blueberry or Blue
[SPEAKER_03]: Dream and more Headband for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're also creating confusion because
what if somebody does have blue headband
[SPEAKER_03]: as a real flower and a real cross that a
breeder actually took their time to make?
[SPEAKER_04]: The part that kills it for the consumer is
people are creatures of habit.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to go to the store and they want
their fucking six pack of Corona.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want the same thing when they go to
the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to walk in and get their three
favorite things just like they do at every
[SPEAKER_04]: other store in their world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, when you walk into a
marijuana store, I understand that you
[SPEAKER_04]: really loved that Blue Dream you bought
last week.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a really good cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was real popular.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're out of that now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's where it falls in the range of
genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's stuff that's similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck picking a new one.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can come back tomorrow and ask for
more Blue Dream and we ain't going to have
[SPEAKER_04]: it then either.
[SPEAKER_03]: But maybe in 54 days?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eventually there will be more,
but when that will be and when it's stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: like hash, the store has almost no ability
to call the extract company and be like,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, we need more sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: There might be some sour diesel available
that they're about to run for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: There might not be any offered to that
extract company for years unless they're
[SPEAKER_04]: growing the stuff they're processing or
unless the shop is selling the material to
[SPEAKER_04]: the extract company.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no way to guarantee that material
is going to be there when it's time to
[SPEAKER_04]: re-up a shipment.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're forced to go find new stuff that
you like, which is good and bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it because I like a big variety
with my cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get why it pisses so many people off.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my opinion, it's too specific about
their THC and cannabis needs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that they're a little spoiled and
they should just smoke some dope and
[SPEAKER_03]: relax.
[SPEAKER_03]: But some people like, I cannot smoke stuff
with the word Kush or this in it,
[SPEAKER_03]: or I cannot smoke heavy sativas.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's part of the evolutionary process
where our brains are designed to remember
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff that we didn't like or that we
perceived as hurtful.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when it's stuff like foods and
intoxicants, we hold onto those memories
[SPEAKER_04]: for life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's got that one alcoholic
beverage that they got a hold of when they
[SPEAKER_04]: were 13, 14, 15, and drank it like it was
water and then threw up for a day and a
[SPEAKER_04]: half.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now they can't even see sour apple
pucker or banana red mad dog or whatever
[SPEAKER_04]: the fuck without getting a little
nauseous.
[SPEAKER_03]: You took that to a personal place,
didn't you?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's actually, I doubt that person
with those two references, are there
[SPEAKER_04]: things would ever listen to the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: But on the off chance, they do that laugh
really hard when they hear that part.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for me, it's Miller Lite, MGD's.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shouldn't be drinking that piss anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was what was there when we were that
age and a friend drank way too much of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He did the infamous puke fart and I was
hung over for like five days.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now even when I see the label,
I throw up in my mouth a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I used to have to go buy it for
somebody in my life a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was always a fun trip back from
the store because I'm trying not to look
[SPEAKER_04]: at what's in the passenger seat because
it's making me nauseous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Until I felt about rum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rum was not my thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same thing with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody smokes way too much kush one
night and it's how much they consumed,
[SPEAKER_04]: how they consumed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have anything to do with the
strain or that it was an indica.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now every time they go to a
dispensary, they make a big deal about how
[SPEAKER_04]: it can't be kushed to their bud tender or
it can't say Durbin in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That, you know, I smoked too much Durbin
the first time I came to Colorado and I
[SPEAKER_04]: was alone in my hotel room and I ate that
whole, that whole brownie and then I
[SPEAKER_04]: smoked that Durbin poison and it was just
too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want that Durbin.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, dude, it was, didn't have
nothing to do with what strain you picked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but explaining that is difficult.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when they get there and the,
the one thing they found that they really
[SPEAKER_04]: like you're out of, and they have to start
the process all over again, like it can be
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of headachy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish more people expected it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to regulate it a little bit
better.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got the products that people
want, but it's hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to remind myself how lucky we are
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: The good shit sells out.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a first world problem in the extreme.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we're so spoiled here with,
uh, our marijuana markets in the,
[SPEAKER_04]: the vast assortment of products that's
available in that market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I mean, prices are coming down,
qualities going up, uh, selections going
[SPEAKER_04]: up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good for, we've got weed
suppositories now.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can take your weed in every way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put some weed pain cream on today before
I left the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: I gave them both knees a coat before I
started getting ready to come over for the
[SPEAKER_04]: show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we've got suppositories, we've got
lozenges, we've got sprays, we've got
[SPEAKER_04]: pills, we've got flowers, we've got a
hundred different kinds of hash now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, when you go to this, when you went to
a dispensary a year and a half ago,
[SPEAKER_04]: open was the only vape pen, um,
on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now there are hundreds of vape pen
companies, you know, with hundreds of
[SPEAKER_04]: different qualities, hundreds of different
strain options.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I love that things are strain specific
now too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so great.
[SPEAKER_03]: This strain specific edibles, strain
specific vape pens.
[SPEAKER_03]: That shit is so great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of just Indica, Sativa or hybrid,
you can get actual specifics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we move closer to the, the micro brew
model every day, um, with the quality and
[SPEAKER_04]: the selection of products that we've
found.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got, and it's absolutely wonderful.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I look at, uh, I mean,
just next door to us, most of the states
[SPEAKER_04]: that surround Colorado are still under
full prohibition where, uh, my friends
[SPEAKER_04]: scored a handful of good herb or good
weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's what they know about it is
that their friends scored it and it's
[SPEAKER_04]: good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the end of the information that
they will ever have on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't miss those days when you go to get
some weed and they had some weed and you
[SPEAKER_03]: got whatever was there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, uh, that was one of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: The things I like most about working the
retail counter is watching people's faces
[SPEAKER_04]: light up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they were just learning about Santa
as a small kid.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get to choose.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get to watch the numbers on the scale
from my side and your side.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so much fun watching people's faces
light up when they see what the
[SPEAKER_04]: possibilities really are for this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but then again, I read stuff like how
it is on the East coast right now in a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of places and I just cringe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's why we're here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to educate everybody so that
we can legalize places everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, because we've been going for an
hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's time to start wrapping up this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can go for an hour and five minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I legalize it everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see any other, any better way to
wrap the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Legalize it everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than asking for people to follow,
follow Mike on Twitter, follow us on punk
[SPEAKER_03]: 15.
[SPEAKER_03]: Follow me on Twitter at GFYH podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Follow me on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, check me out on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: I re underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at my cannabis photography.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it would be cool if you go to iTunes,
uh, search for the grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_03]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should definitely do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So click on the little icon there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to the ratings and review section.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me a, leave me a review and give me a

[SPEAKER_03]: So far everybody has left me a five star
review.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are 39 or 45 star reviews at this
point in time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be like everybody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Throw me that five star review.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not begging for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you think I deserve go for it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, also Patreon, you guys, uh,
don't forget about Patreon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Patreon is a service that allows you to
financially support the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: All I'm asking for is help, uh,
taking the cost of the website,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, off of my back and maybe getting a
little support from the listeners.
[SPEAKER_03]: The podcast will always be free.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, I'd love giving you this
podcast, but if you'd like to go to
[SPEAKER_03]: Patreon and sign up, you can contribute as
little as $1.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think there's a limit to how
many zeros you can put on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So go for $1, go for a million dollars,
however you'd like to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you a shout out on the podcast
to say thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to see you contribute a
million.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will convince him to do something a
little bigger than a shot you out on the
[SPEAKER_04]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do a podcast about whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you send me a million dollars,
if you've, we'll talk about whatever you
[SPEAKER_03]: want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Million bucks, anything in a million
bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who wouldn't right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, patreon.com, no, patreon.com slash
grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not asking anybody for a million
dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: $1 is plenty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, if you cannot contribute, please keep
listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a few people out there that will
throw down a dollar.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll help with what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to cover the cost of the
website to keep the podcast coming to you
[SPEAKER_03]: so that it doesn't come out of my pocket.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can cover it, but I'd rather not.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, if you find that you got some value
from the show, go ahead and throw me a
[SPEAKER_03]: buck.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can't do it, times are tough.
[SPEAKER_03]: I fucking get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the one asking you for money.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't be mad that you don't have any
extra money.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I totally get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I appreciate the people that can
contribute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Truly do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, I feel like I'm going on for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike, I owe you a huge thank you for
coming and doing two podcasts with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, did we crush it tonight?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we did a good job.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you did a great job.
[SPEAKER_03]: I let you talk for a whole bunch because
you had a lot of shit on your mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess it's been a really fun couple
of weeks in news.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has been a lot of scary news
announcements, but there's been a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: good ones too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I cannot wait to see what the future
brings.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 2017 is going to be interesting as
shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not all in good ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just made 37 facial expressions,
trying to think about the different
[SPEAKER_03]: possibilities for next year.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like on total recall and the
dude's mask broke.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing that got less likely is the
aliens making contact.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guaranteed if they're watching us from
above, they're continuing their policy of
[SPEAKER_04]: wait and see for the next four years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, pretty much every fucking
other possibility from peace on Earth to
[SPEAKER_04]: nuclear war got like five percent more
likely this year to last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, it's going to be an interesting
year for damn sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's absolutely going to be an interesting
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: That dude's got the combination to the
button.
[SPEAKER_04]: The least confusing thing so far about
Trump being elected is Trump getting
[SPEAKER_04]: elected, which is confusing in its own
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But all of the decisions he's made since
election night have been more confusing
[SPEAKER_04]: than America choosing to elect him.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, if you're not following Trump's
Twitter feed, just give that shit a
[SPEAKER_03]: follow.
[SPEAKER_04]: My wife finally broke down and created a
Twitter feed to follow it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to follow Trump.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to follow Trump.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, go check it out you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're pooping or whatever you're
doing, just go give it a good follow and
[SPEAKER_03]: just like his tweets because it's
hilarious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't feel the need to like them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should be following them.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you should do though is go to Twitter
and follow the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_03]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should definitely follow us on
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can find me on there also.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm at Rasta Jeff 420.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love it if you'd follow me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love all the social interaction.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to contact me and interact
with me or if you've got a product that
[SPEAKER_03]: you would like me to review and you don't
want to reach out on social media,
[SPEAKER_03]: send me an email.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know I'd love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am slowly working my way through all of
the emails that people send me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am overwhelmed by messages, but keep
them coming because I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am going to get through all of them
before the end of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully I get to your problem in your
garden before your garden is harvested.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: The email is the best way to ask good
questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got a grow question or a policy
question or a good question for Jeff that
[SPEAKER_04]: you'd like him to answer on the show,
email is the best way to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've repeatedly seen him contact and then
drag the appropriate person to respond or
[SPEAKER_04]: the person that was requested to respond
back on the show to get your question
[SPEAKER_04]: answered.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: What other podcaster is going to recruit
people from Denver to come down and answer
[SPEAKER_03]: your organics question?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I drive to Denver for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 130 miles, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, we're going to wrap up the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been an hour and 10, an hour and 11
minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank everybody for listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike, huge thanks again for coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy to, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for having me.
Going to send you home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Going to send you home back to the family
real quick here after a couple more days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Listeners, I hope you enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks so much for having me again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, you're invited back.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have you millions of more times.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to make this podcast go a
billion episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: A billion episodes?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a huge goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a huge goal.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to need to get together more
than a couple of times a month to record
[SPEAKER_03]: that, buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys, I want to thank everybody for
listening, guys and gals.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are not gingers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ladies and gentlemen, children of all ages
and everything in between.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank everybody for listening to
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's getting a shout out this week?
[SPEAKER_03]: How about everybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to the coming new year.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I want to give a shout out to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to 2016 being over and 2017
starting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to New Beginnings.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, thanks again for listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to give you a huge shout out to my
ninja Spence.
[SPEAKER_03]: Until next time, take a fat dad and give
your mom a hug for me.
I'll see
[SPEAKER_02]: you guys next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you guys next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep me in a deep dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep me going strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to save me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sad is my song.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you believe in things you don't
understand, then you suffer.
[SPEAKER_02]: She pushes your name away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very superstitious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing more to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very superstitious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Devils on the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seven years of bad, good things in your
past.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Superstition ain't the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Superstition ain't the way.
