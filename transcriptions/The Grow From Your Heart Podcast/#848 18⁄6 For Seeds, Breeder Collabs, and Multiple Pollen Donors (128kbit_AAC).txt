[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back podcast world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode 848 of the grow from your
heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've got another fun episode
lined up for us in today's show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give away free seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk more about those free seeds in
just a moment before we jump into the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to talk about my recent weekend
vacation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you listen to the show, I did mention I
was taking a break to go on a vacation and
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a super good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I flew to Las Vegas and I got to see the
last two Dead and Company shows at the
[SPEAKER_01]: Sphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: The band was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Sphere was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The visuals at the Sphere were awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody at the Sphere was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the friends that I saw there and
made there were amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we ran into each other at the Dead and
Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: experience in Vegas this weekend,
if I give you a high five, a fist bump,
[SPEAKER_01]: or maybe a hug, maybe we shared a
conversation, perhaps we hit each other's
[SPEAKER_01]: pins, I gave somebody a pin also,
if that was you that I gave a pin to you,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of those folks, if I met you for the
first time and gave you a fist bump,
[SPEAKER_01]: we got a handshake, if we've been internet
friends and finally got to meet at the
[SPEAKER_01]: Dead and Company shows, big thank you,
big shout out for making my Dead and
[SPEAKER_01]: Company weekend an amazing experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Sphere does not pay me to talk about
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Sphere does not pay me to advertise,
but I'll talk briefly about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe some of you just don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Sphere is a new venue in Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a big sphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: The outside of the Sphere is all a big LED
screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how to explain the
technology, but they are constantly
[SPEAKER_01]: displaying crazy video displays on the
outside of the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just drive by or walk by the
Sphere or even fly by the Sphere and see
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing visual displays on the outside,
but once you get in, it is even more
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before the show starts, it feels sort of
like you're stuck in an iPad or you're a
[SPEAKER_01]: screensaver, but once the music gets
going, it is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a 270 degree screen inside the
Sphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means everywhere you look,
except behind you, is a video screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Dead and Company, there are two
remaining members of the Grateful Dead
[SPEAKER_01]: that still play and they filled in the
rest of the band with some amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: players.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call themselves Dead and Company,
but two remaining members of the Grateful
[SPEAKER_01]: Dead tour with the rest of the band and
the Dead and Company nailed it at the
[SPEAKER_01]: Sphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: They put on an amazing show.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last two shows were extra awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: The night before the last show was
actually the 29th anniversary of the
[SPEAKER_01]: passing of Jerry Garcia, who was the lead
guitar player in the band for several
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he passed in 95.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've had several incantations or
incarnations of the band since then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, they've got John Mayer playing
guitar, which a lot of people think is
[SPEAKER_01]: wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: At first, I didn't want to like it either
seeing John Mayer with the Grateful Dead,
[SPEAKER_01]: but after the first time I saw him play,
I knew that he was the guy for the job and
[SPEAKER_01]: he's been doing it for several years and
he absolutely crushed it at the Sphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dead and Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last two shows were amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Sphere was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Sphere visuals were super amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten to see four fish shows and two
Dead and Company shows and the visuals
[SPEAKER_01]: that Dead and Company put on were amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, everybody at the Sphere is super
helpful and amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't pay me to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Sphere and Dead and Company definitely
did not pay me for this free advertising,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if you get an opportunity to go see a
band that you like at the Sphere,
[SPEAKER_01]: I highly recommend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is an amazing experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to get in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to get out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The drinks, wines, and snack lines are
easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's never a real long line.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a bunch of helpful people
around there to help you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you happen to be in need of any sort of
assistance, somebody will pop out of
[SPEAKER_01]: nowhere and help you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to the Sphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Dead and Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: and once again, big shout out to all of
the Grateful Dead family that I got to
[SPEAKER_01]: see, meet, and hang out with at the Dead
and Company shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I feel like that's enough
rambling here at the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe some of you loved that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe some of you weren't into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do try to share some of my personal
experience with you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of you have been listening for a
long time and I feel like we're friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for letting me share my
experience with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's work our way into the question
and answer portion of today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the top of the show, I said there was
an opportunity to win free seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you win those seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a website.
[SPEAKER_01]: That website is iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the top of that website, there is a row
of tabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those tabs does say grow help or
grow questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you click on that tab and you send me a
good grow question, perhaps I will read
[SPEAKER_01]: your question here on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I read that question here on the show,
I will send you a coupon code for a free
[SPEAKER_01]: pack of seeds from iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, you can get the seeds at
iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first question on today's show came
from my new friend Shaggy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my buddy Shaggy Grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question goes, just like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, hey family, I hope all is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks for so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Constantly dropping the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro, you are so welcome for dropping the
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like if I didn't share the gift of
growing, I would explode.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something I've been given,
a gift of gab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been given the gift to understand
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I didn't share that with you,
I would be disrespectful to whatever you
[SPEAKER_01]: believe in that gave me this gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am rambly and I love talking about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is how it worked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I have a breeding question for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love breeding questions and I have got a
breeding answer for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, let's just say I have a female
that has some desirable traits and it is
[SPEAKER_01]: valuable to reverse it and use it as a
donor plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I understand where you're going
with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a female plant with the traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to take two clones of it,
reverse one, use one as a donor,
[SPEAKER_01]: one as a receiver.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make S1 seeds and preserve this
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, this makes very beautiful sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, here's where it gets weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, can I do this while still using a
male plant as a donor as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they want to take that pollen from that
reversed female and they also want to take
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen from a traditional male plant and
put both of those batches of pollen on
[SPEAKER_01]: their single female pollen receiver plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that part so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't recommend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I do understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, since our favorite plant can take
multiple pollen at once, how will this
[SPEAKER_01]: affect the seeds since the reversed pollen
will only have female chromosomes?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I understand what you're
asking.
[SPEAKER_01]: How it's going to affect the seeds is
you're going to have seeds with different
[SPEAKER_01]: baby daddies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have a whole bunch of
Maury Povich sort of stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get that feminized pollen
is going to hit the plant and make
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those seeds will be female.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will be your S1.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we took that one plant and the same
plant, pollinated it, that is an S1.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be also other seeds in there
that will be F1s from that male that you
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinated that plant with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now those seeds, what they're going to do,
they're going to make male and female
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can tell that the pollen is what
determines sex.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my science, in my thinking,
pollen is what determines sex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do I believe that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm using femme pollen to make femme seeds
is what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I believe that the sex is determined by
the pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like when males and females breed,
that male sperm does contain the sex of
[SPEAKER_01]: the progeny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds and cannabis are just like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The male pollen does hold that male or
female chromosome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I take feminized pollen and I put it
on that plant, we're only going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: female seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I take that male plant and put it on
there, we're going to get male and female
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds from that because the sex does come
from the pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you're going to find is you're
going to find male plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to find female plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll also find feminized plants,
but you won't know if they're feminized
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're going to come just like
the regular female plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't know they'll be girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to get a bunch of girl
plants probably, and you're going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: male plants pop up in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like this idea because I am a
commercial seed maker, a commercial seed
[SPEAKER_01]: seller.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to know the pedigree of every
single seed which I sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't have something where I say it
could be this dad or it could be this dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't work for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't work for the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't work for my breeding,
my goals, my project.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to do this, you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just know that you've got what I call a
Maury Povich situation on your hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is the baby daddy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is not the father?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you grow these out, you're going to
get a bunch of wild different phenotypes
[SPEAKER_01]: because you've got an S1 making that
phenotype or those phenotypes,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you've got a full new F1 hybrid
showing those phenotypes in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to see a bunch of
different variation, and you may be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to identify what's what, but you may not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a breeder, I like to know what my
project is doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to know what that male did to the
female and what the female did to the
[SPEAKER_01]: female.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is kind of just making a mess,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to do this just to make a
bunch of seeds, to have some seeds to play
[SPEAKER_01]: with and create some fucking chaos and to
grow, that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But don't sell these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't give them away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't trade them.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are your private stash for you to
play with.
[SPEAKER_01]: You knew what you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're accepting the risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're accepting that outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't pawn these off on anybody else and
make them deal with your Maury,
[SPEAKER_01]: your Maury Povich situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have more notes written down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says Maury Povich is what my note says.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it says you will have some regs
and some fems.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see a lot of different
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you basically got two dads in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This plant just basically got knocked up
by two different dads.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get to guess who the baby daddy is
on all the progeny when you grow them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me reread this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure we covered everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure we got it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a female has some desirable
traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reverse it and also use a male donor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I see where we're going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Multiple pawns.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it will receive multiple pawns at
once.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all the seeds are also going to come
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like random seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like just playing a guessing game.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know what did what.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said, if you do want to make
these seeds and do it for fun,
[SPEAKER_01]: have a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't give them away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't sell them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't trade them.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is your Frankenstein for you to play
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not just do it twice?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not just pollinate this plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Make the fem seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do another project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make reg seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be much more strategic and much
more beneficial for the future of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: when we're breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: My theory, my idea is to improve upon the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got plant A and plant B and
they're both eights or nines and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding with two eights or two nines or a
nine and eight, hopefully got two tens.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I understand that's really I don't
even have two tens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm super fucking picky.
[SPEAKER_01]: But hopefully you take two eights or two
nines and you breed them and you come out
[SPEAKER_01]: with a solid nine point five or maybe even
a ten.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you breed two eights together and you
come out with a six or a seven,
[SPEAKER_01]: you done fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did not do us any service.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you did at that point was make seeds
and anybody can make seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when you're Paul and Chuck in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is my public service announcement for
this plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to be a breeder,
the goal is to improve upon the genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my opinion, in my standards,
Maury Povich shit is not considered
[SPEAKER_01]: improving.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if you find something stellar?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a cool plant, but then do you
know what it came from?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got kind of some people care about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: The breeder in me really, really does.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, my dude Shaggy grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got me rambling pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check your inbox and do
check your spam folder because you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: a coupon code for a free pack of seeds
from I read direct dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate that I've got to say this one more
time, but there will be an expiration date
[SPEAKER_01]: on your coupon code.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will be a real expiration date.
[SPEAKER_01]: That coupon will expire at that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will no longer be valid.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll try to use it and it will go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be just like the family feud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve Harvey will be like, can I see
coupon?
[SPEAKER_01]: No coupon, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will not be a coupon.
[SPEAKER_01]: This tells me two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't use your coupon by the time
that it expires, because I give you plenty
[SPEAKER_01]: of time in my opinion, tells me a couple
of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, you didn't check your email.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you got to do is check your email,
check your spam folder.
[SPEAKER_01]: That coupon code will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second, the second thing it tells me when
I read your question on the show,
[SPEAKER_01]: you didn't watch the episode because if
you saw the episode with your question,
[SPEAKER_01]: most people, I'm sure that Shaggy right
now, before he even finished, he pressed
[SPEAKER_01]: pause or he's doing something.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just fucking pulled out the computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, bro, I got free seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's already pulling up the coupon code.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're driving, you get home.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go buy the seeds right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you haven't gotten the coupon code
before it expires, it tells me you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: checking your email, which you should
probably be doing anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also it tells me you didn't even
listen to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why you didn't get the free
seeds because you didn't even listen to
[SPEAKER_01]: the episode where your question was read.
[SPEAKER_01]: I give you most of the time four to six
weeks on those coupon codes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it expires, guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It expired.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to keep this momentum going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got another great question here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came from Frank White.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like a movie character,
Frank White.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope everything's going well for you,
Frank White.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question says, what's up, Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Frank White?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dude, make sure you check your inbox.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check that spam folder because like I
said, you've got a coupon code for a free
[SPEAKER_01]: pack of seeds and I would hate for it to
expire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the question says, first and foremost,
I appreciate what you do for the
[SPEAKER_01]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your show has been a great listen on the
drive to work and while working in the
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that I can help you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm glad I can kill time on the way to
work and in the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I listen to a lot of podcasts,
so I know exactly what you mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad I can give that back to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I've got two questions for you
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, my dude, I'm only going to send you
one coupon code, but I will read both of
[SPEAKER_01]: your questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one says, how do you feel about
collaborating with other breeders?
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally understand testing, quality
control, selection preferences,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera, can make things complicated,
but I was hoping to get your opinion on
[SPEAKER_01]: the topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Collabs with other breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of us breeders are very picky.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of us breeders are very,
I can't even think of the word I'm trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to say, meticulous.
[SPEAKER_01]: The word's in that vein.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like to do things our way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of us don't play well with others.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to play well with others.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try, but we're very, we're breeders for
a reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of us came from this background
before everything was legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of us are criminals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of us are, we come from criminal
background.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are more used to and more familiar kind
of hiding in the shadows and doing this
[SPEAKER_01]: shit on our own, because back in the day,
you couldn't tell anybody what you were
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I told people back in the day that I
was growing ganja, they would either rob
[SPEAKER_01]: me or snitch on me or some shit would go
wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to keep it on the down low.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also that is part of what traumatized
a lot of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are, a lot of us old school growers and
breeders are a little bit broken.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're used to looking over our shoulder.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're used to worrying about shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're used to not trusting anybody because
that's how it used to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's unhealthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go to fucking therapy now to try to fix
that shit, to be honest with you,
[SPEAKER_01]: but a lot of us are a little bit broken
because we've been doing illegal activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to trust people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to have good friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to build real relationships when
you're looking over your shoulder and
[SPEAKER_01]: worried about your best friend,
maybe trying to rob you, steal from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, a lot of us come from that
background.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of us know the risks.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of us have made, a lot of the
breeders have made good friends because we
[SPEAKER_01]: all come from the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We understand that history of our lives,
but a lot of us don't play well with
[SPEAKER_01]: others.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little bit easier to just do it
by yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there are several breeders out there
that I would love to collab with and I
[SPEAKER_01]: know that we would work well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Jinx Proof.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to work with Jinx.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Brad from Raw.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jinx and Raw Brad are the first two I
think of when it comes to doing a collab,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we've talked about it and it never
comes to fruition.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not blaming them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not blaming me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're busy fucking people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing our own thing and to get two
breeders on the same schedule with the
[SPEAKER_01]: same idea to make a plan, that's a whole
nother ball games for us to line up and
[SPEAKER_01]: we're already kind of doing our thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jinx has a family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jinx is doing things where for autism
awareness, Rose and Jinx stay super busy
[SPEAKER_01]: with Jinxy Jr. I'd love to work with them
when the time is right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a busy dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my own.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a 21 year old daughter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I host drum circles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do a whole bunch of I got the seed
company that keeps me super busy doing my
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brad's doing his thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no I'm not blaming anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying that the time just hasn't
happened for all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to I would enjoy it, but a lot of
us would rather just stick to ourselves
[SPEAKER_01]: and play on our own.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't play well with others because of
the history.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm maturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm much better at playing with others at
this point, but it just hasn't come to
[SPEAKER_01]: fruition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what does happen is somebody's out
there yelling it already.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably TARDIS yelling at the screen
going, what about forced collabs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost everything a breeder does is a
forced collab.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I take a plant, let's talk about the
cherry paloma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cherry paloma came from Brad at Raw.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess I have collab with Brad from
Raw, even though he doesn't know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the JR token cherry paloma cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody had that cut for a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've taken that cut and I've read it to a
couple of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've read it to something that I
originated and I've read it to some stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that other breeders also have originated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a sense, I am forced collabing with
Brad from Raw.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is some of my stuff bred to several
of or several of my things bred to his
[SPEAKER_01]: cherry paloma.
[SPEAKER_01]: I reversed a couple things at the cherry
paloma, the skunk number one mainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, there's a BC lemon skunk to cherry
paloma.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of great stuff out there
that I've made with the cherry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am forced collabing with Brad from
Raw.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that Brad and I don't have a
thing going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't talk about it or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had that plant and I pollinated it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just makes it easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing my thing, my business,
my sales, my way, and he can do his thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll always be friends because there will
never be a business argument.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one thing that I like with the way
that I just did this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brad wasn't involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not involved in Brad stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I see Brad, it's all friendship.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, hey bro, taste how good this weed
smokes and taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smell how good this jar smells.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like, hey, do you have the money
for those seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that shit sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is business that gets in the way of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's part of why I don't like to work
with other breeders because money fucks up
[SPEAKER_01]: friendships.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll always be friends with Jinx if we
don't ever collab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll always be friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess I put them in the friend zone
is what I'm technically saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all in each other's friend zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way we get to stay friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather have friends than money at this
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Business is going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Friendships are blooming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's not mix the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't shit where you eat is also another
phrase that they say.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that I don't trust these guys to
do business.
[SPEAKER_01]: With them, it's just easier if we don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the time has never come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I trust those two dudes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The three of us would never fuck each
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could all leave a pile of money on the
table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody would rip each other off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just using examples and being
hypothetical here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's part of why I don't collab with
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Problems come up every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen so many friends lose
relationships and friends just over weird
[SPEAKER_01]: weed shit that was unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this weird business idea didn't happen,
this group of friends and this group of
[SPEAKER_01]: friends would still be friends and they'd
be a fucking powerhouse instead of two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Small groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd be one fucking super group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, I've rambled on enough about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on to part two.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a part two of this question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, are there any plans to restock
Jack the Ripper on I redirect?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully I can grab a few packs if so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently at this time, unfortunately,
I do not have plans to restock any more of
[SPEAKER_01]: the Jack the Ripper stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the Jack the Ripper male,
but kind of go in a different direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really focused on feminized seeds
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fems are, I used to say 70% of the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fems are 85 or 90% of the market right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regular seeds are not selling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I made more regs, they would sit on
the shelf or they would be sold at a
[SPEAKER_01]: blowout price.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really not worth it at this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love making reg seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love breeding regular plants,
but right now the Jack the Ripper is not
[SPEAKER_01]: in the lineup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm currently working with some fem stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next run is Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm making a bunch of Golden Goat reversal
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: There might be a Gary Payton in that run.
[SPEAKER_01]: There might be a GMO root beer in that
run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And who knows what else there might be
getting crossed to the Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then following that, I'm not sure how much
I've talked about this, but excuse me for
[SPEAKER_01]: burping, not even going to edit this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recently I found and discovered in a close
friend's grow, a phenotype of the cream
[SPEAKER_01]: that has got all of the traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nine out of 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got everything you could imagine for
a breeding plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a female, but I'm going to reverse
that cream and pollinate everything in my
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking lineup with that bad girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there will be some Golden Goat crosses,
some new Golden Goat stuff coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then shortly after that, we will have some
cream crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those plants are in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they're getting big enough to get the
clones and get everybody going.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is what's coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no Jack the Ripper for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going to focus on fems, Golden Goat,
then the cream, then maybe more blueberry
[SPEAKER_01]: cookie stuff, just depending on how my
creative juices are flowing at the time
[SPEAKER_01]: and what pops up between now and then.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my buddy, Frank Wyatt, I feel like I
rambled a lot on this answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't work with other breeders just
because of time and planning.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's somebody out there that does
want to do a collab, let's work on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also I like the idea that if you don't
work with your friends, you can never
[SPEAKER_01]: break up with your friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all in the friend zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: We keep business, business and friendship,
friendship.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to keep moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got time for one more good question
here on today's podcast.

[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's stay focused.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting goofy today.
[SPEAKER_01]: The message from my new friend,
Mo says, Hey Rasta Jeff, I love your
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast and the genetics you put out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, that's pretty awesome and ironic
because guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a coupon code for a free pack
of seeds from iREDirect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check your inbox,
check that spam folder and when you grow
[SPEAKER_01]: those seeds, please send me pictures and
make me proud.
[SPEAKER_01]: But wait, there's more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, thank you for making me a better
grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, you are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That stuff means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is like pouring nutrients and
recharge on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it does go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I know you like to finish your
plants the last 10 days on an 18 and six
[SPEAKER_01]: light cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: Many people may be new to the show,
so let me address what this person just
[SPEAKER_01]: said.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I am finishing my plants the last 10
days of the flowering cycle, I will put my
[SPEAKER_01]: lights back on 18 hours on and six hours
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're on 1212.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I will put those lights on 18 hours on
and six hours off.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last 10 days, I increased my lights by
six hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many people's heads just fucking exploded.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're saying, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing this for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple of caveats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me explain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not do this on the first run of a
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do this when you know how long a plant
takes to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you know how long that plant usually
takes to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it takes 70 days, start this at day 60.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the plant takes 80 days, start at day
70.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do this on the first run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Figure out how long the plant takes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the second and third runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when we're going to mess with the
light cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: The last 10 days, it's real easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go from 1212 to 18 hours on and six
hours off.
[SPEAKER_01]: People, their heads are just blowing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it is in my opinion, my experience
that photons, that light is the number one
[SPEAKER_01]: source of energy for our plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Light is what makes the plants grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we put that light on for more hours per
day, they will get more light,
[SPEAKER_01]: which means they will get more
photosynthesis, which means they will be
[SPEAKER_01]: more productive, which means they will get
beefier, more dense, and they will finish
[SPEAKER_01]: sooner.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may be able to turn that light off in
day seven and cut down your entire grow
[SPEAKER_01]: three days earlier than you had
anticipated, because think about it
[SPEAKER_01]: scientifically, you're giving your plant a
half of day more light every single day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may be able to cut off a quarter of a
day every day that that happens just by
[SPEAKER_01]: the DLI that that plant is receiving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, many people think that I'm crazy
because I teach this method, but guess
[SPEAKER_01]: what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody that has tried it has messaged
me and been like, bro, this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only people that don't like this idea
are the people who have not tried it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep that in mind when you're typing
your hate mail right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you haven't tried it, I don't care what
your opinion is, try it, then send me some
[SPEAKER_01]: hate mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, now let's continue with this
message because there is more to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I know you like to finish your
plants on that last 10 days on an 18-6
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am currently crossing some strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you recommend to switch from 12-12
to 18-6 to make the seeds finish more
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly?
[SPEAKER_01]: My quick answer off of the top of my head
without any hesitation is yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's exactly why and how I learned this
method.
[SPEAKER_01]: I realized that the seeds like a lot of
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm growing for seed, I don't care
what the plants look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need pretty buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody is ever going to see the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's ever going to smoke the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all going to get ground up into dust
and the seeds are going to get pulled out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll never know what the herb looks
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do turn my lights back to 18-6 after
pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll explain briefly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me try that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even going to edit that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try that sentence once again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will explain briefly how I do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plants are ready for pollination,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll just hypothetically say it's
pollination time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ta-da, pollinate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I will wait three to five,
maybe seven days, depending on the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll wait a few days, about a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pollinate all over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take that male plant, dust everything or
the reversed female, whatever you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody just got pollinated a second
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I will get rid of that male of that
pollen donor plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have just got pollinated females in the
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will wait until I see those pistols
start to turn brown and wither up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is when I put that light back on 18
hours on and six off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually two to three, maybe five days
after second pollination is when I turn
[SPEAKER_01]: those lights back to 18-6.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now people are going, what are you doing,
dude?
[SPEAKER_01]: 18-6, they're going to revege.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they will, but I don't give a shit
because I'm not growing for buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: These plants are fully seeded.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to make amazing seeds,
big fat healthy seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you guys buy seeds from me and you
get those big fat healthy seeds that are
[SPEAKER_01]: the size of pebbles, those were grown
under an 18-6 light cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I strongly believe that it's because
of all of that extra light.
[SPEAKER_01]: That light gives the plants extra energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That extra energy gives them more
photosynthesis, lets them get bigger,
[SPEAKER_01]: beefier, stronger, faster and earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you do this, you may be able to
harvest your seeds a little bit early.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I will recommend is pay
attention because if you let them go too
[SPEAKER_01]: long like this, they will get too hard and
you will get germination issues if you let
[SPEAKER_01]: them go too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're good and I experienced it
growing for seed, I'm sure you know how to
[SPEAKER_01]: pull a couple of seeds out of a calyx.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it a squeeze and see if it's ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just do not let them go too long is my
main bit of advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, I definitely do recommend
switching back to 18 hours on and six
[SPEAKER_01]: hours off after the second successful
pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will notice that your plants finish
more quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll notice those seeds get big and
beefy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also here is an advantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: If perhaps you forgot to get a clone of
one of those plants, have no fear because
[SPEAKER_01]: they are going to revege before the seeds
are done.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will have plants that look like total
dog shit with big revege shoots sticking
[SPEAKER_01]: out of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can clone that revege, put that in the
cloner and start brand new all over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get clones and seeds and
revege from the same freaking plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's magical.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, my dude Moe, thank you for the
great question.
