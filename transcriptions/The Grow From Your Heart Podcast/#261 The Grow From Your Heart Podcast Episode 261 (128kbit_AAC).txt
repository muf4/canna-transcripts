[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see what else I have to say?
[SPEAKER_10]: I have 22 East Bijou in lovely downtown
Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_10]: While you're down there, stop at Bambino's
and get yourself a pizza.
[SPEAKER_10]: You will love it.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a big shout out to my friends in
the Colorado podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you listened to the last episode,
episode number 136, that was what I call a
[SPEAKER_10]: swap cast.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's also known as a crossover episode.
[SPEAKER_10]: I had my friends from the Colorado podcast
come by and they hung out for about two
[SPEAKER_10]: hours and re-recorded a ridiculous
podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: Big shout out to Jesse Grosz.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to Despicable D and also a huge
shout out to my buddy 44.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you guys for coming and recording
this show.
[SPEAKER_10]: Make sure you guys support the Colorado
podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you haven't listened to that one yet,
make sure you go back and listen to 136.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's all the ads and information
I have got to start the show.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to talk about a message I received
from a listener.
[SPEAKER_10]: He was talking about wondering if CBD
derived from hemp is any good if it is the
[SPEAKER_10]: same as CBD derived from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: He was thinking that hemp derived CBD
would not have any medicinal value.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm here to clear that up.
[SPEAKER_10]: That is inaccurate.
[SPEAKER_10]: CBD derived from hemp and CBD derived from
cannabis is the same CBD.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're pulling out the same CBD.
[SPEAKER_10]: The main difference between hemp and
cannabis is the amount of THC.
[SPEAKER_10]: The state of Colorado has set a threshold
of how much THC is allowed to be in your
[SPEAKER_10]: plants before they are considered hemp or
THC.
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly, I do not remember the exact
ratio.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's 5% THC.
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be 0.5% THC.
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be three.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's somewhere between 3% and 5% THC to
the best of my knowledge.
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's got more than that, it is
considered cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's got less than that, it is
considered a hemp plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: Our friends over at Sansol, a giant CBD
farm or a giant hemp farm here in Pueblo,
[SPEAKER_10]: Colorado, produce massive amounts of CBD
product from their hemp farm.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you were confused, if you were thinking
that CBD derived from hemp versus CBD
[SPEAKER_10]: derived from cannabis is a different
product, ladies and gentlemen,
[SPEAKER_10]: that is the same molecule.
[SPEAKER_10]: It will have the same medicinal benefits.
[SPEAKER_10]: It will do the same thing for you.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you took what was considered a hemp
plant that was high in CBD and a cannabis
[SPEAKER_10]: plant that was high in THC and you ran
them both through the exact same
[SPEAKER_10]: extraction method, whether it be BHO or
CO2, you would pull out very similar
[SPEAKER_10]: products, very similar concentrates,
but the hemp product is going to be very
[SPEAKER_10]: high in CBD and it will not contain any
THC or very, very trace amounts if any at
[SPEAKER_10]: all.
[SPEAKER_10]: The only difference is the source and the
main difference of the source is just the
[SPEAKER_10]: lack of THC.
[SPEAKER_10]: I pressed pause and I did a little bit of
research.
[SPEAKER_10]: In the state of Colorado, the difference
between hemp and cannabis, if a plant
[SPEAKER_10]: contains greater than 0.3% THC,
it is considered a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: It cannot qualify to be on a hemp farm.
[SPEAKER_10]: That is the threshold there is 0.3% THC.
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's got more than 0.3, it cannot be
grown on a hemp farm.
[SPEAKER_10]: It must be then grown in a medical
marijuana or a recreational marijuana
[SPEAKER_10]: cultivation facility that is regulated by
the MED, which is a totally different
[SPEAKER_10]: ballgame than growing hemp.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're able to produce large amounts of CBD
products now because we're using hemp
[SPEAKER_10]: farms to do so, which is making CBD
medicine available to many more people.
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope that clears that up for you.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to move forward.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for the email.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got another email.
[SPEAKER_10]: This one came from another listener.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to say, if you send me an
email and you want your name set on the
[SPEAKER_10]: air, include that in your email because I
try to be respectful and not bust out
[SPEAKER_10]: people's names.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what state you're in.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know where you work.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what you do.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to get you in trouble by
saying your name on the show.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you'd like me to say your name,
just let me know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's an email.
[SPEAKER_10]: This one says, hey, Rasta Jeff,
thanks for putting out such a quality
[SPEAKER_10]: show.
[SPEAKER_10]: First of all, you're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for the compliment.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: That gives me the motivation to keep this
show coming at you every week.
[SPEAKER_10]: It takes a lot of effort to do a weekly
podcast when you work as much as I do.
[SPEAKER_10]: These compliments and the words of
affirmation, is that what that's called?
[SPEAKER_10]: The compliments and words of affirmation
are definitely keeping me moving strong.
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then the email goes on to say,
I'm looking forward to your upcoming
[SPEAKER_10]: outdoor show you mentioned is in the
works.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm wondering if you can discuss strains
that do particularly well outdoors.
[SPEAKER_10]: I am trying to get more outdoor episodes
for you.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's hard to get Jesse here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Jesse is busy with his own podcast,
his own gardens, his own business,
[SPEAKER_10]: but when Jesse's free, I will get him here
for more outdoor stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: This guy says, I'm growing an organ
outdoors again this year.
[SPEAKER_10]: When researching strains online,
I couldn't find much information on which
[SPEAKER_10]: do better indoors and out.
[SPEAKER_10]: I ended up picking clones of Blue Dream,
Green Crack, Sunset Sherbet, and Gorilla
[SPEAKER_10]: Glue 4.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've read that Blue Dream does
phenomenally outdoors, but couldn't find
[SPEAKER_10]: much on the rest.
[SPEAKER_10]: I looked at past Emerald Cup winners to
see what has won there since those grows
[SPEAKER_10]: are outdoors, but I couldn't find many of
those strains locally.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm interested in PM resistant strains as
well, since that's something we battle
[SPEAKER_10]: come fall.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's more to the email, but I took a
screenshot and I didn't get the rest of it
[SPEAKER_10]: in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate you sending me that email.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's talk about a few strains that I
think would do very well for you outdoors.
[SPEAKER_10]: First of all, I could recommend almost
anything from DJ Short.
[SPEAKER_10]: DJ Short's Flow and Blueberry do
wonderfully outdoors.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those strains are very mold resistant.
[SPEAKER_10]: They finish kind of early and they will
give you nice heavy harvest outdoors.
[SPEAKER_10]: Something you want to keep in mind for an
outdoor garden is you need stuff that is
[SPEAKER_10]: going to finish kind of early.
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't want it to take a super long
time.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got to get it done before the fall or
the winter comes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe out there in Oregon you have more
time than we do here in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_10]: so you have maybe a little longer window.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe you might be able to get something
like some Sour Diesel or some Chem Dog.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those strains do very well outdoors.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're very mold resistant.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to want to stick with strains
that finish around 60 days.
[SPEAKER_10]: About eight weeks, strains would be ideal
for you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Something like from my lineup,
I would recommend Capelton for outdoor
[SPEAKER_10]: strains that finish on time and puts on
nice resin.
[SPEAKER_10]: It loves the sunshine.
[SPEAKER_10]: When you grow it in soil, add plenty of
kelp products.
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll make it taste nice and funky,
nice and earthy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Capelton is very mold resistant.
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you can get it finished in time,
Golden Goat will take about 65 to 70 days
[SPEAKER_10]: to reach full maturity outdoors.
[SPEAKER_10]: But outdoor Golden Goat is amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Golden Goat loves that sunshine and it
will harvest super heavily.
[SPEAKER_10]: Another strain I can recommend for great
outdoor growing is Old School Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hindu Kush finishes on time and it really
loves to be grown in an outdoor
[SPEAKER_10]: environment.
[SPEAKER_10]: We had some wonderful Hindu Kush going
through our area a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: I knew the grower.
[SPEAKER_10]: He said he never had problems with mildew.
[SPEAKER_10]: The bugs didn't like the Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a wonderful plant for outdoors.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are some great outdoor strains that
we can recommend.
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like you've already chosen your
strains because you had to rely on clones
[SPEAKER_10]: that were available in your area.
[SPEAKER_10]: The Blue Dream should do all right
outside.
[SPEAKER_10]: It should produce really heavy if it gets
finished on time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Green Crack, I don't have a lot of
experience with.
[SPEAKER_10]: The Sunset Sherbet, I don't have a lot of
experience there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Gorilla Glue 4, that is a hardy plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: It will grow like a beast outside.
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope everything finishes up on time.
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope your outdoor harvest goes perfectly
for you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I thank you for the email and I hope we
answered your question.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, I do have another email.
[SPEAKER_10]: This one, if I can pull it up on the phone
here.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, this one comes from one of our
friends on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he says, Hey Rasta Jeff, I have a
quick question that I feel you can easily
[SPEAKER_10]: shed some light upon.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, words are hard today, you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: He says, I've started my outdoor crop
early indoors under a 400 watt metal
[SPEAKER_10]: halide and July 1st is my outside plant
day.
[SPEAKER_10]: And currently my plants are on a 24 hour
cycle.
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel I should 18 six to start
acclimating them to get ready for the
[SPEAKER_10]: outdoors soon.
[SPEAKER_10]: Any thoughts on this subject?
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate your time.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you're a busy man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sincerely, a long time podcast listener.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then he signs with his name.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, dude, I don't know if you want me to
say your name, but he's asking if he he's
[SPEAKER_10]: growing his plants indoors and he's
getting them started so that he can put
[SPEAKER_10]: them outside July 1st.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he's asking so far he's got them under
a 24 hour light cycle.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he's asking if he should adjust his
light schedule to 18 six to get them ready
[SPEAKER_10]: for the outdoor sun schedule.
[SPEAKER_10]: That is a really good question.
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel like I'm talking really fast.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm going to press pause for a minute.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to take a couple of fat dabs and
a drink and I will be right back and we
[SPEAKER_10]: will talk about this.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, I am back.
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel like I had enough dabs to kind of
override all of the caffeine I've had
[SPEAKER_10]: today.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just took some fat dabs of lemon G grown
by myself at the Green and Healthy
[SPEAKER_10]: Wellness Garden, extracted by our good
friends at Turpex and available on the
[SPEAKER_10]: shelves at Green and Healthy Wellness in
Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Since I'm talking about Green and Healthy
Wellness, I want to do two quick shout
[SPEAKER_10]: outs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Huge shout out to John Randall Jr. That
dude has been trimming his ass off.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ladies and gentlemen, if you shop at Green
and Healthy Wellness, most of the flowers
[SPEAKER_10]: there are trimmed by our friend Randall's.
[SPEAKER_10]: So make sure you follow Randall's on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's at nugtendo.
[SPEAKER_10]: Give him a shout out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let him know that you appreciate the way
he is trimming the flowers.
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, I owe a huge shout out to my new
friend, Zach.
[SPEAKER_10]: Zach is helping out in the garden.
[SPEAKER_10]: Zach, you were killing it, my friend.
[SPEAKER_10]: I took a day off and I came back and all
of the plants were still alive.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I am impressed.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks a lot, brother.
[SPEAKER_10]: I should mention that Green and Healthy
Wellness is a medical cannabis only
[SPEAKER_10]: facility.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Colorado Springs does not allow any
recreational cannabis sales.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you'd like to shop with us,
you do need your purple medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_10]: card.
[SPEAKER_10]: Drop in and see us.
[SPEAKER_10]: Green and Healthy Wellness, 430 West
Colorado Avenue.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'd love to help you out with all of your
medical cannabis needs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Also check us out in Denver.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're called Nugs 303.
[SPEAKER_10]: Once again, a medical only facility.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'd love to help you out.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys, let's get back to this listener
email.
[SPEAKER_10]: Our listener was asking about putting his
plants outdoors.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's had them on a 24 hour light cycle.
[SPEAKER_10]: He wants to know if he should adjust his
lights to an 18 six photo period before
[SPEAKER_10]: taking them outside.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I sent Jesse a message and I
asked him what he thought about this
[SPEAKER_10]: because I had my own idea.
[SPEAKER_10]: Jesse and I have two different ideas on
this.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think both of these ideas are going to
work.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me say this before I get too far into
this.
[SPEAKER_10]: No matter what you do, I recommend that
you take these plants outside and put them
[SPEAKER_10]: in the sun for maybe two hours on the
first day and then bring them back inside
[SPEAKER_10]: and then take them outside and put them in
the sun for maybe two and a half to three
[SPEAKER_10]: hours the next day.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then bring them back inside and then
take them back outside and just give them
[SPEAKER_10]: like, you know, maybe 30 to another hour
every day of sunlight so they can get used
[SPEAKER_10]: to that sun.
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe by about the seventh to 10th
day, you can just leave them out there and
[SPEAKER_10]: they'll be cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think you should slowly adjust them
to the sun or they're good.
[SPEAKER_10]: They might get fried if they're,
if they're not super hardy plants,
[SPEAKER_10]: that sun might kick their ass.
[SPEAKER_10]: So keep that in mind, slowly introduce
them to the sun.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause if you just put them out there,
they're going to get a sunburn and kind of
[SPEAKER_10]: freak out.
[SPEAKER_10]: So think about that.
[SPEAKER_10]: My opinion about your light cycle was that
you should just leave your lights on 24
[SPEAKER_10]: hours and then start taking the plants out
and get them adjusted.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then once you take them outside,
once you're permanently out there,
[SPEAKER_10]: if you have them in pots and you're going
to leave them out there, or if you put
[SPEAKER_10]: them in the ground, once they're out there
forever, it will only take a few days for
[SPEAKER_10]: them to adjust to the sun's natural photo
period.
[SPEAKER_10]: The sun is much more intense than the
light that you have in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_10]: It will, it will train those plants what
to do.
[SPEAKER_10]: There are specific spectrums that the sun
puts off at sunrise and sunset that
[SPEAKER_10]: trigger hormones inside your plant that
tell it when to go to sleep and when to
[SPEAKER_10]: wake up.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the sun will start programming your
plant when to wake up and when to sleep
[SPEAKER_10]: very quickly.
[SPEAKER_10]: It won't take very long for your plant to
adjust to that.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you leave your grow lights on 24 seven,
then you take it outside and you throw it
[SPEAKER_10]: in that sun, on that normal cycle,
it may start to flower.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the only downfall to that.
[SPEAKER_10]: It may start to auto flower a little bit
early and then it'll go back into veg and
[SPEAKER_10]: then it will flower at the appropriate
time.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that may be an issue if you have a
plant that has a very, very sensitive
[SPEAKER_10]: photo period.
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be the only downfall to that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what Jesse said to do was to try to
match the schedule of the sun with the
[SPEAKER_10]: schedule of your grow lights.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to be a little bit
challenging because like I said,
[SPEAKER_10]: the time that the news or your farmer's
almanac are going to say that the sun is
[SPEAKER_10]: going to rise and set, that is those times
in those books and on the news are
[SPEAKER_10]: accurate.
[SPEAKER_10]: But when do the far red and near red
spectrums of the sun start shining onto
[SPEAKER_10]: your plants outside?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's hard to figure that out exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're going to want to try to match
the sun, rise and sunset as best you can
[SPEAKER_10]: to get those plants on sort of a schedule.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think that you'd be just fine if you
ran that 24 hour light cycle and slowly
[SPEAKER_10]: introduce your plants to the sun.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's called hardening them off.
[SPEAKER_10]: Get them nice and stable.
[SPEAKER_10]: Put them in their forever homes and then
just let the sun work its magic and put
[SPEAKER_10]: those plants into its schedule.
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be my guidance.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you have the time and the energy,
do some research, find out what time the
[SPEAKER_10]: sun will be setting and rising for about a
week, and then start adjusting your timers
[SPEAKER_10]: every day to that schedule and get your
sunrise and sunset times matched up
[SPEAKER_10]: exactly to the outside time with the sun.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then start putting your plants
outside, harden them off and get them on
[SPEAKER_10]: that schedule.
[SPEAKER_10]: And by the time they're outside
permanently, have them adjusted to that
[SPEAKER_10]: schedule.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you have the time and the energy to
research it and make that happen,
[SPEAKER_10]: do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you don't have the energy and the time
for that, run it 24-7 and throw them out
[SPEAKER_10]: there.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're running some indicas,
you'll be just fine.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're running some sativas,
they may start to flower on you a little
[SPEAKER_10]: bit early.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of those sativas will flower a little
bit sooner because just a slight change in
[SPEAKER_10]: photo period is all they get in their
natural habitat.
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're going to trigger flowering with
just a little bit of a variation in photo
[SPEAKER_10]: period.
[SPEAKER_10]: So pay attention to your plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you do notice that your plants are
starting to flower a little bit too early
[SPEAKER_10]: in the season, one good way to stop that
from happening or to make sure that it
[SPEAKER_10]: doesn't happen is to get a light and get a
long extension cord and just carry a light
[SPEAKER_10]: outside and shine it over all of those
plants about three hours after the sun
[SPEAKER_10]: goes down.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that will keep those plants awake and
it won't let them turn into their
[SPEAKER_10]: flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's one way you can make sure that
they don't flower too early.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you do see them starting to flower
a little bit early, that's one way to kind
[SPEAKER_10]: of revert and prevent this from happening.
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't matter what kind of light you
use and it doesn't have to be really super
[SPEAKER_10]: intense.
[SPEAKER_10]: As long as you just get out there for a
few minutes and shine it over each plant,
[SPEAKER_10]: you'll wake them up.
[SPEAKER_10]: They won't start sleeping.
[SPEAKER_10]: They won't get enough sleep to go into
their flowering period.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can kind of extend your veg phase.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I hope that helped you make a decision
on how you're going to handle your
[SPEAKER_10]: adjustment.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just make sure you introduce the plants to
the sunshine kind of slowly, because if
[SPEAKER_10]: they're small plants, if they're not
really healthy, that sun will kick their
[SPEAKER_10]: ass.
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, if you've got more plants inside,
if you're taking some plants outside and
[SPEAKER_10]: then bringing them back, if you do leave
plants inside for an indoor grow,
[SPEAKER_10]: make sure you treat those because there's
a good likelihood that you will bring
[SPEAKER_10]: outdoor pests into your indoor garden and
cause a problem there.
[SPEAKER_10]: So be careful with that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And also, here's guidance for anybody with
two gardens.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you've got an indoor and an outdoor
garden, if you're growing cannabis in more
[SPEAKER_10]: than one location, if you've got two
indoor gardens, try to change clothes and
[SPEAKER_10]: shoes before you go from one garden to the
other, especially your outdoor and indoor
[SPEAKER_10]: garden.
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't want to run from the outdoor
garden to your indoor garden in the same
[SPEAKER_10]: shoes and the same pants and the same
shirt and the same hat.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a good idea to change clothes if you
can.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know it's not always possible,
but try to kick off your shoes,
[SPEAKER_10]: change your pants, change your t-shirt,
put on a different hat.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you've got dreadlocks like me,
put up your dreads in a different hat.
[SPEAKER_10]: You just don't want to drag problems from
one garden to the other.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you've got powdery mildew, if you've
got spider mites, your shoes, your hat,
[SPEAKER_10]: your clothes, it's the greatest way to
move those bugs around.
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll just introduce problems to every
garden you go to.
[SPEAKER_10]: Try to keep in mind when you're moving
from one place to another, if you're going
[SPEAKER_10]: from your garden to your friend's garden
to another person's garden, just keep in
[SPEAKER_10]: mind you're just spreading garden STDs
everywhere you go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep a change of clothes in your car if
you're that kind of person.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do what you can to stop spreading spider
mites and powdery mildew through cannabis
[SPEAKER_10]: industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my guidance.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's enough listener emails for today.
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate everybody that sends me
messages.
[SPEAKER_10]: Please send me messages at
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would love to get messages from you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would love to hear your questions.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like making content that is aimed at
listeners.
[SPEAKER_10]: That way I know that I'm giving you what
you want and what you need.
[SPEAKER_10]: Makes it easy for both of us.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to give a huge shout out to a
product.
[SPEAKER_10]: This company does not pay me, or at least
not yet.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe they will after they hear this,
but this is just a genuine product
[SPEAKER_10]: endorsement.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys, I can highly recommend a product
called Big Time Exterminator.
[SPEAKER_10]: Big Time Exterminator will get rid of your
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_10]: I used it for a patient of mine who's got
a small garden, an elderly gentleman who
[SPEAKER_10]: needs a lot of help.
[SPEAKER_10]: He had a powdery mildew issue and Big Time
Exterminator seems to have gotten rid of
[SPEAKER_10]: his powdery mildew issue.
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, it got rid of white flies in another
garden.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've not seen a white fly.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've not seen a spider mite.
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't seen a fungus net.
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems like Big Time Exterminator is
doing a very good job at getting rid of a
[SPEAKER_10]: lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's also approved by the Colorado MED,
so it is allowed to be used in commercial
[SPEAKER_10]: applications.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to Big Time Exterminator.
[SPEAKER_10]: Somehow let those guys know that I am
endorsing their product for free,
[SPEAKER_10]: just because it works.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen it work and I approve of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Great product, you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go find yourself some of that if you've
got some powdery mildew or spider mites,
[SPEAKER_10]: or just use it as a preventative.
[SPEAKER_10]: It will definitely work for you.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's enough product endorsements.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got another episode coming up pretty
soon for my friend, Fred.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fred asked about harvesting a seed crop.
[SPEAKER_10]: He has done his first breeding project.

[SPEAKER_10]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_10]: My friends call me Ross and Jeff.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to thank you guys again for joining

[SPEAKER_10]: I had a great time.
[SPEAKER_10]: I danced my ass off.
[SPEAKER_10]: I sang my ass off.
[SPEAKER_10]: The Mystic Roots band came out and they

[SPEAKER_10]: There may have been some ganja smoking and
nobody tried to stop us.
[SPEAKER_10]: So much love and respect to the Black
Sheep in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Big shout out to the bands.
[SPEAKER_10]: Big shout out to Catchafia.
[SPEAKER_10]: They came all the way from New Zealand to
play in the States.
[SPEAKER_10]: That band is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: I had a good time checking those guys out,
but I really had a good time getting down
[SPEAKER_10]: to the Mystic Roots.
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope I saw you there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope we got a high five together.
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope we got a dab.
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope we got to shake your hand.
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope we saw each other and had a great

[SPEAKER_10]: Big shout out to Smiles and the crew.
[SPEAKER_10]: Big shout out to Jessica.
[SPEAKER_10]: All the wooks that I hung out with.
[SPEAKER_10]: I had a great time with you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: In this podcast, I have my friend Will,
the barefoot grower over.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we also had Rob from Sour Seeds over
and we talked a whole bunch about
[SPEAKER_10]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_10]: My friend Fred Garvin sent me an email and
he asked about harvesting his first seed
[SPEAKER_10]: crop.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fred is halfway through his first breeding
project and he wanted a little bit of
[SPEAKER_10]: guidance on how to properly take down his
seeded plants, how to get the seeds out of
[SPEAKER_10]: there, how to store them and how to care
for them.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to give a long discussion
on pulling the seeds out of your seeded
[SPEAKER_10]: plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: Before we get that far, you guys,
I want to give a huge shout out to my
[SPEAKER_10]: friends at Elevate Glass in Colorado
Springs.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you need a new rig, if you need a new
nail, if you need a new dabber,
[SPEAKER_10]: if you're trying to buy a brand new
e-nail, you can check out my friends at
[SPEAKER_10]: Elevate Glass.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're located at 517 South Cajon in
beautiful Colorado Springs, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_10]: Make sure you let them know Ross and Jeff
sent you and let them know that you're
[SPEAKER_10]: listening to the growth from your heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: You would both appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So make sure you check out Elevate Glass,
517 South Cajon in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys, I'm going to let this music play
for a couple of seconds.
[SPEAKER_10]: And when we get back, we will be joined by
the Barefoot Grower and Rob from Sour
[SPEAKER_10]: Seeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Podcast World, we are back.
[SPEAKER_10]: Joining me at the table is my good buddy,
Will, also known as the Barefoot Grower.
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome to the table, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's going on, man?
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, are you still blowing glass?
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, kind of had to put that on
hiatus for a while.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just curious.
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw you change from Barefoot Blower or
glass.
[SPEAKER_10]: Barefoot Glass to Barefoot Grower.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's another podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a whole different type of podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome to the show, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for having me, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Also across the table from me is my good
buddy, Rob from Sour Seeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you doing today, bro?
[SPEAKER_10]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_10]: Good to be back.
[SPEAKER_10]: Man, we got Rob a little bit too high.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's got a funny look on his face,
but I think he's going to be all right in
[SPEAKER_10]: a minute.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got that Bill Cosby grin.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you might be the Barefoot Blower.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're off to a good start.
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you say to that?
[SPEAKER_10]: This is not going to turn into the
Colorado podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: I will get this back on the rails very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_10]: So thanks for coming to the table,
guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Both these guys, we've been talking about
how busy we are.
[SPEAKER_10]: We sat here for an hour and talked about
how we don't have time for shit,
[SPEAKER_10]: which is kind of funny if you ask me.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to talk about our friend,
Fred Garvin, sent me an email and he is
[SPEAKER_10]: halfway through a seed breeding project.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is his first run trying to make
seeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: He wants some guidance on how to harvest
the seeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe when to pull the seeds and things to
look for.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I thought, shit, my buddy Rob breeds a
lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: I breed a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll get Rob over to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Will was coming over to hang out and take
some dabs.
[SPEAKER_10]: He brought a dope ass mothership.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I was like, hang out.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll put you on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to talk a little bit about
seed breeding.
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob's got a bunch of notes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there anywhere you'd like to start
with, bro?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you were looking at that thing
pretty intently.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we should start from the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like the moment, the conception basically,
you know, when the seed starts,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, when to pollinate and how to
pollinate like the timing wise Indica
[SPEAKER_13]: versus Sativa.
[SPEAKER_10]: So hopefully you've got yourself a solid
male that we've talked about before.
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, you came and talked about that
with me.
[SPEAKER_10]: So hopefully you've got a solid male.
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got your females chosen.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now it is time to actually breed some
plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you're going to pick some Indica
plants, when should we start to pollinate
[SPEAKER_10]: our Indica plants?
[SPEAKER_13]: I would say between week three and four,
when your bud sets really start to form up
[SPEAKER_13]: for the first time.
[SPEAKER_13]: I would say when they get about,
you know, good nickel to quarter size.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: That way you got plenty of, because what
it's really going to determine down on is
[SPEAKER_13]: how many hairs you have, basically how
many pistols you have.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they're what carry the pollen down.
[SPEAKER_13]: That actually make the progress happen.
[SPEAKER_10]: So when you see the pistols nice and
thick, it kind of looks like you got some
[SPEAKER_10]: little spiders going on.
[SPEAKER_10]: When those dandelions, when the hairs in
the dandelions, I know that's such obvious
[SPEAKER_10]: terms, but when those pistols get thick
and ready, that's when that plant is
[SPEAKER_10]: ovulating and it wants to receive that
male pollen.
[SPEAKER_10]: So in your Indica plants, you're
absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_10]: About three weeks ish, about day 21 to
about day 28 ish, is usually when I try to
[SPEAKER_10]: hit an Indica plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: Indica Domina Hybrid, you can get away
with maybe sometime week four,
[SPEAKER_13]: if it's, you know, bred out with a Sativa
or something like that, has slightly
[SPEAKER_13]: longer flowering time.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, you just really have to use your
best judgment, you know, but typically
[SPEAKER_13]: week three is about the money for it,
in my opinion.
All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: How about if we're working with a more
Sativa dominant plant?
[SPEAKER_13]: You want to go a little bit later,
you think?
[SPEAKER_13]: You do.
[SPEAKER_13]: You really do want to get a little bit
later.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the reason being, cause if you do a
pollination too early, you're not going to
[SPEAKER_13]: get the seed stock you want.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then they also might be sitting in the
plant for too long and the plant might not
[SPEAKER_13]: be ripe, but the seeds will be.
[SPEAKER_13]: Seeds will over ripen just like any fruit
or anything else out there.
[SPEAKER_13]: It can over ripen.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've seen them pop inside the bud before.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've seen all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_10]: You've actually seen a seed germinate
itself inside of a bud.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: But now when you guys say, uh,
Indica and Sativa, you talking about the
[SPEAKER_11]: female you're using or the cross that
you're trying to get?
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, the female that we're starting with.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: The girl that's going to receive the
pollen.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: The girl.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why Will's here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just keep us on track.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a great question.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a great question.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're always, you know, with that word,
we're definitely referring to the female
[SPEAKER_13]: for sure.
Okay.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: See Sativa dominant plants, you can
usually do a week, week four, week five,
[SPEAKER_13]: usually typically a week or two later than
you would an Indica.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, you really have to judge
flowering period.
[SPEAKER_13]: If it's a nine to 10 week Sativa,
you know, you want, you want to leave a,
[SPEAKER_13]: basically what you're leaving and looking
for is about a four to five week gap of
[SPEAKER_13]: just the plants going through growth,
normal, regular solid growth for about
[SPEAKER_13]: four to five weeks.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's going to make that seed go from
start to finish and really finish out
[SPEAKER_13]: nicely from, from start to embryo to seed
to harvest.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've got pollen.
[SPEAKER_10]: When, uh, should we put, should we put our
males and females into the flowering room
[SPEAKER_10]: at the same time?
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I think it really depends on your
situation.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, it's the easiest way to do it.
[SPEAKER_13]: If somebody's worried about, uh,
getting cross pollination with other
[SPEAKER_13]: females and things like that is to bring
the female out of the room or use a
[SPEAKER_13]: smaller room like us, maybe like a small
two by two or three by three grow tent.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've seen people even go down and use
something as cheap as a very large
[SPEAKER_13]: cardboard box, like, like something for a
refrigerator or like the largest box you
[SPEAKER_13]: can get at U-Haul, put a CFL in it for
your males, you know, and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And just let them go and then throw the
female in there just for the day or two.
[SPEAKER_13]: Need to do its thing and pull it back out.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then it's, the deed is done.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let it sit, spray it down with tap water,
introduce it back into the flower room so
[SPEAKER_13]: you don't cross pollinate.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, the way I do it since I am,
when I, when I pollinate, I do the whole
[SPEAKER_10]: room.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even fuck around.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that I'm going to do the entire
room.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll get that male nice and beefy.
[SPEAKER_10]: And when he's full of pollen and hopefully
I've got him timed up to where my girls
[SPEAKER_10]: are about three to four weeks in,
I just take him in there and put them in
[SPEAKER_10]: front of the fan and give them a good
shake, smack the sticks a little bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that pollen goes everywhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everywhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's only if you're trying to do the
whole room.
Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're trying to time it and you don't
know how long your male plant is going to
[SPEAKER_10]: take to start busting a nut.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, that's when it's time to flower him
early and take pollen from him and collect
[SPEAKER_10]: the pollen into a container.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you can apply pollen to the
branches you want, or you can walk in
[SPEAKER_10]: there and hold that jar of pollen in front
of a fan and shake it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, you can kind of salt and pepper
sprinkle the plants if you'd like.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, there are several ways to apply the
pollen.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's exactly how I do it as a breeder.
[SPEAKER_13]: I harvest pollen first.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then choose females secondly.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I always harvest pollen.
[SPEAKER_13]: I keep good storage of pollen.
[SPEAKER_13]: A good way to store pollen is a good
question.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I get asked all the time, how do you
store your pollen?
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I, I just use a very clean container.
[SPEAKER_13]: I wipe it out with alcohol first to let it
dry really good.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then wipe it out with water to make
sure there's no alcohol left.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to kill the pollen.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't use tap water.
[SPEAKER_13]: I use an RO water or distilled water.
[SPEAKER_13]: That way there's no chlorine present.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it won't destroy the pollen.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let it dry real well.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let it dry real well.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can use a dried rice is a really good
thing to use.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I've seen growers use dried rice,
but the main thing is, is when you go to
[SPEAKER_13]: store pollen is to make sure there's no
green material leftover or any kind of bud
[SPEAKER_13]: material or leaf material present in the
pollen.
[SPEAKER_13]: Whenever you're going through there after
harvesting it, cause there's going to be
[SPEAKER_13]: little pieces here and there.
[SPEAKER_13]: And what that's going to do is it's going
to create a moisture spot inside of that
[SPEAKER_13]: pollen and it's going to start molding.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's where you can cause cause water
breeds bacteria.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's basically what it boils down to.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the bacteria is going to take over and
it's going to render your pollen useless.
[SPEAKER_10]: I do a very similar method.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll collect the pollen from the mail and
then I will have a clone of that mail and
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll flower him right alongside my ladies
so that I'm sure that right around the
[SPEAKER_10]: proper day, I know that each of my ladies
will get dusted with the proper amount of
[SPEAKER_10]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm double, double teaming in a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm kind of a weirdo.
[SPEAKER_10]: I might be a cannabis hoarder because I
always like to keep a little bit of
[SPEAKER_10]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like just in case something goes wrong,
I've still got some of that pollen.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I love to do.
[SPEAKER_13]: Keep it back.
[SPEAKER_13]: You never know when you're going to come
across them and say, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: that one male would do really good with
that female.
[SPEAKER_13]: It'd be a new cut that you just gotten ran
for the first time.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you realize, Hey, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_13]: If I would have had that male or if I had
that pollen, I could have just made a
[SPEAKER_13]: masterpiece.
[SPEAKER_13]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I've got that pollen.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like you were saying, keep it in a clean
jar or a container.
[SPEAKER_10]: I keep mine in a clean, those little tiny
mason jars, like a baby food size mason
[SPEAKER_10]: jar.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I keep that in a brown paper bag.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's no light getting to it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I actually put that in my spare
refrigerator right next to my silver
[SPEAKER_10]: thiosulfate solution.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think cold is more preservative than
heat.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think things will deteriorate and
degrade and shit goes wrong more quickly.
[SPEAKER_10]: And heat in nature, uh, cold slows
everything down.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's, you keep your food and your
meats and shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't keep any meat, but I mean,
if you do, you keep that shit in a fridge,
[SPEAKER_10]: keep it cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll keep your pollen viable for longer.
[SPEAKER_10]: I also keep some seeds in a cooler and I
haven't seen any difference in the seeds
[SPEAKER_10]: that I have kept not in a cooler and in a
cooler.
[SPEAKER_10]: My other seeds go in a safe.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got a big gun safe filled with seeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, the seeds that were in the cooler.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've germinated those with the same exact
success rate as non-cooled seeds.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we know when to pollinate the plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, we know it's going to take about,
uh, five to six weeks for those plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: Once the pollination happens, you'll see
the pistols curl up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, right now they'll be clear looking.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're white.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're kind of like clear, veiny white
tips.
[SPEAKER_10]: Once that pollen hits, they're going to
crinkle up like claws, like, like
[SPEAKER_10]: arthritis fingers.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to start turning brown.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, that's how, you know, the pollination
has happened.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now the pollen is moving up the,
uh, up the pistol and into the ovule and
[SPEAKER_10]: you're now actually making a seed.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, let's talk a little bit about what to
feed plants that we're, uh, putting seeds
[SPEAKER_10]: into.
[SPEAKER_13]: I like to give them a lot of carbs.
[SPEAKER_13]: I like to give them a lot of carbs and
sugar, lots of energy and a good little
[SPEAKER_13]: bloom booster.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's, that's about all I really do to
them.
[SPEAKER_13]: Other than that, I do give them a little
extra nitrogen and flour than I normally
[SPEAKER_13]: would because the plant's going to use a
little bit of extra everything.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just like a mom would create a baby inside
of her.
[SPEAKER_13]: She's going to try to, she's going to eat,
she's got to eat too.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you got to take that concept and relay
that into your plan.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, you're, you're creating
thousands of seeds.
[SPEAKER_13]: So those offspring have, they need,
they need nutrients.
[SPEAKER_13]: They need food to be able to grow healthy
and strong, just like a baby would or
[SPEAKER_13]: anything else would.
[SPEAKER_13]: So completely use as much light as
possible when you're breeding light is
[SPEAKER_10]: definitely helpful.
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll multiply your amounts of seeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you step up, step up from a 400 to a
600 to a thousand, you'll see the amount
[SPEAKER_10]: of seed you produce and the quality of the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those little white seeds won't happen if
you use a thousand.
[SPEAKER_10]: You only get those with a four or a six.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually use sixes.
[SPEAKER_10]: I do a 1212 regimen when I'm, when I go
into flower for a breeding project.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I actually, I use 600s, but even like
you were saying, it will help mature
[SPEAKER_13]: faster with a brighter light source or
hotter light source.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so typically what I do like this time
of year, I take them and put them outside
[SPEAKER_13]: for the last week to ripen, let the UV
rays really taken over and not only does
[SPEAKER_13]: it increase the THC and bombard the plant
at all at one time, it really,
[SPEAKER_13]: it really looks good on the charts after
it's cut down.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's something about making oil out of
plants that were seeded once those plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll talk about this in a minute,
but once the plants are finished,
[SPEAKER_10]: you take the seeds out and you've got a
bunch of material left.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like to take that material to one of my
good friends like Will that makes hash for
[SPEAKER_10]: me and the concentrates that come out of
that, you get such an amazing high.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's some, it's all, there's more of a,
you know, I don't get a psychedelic high,
[SPEAKER_10]: but it is more of a psychedelic feeling.
[SPEAKER_10]: You get more of a mind trip from it.
[SPEAKER_10]: You get more body high from it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It does something to the oil.
[SPEAKER_10]: It certainly does.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we know what to feed the plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now we want to give them lots of carbs,
a little more nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're still going to have to flush just
like you normally would before you cut
[SPEAKER_10]: down the plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to interrupt with something that
I saw on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_10]: I won't call them out, but hopefully they
listen to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: They posted to Facebook.
[SPEAKER_10]: I found this stud mail time to put them
outside for the season and see what he can
[SPEAKER_10]: do so that I can collect some pollen is
essentially what he said.
[SPEAKER_10]: So many bells went off in my head.
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw that post everybody for four miles
of this dude that is growing outdoors is
[SPEAKER_10]: going to have a hybrid of whatever this
dude put outside.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: The wind and nature are going to do their
things.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, this guy's going to pollinate the
whole neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys, if you've got a male plant,
don't put it outside so that you can
[SPEAKER_10]: pollinate Rob's outdoor crops and you can
fucking pollinate everybody's outdoor
[SPEAKER_10]: crop.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't do that shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Please be, be, be a think full thinker,
a think full stoner.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even be a for thinking grower is
what I need you to be.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, don't put that shit out there.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's rude.
[SPEAKER_10]: Please don't do that.
[SPEAKER_10]: These guys are shaking their heads in
silence.
[SPEAKER_10]: They think they just want to stand up and
walk away from the table.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're like, fuck, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can take a cry break if you need to.
[SPEAKER_10]: People have taken naps on that couch over
there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure a cry break would be acceptable.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, uh, plants are going to grow about six
weeks until the seeds are ready-ish.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, what should we start looking for
during that time period to know if the
[SPEAKER_10]: seeds are getting ready or if we're going
to have to let them go a little bit
[SPEAKER_10]: longer?
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, usually what I'll do if there's
none, sometimes the, uh, they'll split and
[SPEAKER_13]: you'll actually start seeing the seeds
present on the, on the, on the plan.
[SPEAKER_13]: The undersides of the buds.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's it.
[SPEAKER_13]: They'll actually split and the seed likes
to protrude from it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes, you know, when they're ripe and
then you'll actually see the visual seed,
[SPEAKER_13]: you'll see a nice gray, dark color.
[SPEAKER_13]: You'll see nice tiger stripes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Tiger stripes is what you're looking for a
lot of the time.
[SPEAKER_13]: Then, you know, you got a nice ripe seed.
[SPEAKER_13]: You basically want to look for no green
and no white.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's, that's pretty much the two things
you really got to look for.
[SPEAKER_13]: If there's no green and no white and you
got tiger stripes and you got gray,
[SPEAKER_13]: nice gray seeds or dark seeds.
[SPEAKER_13]: And typically, you know, you're ready.
[SPEAKER_10]: A cheat move that I do, um, after about
six weeks of pollination, five and a half,
[SPEAKER_10]: six weeks of pollination, I wait.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then right at the base of the buds
where the stock and the bud meet,
[SPEAKER_10]: there's usually one little calyx that
swells up.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll just pinch that fucker off and roll
it around in my hand.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it, you'll know it's either a seed or
what would have been a seed had you not
[SPEAKER_10]: destroyed it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you guys don't worry about crushing
one or two of those, because if you did
[SPEAKER_10]: this correctly, you're going to have at
least a hundred closer to 500.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you do it like Rob and I do,
um, I've pulled 5,000 seeds from a plant
[SPEAKER_10]: before easily.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm looking at pulling like around at
least a thousand or two from one plant
[SPEAKER_13]: right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: I run, I was running seven gallon pots and
hitting them with big males.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thousands of seeds can come from one
plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, where the hell were we?
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, how long to let it go?
[SPEAKER_10]: What to look for?
[SPEAKER_10]: You can put pinch that one little,
like you guys will see what I'm talking
[SPEAKER_10]: about.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you've got a seeded crop and a lot of
times you'll see these little calyxes on
[SPEAKER_10]: the bottoms of buds and they'll make you
think you've got a seed.
[SPEAKER_13]: I did want to touch on, um, letting them
go a little bit too long.
[SPEAKER_13]: What happened with the ramifications of
letting your seeds go too terribly long
[SPEAKER_13]: and letting plants just basically go into
the point where you're going to lose most
[SPEAKER_13]: of your THC is going to convert over to
CBD and things like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then secondly, not in the progeny in
the bud that's actually growing.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if you've ever had those
seeds, uh, had a batch of seeds from
[SPEAKER_13]: somebody or a reader that you've gotten in
and they're just hard as a rock.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they got really great dark,
the real dark, nice, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_13]: they're just incredibly hard as rock.
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of them have to be scored germinate.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what that's from.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Basically what it is is cause it,
cause the seed is, is this embryo and it's
[SPEAKER_13]: developing a show that's developing a show
and the shell is going to do nothing but
[SPEAKER_13]: like a bone.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to get harder and harder and
harder.
[SPEAKER_13]: The more you pump that plant and
especially it comes from not ripening the
[SPEAKER_13]: plant correctly.
[SPEAKER_13]: Also not flushing properly, things like
that, because you got so many nutrients
[SPEAKER_13]: present is still telling it to drive,
drive, drive, drive.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's going to create that and develop
that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's also when you risk seed
splitting, seed splitting will happen
[SPEAKER_13]: because whenever you pull them out,
they're going to be so overdeveloped that
[SPEAKER_13]: once they start to dry out, they're going
to start cracking and splitting because
[SPEAKER_13]: it's going to be like, there's going to be
such a large embryo inside of this show
[SPEAKER_13]: because it's welled up inside of there.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's growing, you know, so you're going to
have a lot of problems can develop from
[SPEAKER_13]: that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that, that's a lot of the issues when
people have these little issues with
[SPEAKER_13]: seeds, when they get them in the mail and
things like that from different readers
[SPEAKER_13]: and they are cracked and stuff,
but they haven't been, the package is fine
[SPEAKER_13]: and they come great.
[SPEAKER_13]: But the, but you got a couple of cracked
seeds in there and they look great and
[SPEAKER_13]: everything, but you can tell just the
shell split right down the side,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, and you're like, Hey,
this is not going to be good because the
[SPEAKER_13]: embryo is now dried out and dead.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that seeds toast, you know,
and then you get some that you have to
[SPEAKER_13]: score because they just will not germinate
unless you score them.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's talk about that for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the best way to, you guys,
you'll know if the seeds are super hard,
[SPEAKER_10]: really thick shell, you'll be able to tell
by looking, they'll be extra glossy.
[SPEAKER_10]: There'll be a little harder than normal.
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's your first pack of seeds,
you don't have anything to compare it to.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're just going to have to learn,
but what's the best way to score them,
[SPEAKER_10]: to soften them up a little bit,
to get them to grow.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you got a match book, that's a real
good way to do it.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you got a match book, use the side of a
match book, just rub them like that or
[SPEAKER_13]: really fine grid sandpaper.
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't want to use a coarse grid
because it's going to tear it and it's
[SPEAKER_13]: going to tear into it really hard.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you want to use a really fine grid
sandpaper.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's one of the easiest things really to
use.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like to just soak those plants,
put a little bit, a couple of drops of
[SPEAKER_10]: hygrozyme and a glass of water or a jar of
water and soak those plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let those plants soak for about 24 hours
and then put them in the paper towel and
[SPEAKER_10]: germ them like normal.
[SPEAKER_10]: That usually works for me.
[SPEAKER_13]: Another one I use is Dr. Willard's Plant
Catalyst.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's good shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: That is a really good product.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've never talked about that on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: They gave me a free bottle of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: The guy gave me a case.
[SPEAKER_10]: 30 to 60 mils in your reservoir,
he said.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I go, well, how do you know how big my
reservoir is?
[SPEAKER_10]: He goes, it doesn't matter what this,
you put 30 to 60 mils in here and it'll
[SPEAKER_10]: make your plants go faster.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it did.
[SPEAKER_10]: I could see them absorbing more nutrients.
[SPEAKER_13]: We did a side by side with seeds.
[SPEAKER_13]: We took blueberry fuel.
[SPEAKER_13]: We took about 10 of them, germinated them
with regular tap water and then we
[SPEAKER_13]: germinated at the same group.
[SPEAKER_13]: Another 10 seeds, Dr. Willard's and tap
water, 24 hour difference.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was amazed.
[SPEAKER_13]: Every one of those seeds germinated within
24 hours.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was like- Nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the regular tap water took about
36 to 48.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it was a dramatic difference.
[SPEAKER_13]: You could see it was like overnight versus
the next day.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, that's some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we use it religiously.
[SPEAKER_10]: So shout out to Dr. Willard's Plant
Catalyst.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to send us stuff, get in
touch.
[SPEAKER_10]: Grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'd love to help you out.
[SPEAKER_10]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you leave them in there too long,
you guys, your seeds will start splitting.
[SPEAKER_10]: So pay attention.
[SPEAKER_10]: Also check it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to mention this.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is something that comes to mind.
[SPEAKER_10]: If your plants start dropping seeds,
if you have more than one female in the
[SPEAKER_10]: room and seeds fall out of your plant,
you can't just pick that seed up and
[SPEAKER_10]: assume that it came from this girl.
[SPEAKER_10]: That could have came from any of the
females in the room and it could have
[SPEAKER_10]: rolled to that spot.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can't label that one what you think
it fell from.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can only label seeds what you're
fucking sure it came from.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't ever guess when labeling a seed.
[SPEAKER_10]: That is the future of the cannabis genome.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we don't want any confusion.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's your job as a person breeding to take
beautiful notes for the future.
[SPEAKER_10]: Please do that.
[SPEAKER_13]: For example, I just had a crop and we
popped the seed out of it earlier.
[SPEAKER_13]: That goes in the happy accident bag.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Happy accidents are a good thing when
you're in the seed business or the
[SPEAKER_13]: breeding game.
[SPEAKER_13]: Those don't ever make it out to the
public.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a really, really great idea where
it comes.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm almost like 90% sure where it came
from, but I still label this so and put
[SPEAKER_13]: happy accident.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I'll pop that seed and it'll get
a whole new name and a whole new thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: If it stays around, it could be the next
hottest clone only, but more than likely
[SPEAKER_13]: it's going to go in the trash.
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of the super popular shit was an
accident just like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I try to explain people.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's more about selection and not numbers.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can pop them vegan seeds.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're not good at selecting those
plants, what does a vegan seed's worth?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_10]: I found some beautiful keepers that most
people would have just tossed.
[SPEAKER_13]: I can name 10 of the world's most
legendary strange right now that all came
[SPEAKER_13]: from five seeds.
[SPEAKER_13]: Chem dog.
[SPEAKER_13]: Gorilla glue number four.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_13]: Girl's got cookies.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Gainesville green.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know enough about the Florida
weed.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, a lot of the most popular,
we had a white.
[SPEAKER_10]: We actually did a whole episode about
accidents and clone only accidents.
[SPEAKER_10]: East coast sour D.
[SPEAKER_10]: Golden goats.
[SPEAKER_10]: West coast sour D.
[SPEAKER_10]: OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's your job as a breeder,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Please be careful to carefully mark
everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: Make sure you label everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't make any mistakes for the future
because you're going to be growing these
[SPEAKER_10]: seeds and hopefully some of your friends
are going to be growing them and you don't
[SPEAKER_10]: want to mislead people on what is in
there.
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of this stuff is going to be aimed
at medical patients and we want the
[SPEAKER_10]: medical patients to know the genetics of
what they're getting.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really helpful.
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you find some seeds on the floor,
you can use them.
[SPEAKER_10]: You just can't, you just got to be careful
and carefully think about what they are.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't try to say it's this times this
until you grow it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you're certain, then you could be
cool with that.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: So if it's an unknown, just label it an
unknown.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not necessarily a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've seen some of the biggest,
largest breeders in the world labeled
[SPEAKER_13]: their genetics unknown crossed with this.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Gage has a special name with those.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: From us.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, or name it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like Gage's number one male, Joseph.
[SPEAKER_13]: That Joseph male that they used for years
and years and years.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was, it's a bag seed male from
somewhere and nobody knows what it was.
[SPEAKER_13]: So they just named it Joseph OG.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then they labeled it properly as so.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then everybody knows that or we
wouldn't know that.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can actually buy Gage's unlabeled
seeds and they've got a name.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember what they're called,
but you can buy them.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're all the seeds that fell to the
side.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're called good ideas is what his
extra seeds are called.
[SPEAKER_10]: They call them good ideas.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're a good idea, but I don't know what
it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's get back to our little breeding
project here for Fred.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: With seeds in them, they've been
pollinated.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've gone, uh, five and a half,
six ish weeks since the pollen has hit
[SPEAKER_10]: them.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, the pistols are curly and brown.
[SPEAKER_10]: The trichomes are starting to Amber up.
[SPEAKER_10]: The plants are getting mature.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, let's start flushing the plants and
now let's talk about pulling down the
[SPEAKER_10]: plants and getting the seeds out of these
sons of bitches.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_13]: I, I, I harvest them just like I harvest
any other regular plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: I take it down, take away any water leaf,
anything, basically do a light wet trim.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I just.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hang them and let them dry.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, uh, after one, I let them dry a
little bit longer than normal because they
[SPEAKER_13]: are seated plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: They have a denser texture to them.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they're a lot more dense than regular
buds.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you got to really let them dry out a
little longer.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, uh, after they're done,
you know, you just kind of carefully roll
[SPEAKER_13]: them in your hands.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what all I do is just carefully
roll them.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just let the seeds fall,
not from a high place, but from a low
[SPEAKER_13]: spot.
[SPEAKER_13]: Six inches or lower above your table.
[SPEAKER_10]: When you buy a, uh, like a package of ball
jars or Kerr jars, little Mason jars,
[SPEAKER_10]: it comes with that cardboard base to keep
them in place.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love to use that thing or go to the
liquor store and get something that they
[SPEAKER_10]: just put cases of beer in just a little
flat one.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's about, you know, three or four inches
deep and the seeds won't bounce off the
[SPEAKER_10]: cardboard.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, excuse me for clearing the throat
so many times.
[SPEAKER_10]: We took so many dabs today.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, the seeds won't bounce off the
cardboard.
[SPEAKER_10]: I used to try to use a cookie sheet or a
Pyrex dish, but then you take these buds
[SPEAKER_10]: that are filled with seeds and they're dry
and you crumble them up.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you do it right, you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to, it's going to sound like
it's raining.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to go and seeds are going to
come raining out of these buds use
[SPEAKER_10]: cardboard because they will not bounce as
badly as they will out of a cookie sheet
[SPEAKER_10]: or a Pyrex dish.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, so I usually just, like you said,
let the buds drive.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I roll them up in my hands,
crumble them up a little bit, uh,
[SPEAKER_10]: wear a rubber glove because you're going
to get sticky as shit or don't.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're into that, some people like to
get that resin all over their hands.
[SPEAKER_10]: Our friend Rusty, shout out to Rusty.
[SPEAKER_10]: He likes to pick seeds without gloves and
be all dark fingered.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got shit to do.
[SPEAKER_10]: Unless I'm playing with cocoa,
I'm wearing gloves.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like to play with the cocoa barehanded.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, that cocoa just cleans your hands.
[SPEAKER_10]: If your hands are filthy, just go stick
them in the cocoa and mix them around.
[SPEAKER_10]: Your hands will be shiny again.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shit's rad.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So now we've got a bunch of dried bud
material, basically in a bunch of seeds,
[SPEAKER_10]: depending on the size of your garden,
there's a whole bunch of different ways to
[SPEAKER_10]: go and try to pull these seeds out of your
buds.
[SPEAKER_10]: I should mention this while we're here
because we're all stoned and we might fuck
[SPEAKER_10]: up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep your female plants separate at this
point.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like if you're working with more than one
varietal, more than one strain of females
[SPEAKER_10]: in this breeding project, keep the bitches
separate because you don't want to get
[SPEAKER_10]: your seeds confused.
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to have carefully labeled seeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, that's the whole part of why you're
breeding is so that you can know what's
[SPEAKER_10]: going on.
[SPEAKER_10]: So keep the girls separated.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you find seeds on the floor in the dry
room, once again, those are good ideas.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't label those unless you're certain of
what they are.
[SPEAKER_10]: So now we've got all this material.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you've got a little crop, if your
garden is kind of small, you can simply do
[SPEAKER_10]: the old school method where you put the
little container at an angle and slide the
[SPEAKER_10]: weed up to the top and the seeds will roll
to the bottom and the dried weed material
[SPEAKER_10]: stay at the top.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like get you a good tray,
a good magazine, whatever floats your
[SPEAKER_13]: boat, 45 degree angle, pack of rolling
papers, put on some music and just go at
[SPEAKER_13]: it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Put all those seeds in a jar and let it
go.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the easiest way to do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you're doing it on a level to where
you've got a seed company, that's going to
[SPEAKER_10]: get tedious.
[SPEAKER_10]: Really quickly.
[SPEAKER_10]: You and your friends can only sit around
for so long and you're going to have to
[SPEAKER_10]: give away so many packs of seeds for
breaking their back.
[SPEAKER_10]: So they do sell a my good friends at mile
high seed company.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to my high seed company.
[SPEAKER_10]: They showed me a device.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually a bird seed separator.
[SPEAKER_10]: That thing is sweet.
[SPEAKER_10]: You pour all your material.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: You pour your material into the top and
it's got a little hand crank on it and it
[SPEAKER_10]: just spits seeds out one side and all the
other material falls right out of the
[SPEAKER_10]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can just put that over a bucket.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can actually buy a fully automatic one
nowadays.
[SPEAKER_13]: It actually separates everything.
[SPEAKER_13]: For you and everything.
[SPEAKER_13]: It likes to separate your trim and
everything from your seed.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you'll have it in one pile.
[SPEAKER_13]: It has a nice column and there's,
and then it'll have a clear container
[SPEAKER_13]: below it.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can get them on eBay.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just look up parrot seed cleaning machine.
[SPEAKER_13]: How much are they about they run?
[SPEAKER_13]: Your price point is going to be about $159
to buy one.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's worth it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just the time that you it's, it's like
trimming.
[SPEAKER_10]: Trimming is fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: The first seven times, but after once
you've trimmed 10 times, you want to put
[SPEAKER_10]: the scissors in your eye.
[SPEAKER_13]: Basically the concept was, you know,
I was actually a zoologist for two years.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's how I knew about them.
[SPEAKER_13]: And basically what it is, is parrots and
birds.
[SPEAKER_13]: Whenever you rear birds and in an aviary,
they, they, they waste about 75 to 80% of
[SPEAKER_13]: the food.
[SPEAKER_13]: They, they're really picky eaters.
[SPEAKER_13]: So they kind of go through the food and
sit through what they want at the time and
[SPEAKER_13]: throw the rest in the ground.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, so basically you take all your bird
feed that you buy in the store.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's quite expensive for these parrots
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you run it through the machine and you
get like 70 cents, 70% return back and you
[SPEAKER_13]: just keep recycling until it's all gone.
[SPEAKER_13]: Birds are dicks.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So now, Oh God, excuse me guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to blame that on this hit mat or
the mothership rig that Will brought over.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for bringing over the mothership.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was rad.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and shout out to this distillate.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure if we can talk about too much
where this distillate came from,
[SPEAKER_10]: but I've got a friend out there named
Frosty who I owe a huge shout out to.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys want to link those two together?
[SPEAKER_10]: You can, but I don't know if they're
related.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got a bunch of material we've
pulled.
[SPEAKER_10]: We put our seeds into the little bird
feeder.
[SPEAKER_10]: We put all our stuff into the bird feeder.
[SPEAKER_10]: We pulled the seeds and material out.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can smoke that material or you can
make hash out of that material,
[SPEAKER_10]: or you can make edibles out of that
material.
[SPEAKER_10]: There are so many uses for that material.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys, it is still good quality
product.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can roll joints out of it and smoke
it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like to give it to my friend Will and
let him make BHO out of it for me.
[SPEAKER_10]: It works really well.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: The high from it, like I said earlier,
is amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can also make oil out of it,
make edibles out of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can make butter out of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can do anything that you would do with
any other buds out of that material.
[SPEAKER_10]: So seeds, there is controversy online.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do seeds need to cure?
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe they do.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it also all depends on, that's not
where I feel the controversy comes from is
[SPEAKER_13]: from people in that it's climate.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's climatic.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's where the controversy comes from.
[SPEAKER_13]: Coming from the deep swamp, the floor to
the 100% humidity, 160 degree days,
[SPEAKER_13]: every single day of the week is wet.
[SPEAKER_13]: The air is like soup.
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to cure seeds for like three or
four weeks to get them to germinate.
[SPEAKER_10]: You said the air is like soup.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is like that in the south.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's bad.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been to some festivals down south and
it killed me.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was walking at the, I was at a festival
just walking and I was covered in sweat
[SPEAKER_10]: and I thought I was okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I looked around at my friends.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_10]: Fucking I'm sitting down.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was like, you okay?
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was like, I'm cool, but I'm too
fucking hot.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to sit down right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just needed a minute just to not be
so damn hot for a minute.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was rough.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's real muggy.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's a lot of the humidity and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: The higher the humidity, the longer you'll
have to cure your seeds.
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the best tricks I've learned since
I moved over here to Colorado,
[SPEAKER_13]: it takes about three or four days to cure.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I back a four bowl, two foot long T5
fixture.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I back it off about two to three feet
off a pan.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I let the UGD and all the UV rays and
everything cure the seeds in about three
[SPEAKER_13]: days.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I swear they jump.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right out of the seed.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: As soon as it hits water.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, they, they want to fly right out.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we've all of our testers came
back a hundred percent germination.
[SPEAKER_13]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, hundreds and hundreds of seeds.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it was just like, that was a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's also a few dry ice methods.
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you looking for any testers?
[SPEAKER_13]: Always, always looking for good testers as
willing to put in the effort and throw
[SPEAKER_13]: back the result that that's, that's,
that's what we're always looking for.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's let a lot of people hit me up to be
a tester.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure people hit you up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's just give these guys an idea of who
is a qualified tester so that we don't
[SPEAKER_10]: have to keep typing these emails.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I'm looking for, I'm looking for at
least minimum three to five years
[SPEAKER_13]: experience.
[SPEAKER_13]: I want you to pretty much have already run
through every book there is on the planet
[SPEAKER_13]: that you can get your hands on the
resource material that's out there because
[SPEAKER_13]: you're given all this free resource
material nowadays, especially with the
[SPEAKER_13]: internet and things like that,
that there's no really excuse for you not
[SPEAKER_13]: to educate yourself.
[SPEAKER_13]: You have it right in front of your face to
educate yourself.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's, that's the first number one thing
I can tell any growers educate yourself.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's going to make you a better
grower.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody always, I have, what can I do to
make my plants better?
[SPEAKER_13]: What can I do to learn this?
[SPEAKER_13]: That educate yourself.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the best thing you can do.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And nobody's going to do it for you.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the real world.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just the way it is.
[SPEAKER_13]: It sucks, but it'll make you better.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you know, this is the way that none of
us learned the easy way, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: no one held our hand through it or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, this is the way you have to do
it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, and then from there,
you know, just did, did we're looking for,
[SPEAKER_13]: we're looking for people that are,
you know, head strong, that are internet,
[SPEAKER_13]: slightly internet savvy, you know,
that can type a complete sentence.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you can't top a complete sentence,
you're automatically disqualified.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, if you say bae, you're
disqualified.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll agree with that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: At least one or two lights that you can
fully dedicate to the seeds that I'm going
[SPEAKER_10]: to send you.
[SPEAKER_10]: At least, at least one light for the 10
pack of seeds that you're going to get for
[SPEAKER_10]: free.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want one light of your space.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want you to be able to make a diary of
what you're, of how your grow went.
[SPEAKER_10]: How many of the seeds I sent you
germinated?
[SPEAKER_10]: How many of them were females?
[SPEAKER_10]: How many were hermaphrodites?
[SPEAKER_10]: How long did it take to see sex?
[SPEAKER_10]: How long did it take you to find the
hermaphrodite?
[SPEAKER_10]: How many of those plants were male and
female out of those females?
[SPEAKER_10]: How many were keepers?
[SPEAKER_10]: How many would you run again?
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you run this strain again?
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have the ability to get this plant
tested for THC, CBD, THC, THC?
[SPEAKER_10]: THCA, THCV, CBG?
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have testing capabilities?
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have terpings testing abilities?
[SPEAKER_10]: How was the flavor?
[SPEAKER_10]: How was the high?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, was it worth a shoot at all?
[SPEAKER_10]: How long did it take to flower?
[SPEAKER_10]: We want that kind of notes.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we want you to get a camera.
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's your iPhone, that's rad.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you've got a better camera,
we want you to get a good camera.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want pictures at least once a week
of each phenotype carefully labeled with
[SPEAKER_10]: the week number, the strain name,
and the phenotype number that you have
[SPEAKER_10]: selected for that.
[SPEAKER_13]: But we can't stand in the industry as the
guy that we give 20 seeds to that pops
[SPEAKER_13]: three seeds and it takes six months to get
a report back on those three seeds.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm trying to- I cannot stand that more
than anything.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're that guy, you suck, guy.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just going to go ahead and say that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been that guy before because our
friend Gage Green Genetics sent me about
[SPEAKER_10]: 7,000 packs of seeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so he's like, have you tested those
yet?
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm like, I only have so many plants,
bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: Which ones?
[SPEAKER_13]: I can only pull over so far.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to Gage.
[SPEAKER_10]: Gage really helped myself out in the
cannabis industry, helping me get where I
[SPEAKER_10]: am.
[SPEAKER_10]: So shout out to Gage Green.
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's tell them why it's so
frustrating.
[SPEAKER_10]: When I send you testers, it's because I'm
trying to release a new product line and I
[SPEAKER_10]: want to get research done on that so that
I don't put out seeds that are shit
[SPEAKER_10]: because I don't want to put them available
at the dankteam.com and then you spend
[SPEAKER_10]: money on them and then they totally suck.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I send out to my testing team,
I send out quite a large batch of test
[SPEAKER_10]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've sent out entire first runs of test
batches.
[SPEAKER_10]: This first breeding project, I kept like
250 of them and then sent fucking a
[SPEAKER_10]: thousand seeds out to other people to run.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then if it's worth the shit,
I'll make more.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I always find too, the easiest way to
select the best phenotype out of a
[SPEAKER_13]: thousand seeds is to have a bunch of
really good testers and stay in contact
[SPEAKER_13]: with them and keep up with them and have
them keep up with you.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then that way, whenever it comes down
to it and you're like, hey, well here's
[SPEAKER_13]: something that you don't have for doing
all that work and give them a little trade
[SPEAKER_13]: off or something for finding it for you.
[SPEAKER_13]: You find keepers and things like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: You find test results that you don't find
other places.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's how I know personally, like a lot
of Rusty's and CanAventures cuts and
[SPEAKER_13]: things like that were found.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's how our blueberry field was found
out of over 500 seeds.
[SPEAKER_13]: And three years later, it was,
it came out of Boston and ended up out of
[SPEAKER_13]: Boston.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's my boy, Willie in Boston.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got a friend who's doing a really
good job with Capelten and I'm waiting for
[SPEAKER_10]: a cut of that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I've got a friend who can't be
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's got a really good cut of the,
the blue healer thing, which has some
[SPEAKER_10]: little bit of blue dream in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I tried to fix it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was trying to fix the blue dream.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just added terpenes to it that wasn't
presently there.
[SPEAKER_13]: It just, it does really well with OG
terps.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's what we've found because it's
already got some I've ever seen present
[SPEAKER_13]: and some other things that you normally
don't typically find in sativas,
[SPEAKER_13]: but you can't really taste it in the blue
dream.
[SPEAKER_13]: So why not give it that extra kick and add
terpenes that aren't normally there in
[SPEAKER_13]: different structures in a shorter
flowering time.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what you need.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what you need nowadays.
[SPEAKER_13]: It is a great parent.
[SPEAKER_13]: That that's, that's really where it's
where it lies at anymore.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think it has a place on the top
shelf market anymore.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, but, but to us breeders, I still
think it's still golden to these days.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause it is so stable.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'll give it that, you know,
that, that sets where that's why it's
[SPEAKER_13]: close to me is in my heart.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is cause it's always been a great
breeder.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can hit it with anything.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can hit it with Aphroditic jeans and
it's going to come out great.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've done it and had happy accidents and
great ideas.
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't encourage anybody to, no,
no, don't do that on purpose.
[SPEAKER_13]: Definitely don't do that on purpose.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to back up and something we
didn't talk about.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're making feminized seeds,
you need to get that male going way early,
[SPEAKER_10]: three weeks ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're trying to get your female plants
ready to flower at week three,
[SPEAKER_10]: you want to get those males and you want
to start spraying them in veg.
[SPEAKER_10]: Spray them in veg for a week and then
flower them almost six weeks ahead of
[SPEAKER_10]: those girl plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to get them a nice fat head
start.
[SPEAKER_10]: Reversing a plant takes a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_10]: It takes a lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_10]: You need to stifle the copper movement in
the plant by hitting it with the silver
[SPEAKER_10]: thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_10]: The plant needs to react.
[SPEAKER_10]: It needs to learn what to do with that
reaction.
[SPEAKER_10]: It needs to change its hormones to create,
create pollen.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then it needs to develop these sacks to
create pollen.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then it will release pollen.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to take a long, long time.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're making your first reverse male,
you're going to be like, I did it wrong.
[SPEAKER_10]: You just got to spray it more and more and
more and more.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't even waste time with colloidal
silver.
[SPEAKER_10]: Make your own silver thiosulfate spray.
[SPEAKER_13]: Since all these new growers are coming on
the scene, people are trying to create
[SPEAKER_13]: their new strengths and stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: The colloidal silver hype is coming back
stronger than ever.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was around about 10 years ago and now
it's back like bell bottoms, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just like, no, the colloidal silver
don't do it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't block the gene well enough and
for long enough and hard enough.
[SPEAKER_13]: Strong enough to not create a high ratio
of hermaphrodite problems.
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't do it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Use SDS.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's proper.
[SPEAKER_13]: You haven't in the long run.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's cheaper.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's cheaper.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it's so much cheaper.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to throw it away because I make too
large of a batch at one time.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Throw tons of it away.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's, it's dirt cheap.
[SPEAKER_10]: Once you buy your first batch,
I've got some from two years ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_10]: You use, I think you buy a one ounce and a
three ounce jar.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think you use like three grams and
two grams out of each jar for your first
[SPEAKER_10]: mix.
[SPEAKER_10]: That jar is this big.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can store that jar for like 40,
50 bucks.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like we said earlier, it's in the fridge
right next door to the pollen that we
[SPEAKER_10]: store and it's right in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't degrade in there as long as
moisture doesn't get into it.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're going to make silver thiosulfate
spray, one way to keep it around longer,
[SPEAKER_10]: when you mix the two components into these
separate containers of water, keep them
[SPEAKER_10]: separate.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't mix them and they'll store longer.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I also never spray my SDS under light.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Always take it out.
[SPEAKER_13]: Spray it in darkness till it's just
dripping off.
[SPEAKER_13]: I try to get the undersides of the leaves,
the stalks.
[SPEAKER_13]: The stalks are important.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Spray the stalks.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then let it dry out really good.
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe even with a little fan beside it and
let it dry out real good.
[SPEAKER_13]: Make sure everything's dry.
[SPEAKER_13]: Otherwise you will get burn marks.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, and if you put it back in a room
with some girls that you're not trying to
[SPEAKER_10]: flip, you'll have some trannies in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll make some, some Caitlyn Jenner,
Caitlyn Jenner OG on accident.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause a little bit of rub here,
a little bit of rub there, a little STS
[SPEAKER_13]: here, a little STS there.
[SPEAKER_13]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_13]: You learn from experience.
[SPEAKER_13]: You learn from doing it the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some plants are going to take a whole
bunch of spray.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some are not.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then some are going to burn from it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: If the leaves curl up and look pissed off,
as long as you still have enough of that
[SPEAKER_10]: plant to create pollen, you're going to be
all right.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's that male plant is going to look like
shit after that silver thiosulfate spray.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's what people really need to
understand too about reversing plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're not, I've had somebody come into my
grow and say, Oh, you have a hermy plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was like, no, it's a reverse plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: They look at me and go, huh?
[SPEAKER_13]: And they just look at me, you know,
with the most baffled look on their face
[SPEAKER_13]: and they don't understand what I'm talking
about.
[SPEAKER_13]: Reverse plant is totally different than a
hermaphroditic plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: We did this on purpose.
[SPEAKER_13]: We did this on purpose and we're blocking
genes.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're actually blocking genes in the
genome.
[SPEAKER_13]: Whereas hermaphroditic is like that
because of its genome.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the silver, the silver hits the plant
and it can't move by itself.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the thiosulfate solution makes it
mobile and absorbable within the plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that blocks the copper production in
the plant, the copper movement in the
[SPEAKER_10]: plant, which triggers an ethylene
response.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it ethyl or ethylene?
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_10]: Either way.
[SPEAKER_10]: Come on, help me out.
[SPEAKER_10]: It triggers a response of ethyl or
ethylene.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to say ethyl because ethylene
sounds like more of a, like I'm making
[SPEAKER_10]: meth, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: It sounds like a methylamine.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're thinking ethanol.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, either way it, it messes up.
[SPEAKER_10]: It triggers that hormone and that hormone
is what tells the plant that it wants to
[SPEAKER_10]: change sexes and start producing pollens.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then you make pollen that since this plant
has no male chromosomes, it will not
[SPEAKER_10]: donate any male chromosomes to the
breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll all be female chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_13]: So basically it's taken back to its
mothers.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the mother of the plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's pretty much what it is.
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you have a 50-50 hybrid,
that's what you can expect it to lean
[SPEAKER_13]: toward that mother side.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then it's ideal once you find the
keeper, if, and I didn't realize not a lot
[SPEAKER_10]: of people were doing this when I started
breeding.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was reversing a female to a male and
hitting several females.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I was making nine or 10 feminized
crosses at one time.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I realized later that that's not
industry standard of how that's done.
[SPEAKER_10]: Most of the time people will take a clone
only or their favorite plant and reverse
[SPEAKER_10]: that and hit that pollen on a bunch of the
same clones and just keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've actually been reversing plants and
true breeding with those reversed plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I didn't even realize how far out of
the norm I was stepping.
[SPEAKER_10]: Most folks would find a keeper and then
keep reversing that one to keep making
[SPEAKER_10]: more and more and more.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I've actually, I reversed the plant,
pollinated another plant of the clone of
[SPEAKER_10]: the same strain, made seedlings of that,
took seeds of that, took that original
[SPEAKER_10]: plant and I reversed and hit the pollen on
that one.
[SPEAKER_10]: And after a few finial generations of
inbreeding, I was unable to reverse the
[SPEAKER_10]: plant with silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_10]: I bred it so, so strong that it's so
female, it will not reverse on me.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a Grateful Dog experiment and I
called it GD77 is the one that will not
[SPEAKER_10]: reverse.
[SPEAKER_10]: 1977 is my favorite year as the Grateful
Ted is why it got GD77.
[SPEAKER_10]: Random breeder shit right there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I have another rant I want to kind of
go on, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: It might piss people off.
[SPEAKER_10]: It frustrates me when hash makers put two
different strains in a tube and run it
[SPEAKER_10]: together and think that they can now call
it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, no, that took you seven minutes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like it takes me fucking years to develop
something that I get to name.
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't get to name it.
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't get to name something who
express because you put Dr. Who and
[SPEAKER_10]: Pineapple Express in a fucking container
together.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm half serious, I'm half frustrated,
half don't care.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's misleading to the industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's misleading to the medical patients
because it's hard for them to know what
[SPEAKER_11]: strains.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that this is Dr. Who and probably
Pineapple Express because I've been in
[SPEAKER_10]: this long enough, but it's called Who
Express.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're a medical patient and you're not
hip and paying attention on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_10]: you don't know what the fuck that is.
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe Dr. Who is your favorite,
but maybe Pineapple Express gives you
[SPEAKER_10]: panic attacks.
[SPEAKER_11]: That could be OG and Tangy for all you
know.
[SPEAKER_11]: They can name it whatever they want.
[SPEAKER_13]: It could be a handful of Who and the rest
Express.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I understand first that you don't
know.
[SPEAKER_13]: You just don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it really 50-50 bland or is it why they
don't even label it so?
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm not trying to be a hater on that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just think that that's a little bit
misleading.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've come to the point in technology in
this cannabis industry where we're
[SPEAKER_13]: supposed to be stepping it up here in
Colorado and everything else.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're the guys that are, these guys
sitting at this table right now,
[SPEAKER_13]: among other growers, here in Colorado are
the ones that are sitting in the forefront
[SPEAKER_13]: for all the other states because they're
all looking at the state going,
[SPEAKER_13]: how do we do this?
[SPEAKER_13]: And they're falling in line.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're following our models.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're taking the lead.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then it started ever since I've been
in Colorado and we're proud to be a part
[SPEAKER_13]: of that.
[SPEAKER_10]: This particular company will only accept
1,000 gram runs.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I understand the need to mix shit
because if you've got a pound of this and
[SPEAKER_10]: a pound of this, then you got a thousand
gram run.
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of trim.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, a lot of trim.
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they make a great product.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to say their name or
anything because I kind of just talk shit,
[SPEAKER_10]: but they do make a great product.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just find it frustrating and misleading
almost to the market.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, no, I mean, you're not really
talking to you.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're just giving them constructive
criticism.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all that is.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, if they can't label it,
then they should label it as so.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, that makes them that much better.
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: No disrespect to the people that are
forced to combine batches because metric
[SPEAKER_10]: makes you do certain shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: I get it, but I just wish it didn't have
to be that way.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because as a breeder, I get to take
Grateful Dog and Girl Scout cookies and
[SPEAKER_10]: put it together and call it doggy style.
[SPEAKER_10]: If two people do that to hash,
I don't feel like, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_10]: they just grab two tubes and mix my trim
together.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now they just made a new strain.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now I can't use the name that they
just took.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why this one right here,
you see, I just call it the people that
[SPEAKER_11]: did it blend, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_11]: That is really cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like how you labeled that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wish I could say their names out loud
right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool folks.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good people.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wish they were still sitting at this
table right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've gotten to the point where we're
pulling seeds out of the bud.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're curing buds.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's where we are.
[SPEAKER_10]: I try to keep tabs on where we are.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even have any notebook paper and I
can still do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm kind of proud of myself.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got to cure them.
[SPEAKER_10]: You say that here in Colorado,
we only got to cure them for like three or
[SPEAKER_10]: four days.
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't realize that in the swamp,
in the South that you had soup for air.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that makes a lot more sense to me,
to people that have argued that they need
[SPEAKER_10]: some cure time.
[SPEAKER_10]: My theory was that the seeds finish in the
buds, in nature, the seeds would finish in
[SPEAKER_10]: the buds.
[SPEAKER_10]: The buds would kind of dry up and die and
they would fall into the ground and they
[SPEAKER_10]: would sit in the ground all winter.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that would be their natural cure time,
which is part of why I keep my seeds in a
[SPEAKER_10]: cooler.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause I think that nature would keep them
in the snow, maybe depending on where they
[SPEAKER_10]: are, maybe cold rain.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then that's what's also going to
germinate them.
[SPEAKER_10]: The rains are going to come and germinate
them in the spring and then they're going
[SPEAKER_10]: to start popping up.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just figured that they would kind of be
curing in the plant in nature.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: They've actually been, they've been
domesticated to the point now where
[SPEAKER_13]: there's only like, there's only certain
regions of the world.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's like a handful of places in the
world that weed actually grows just
[SPEAKER_13]: completely naturally, like actual weed,
not hemp, you know, actual cannabis that
[SPEAKER_13]: it grows naturally, you know, you know,
West Himalayan mountains, places like
[SPEAKER_13]: that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd love to go up there where I've seen
Aryan and his crew go up and smoke some of
[SPEAKER_10]: that outdoor weed.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to keep talking about seeds,
but I've got another random note that I
[SPEAKER_10]: want to interrupt because I've got some
great people here that are great to have
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis conversation with.
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you guys seen Aryan from greenhouse
seeds, Aryan and Franco and Simon travel
[SPEAKER_10]: all around the world and they go to these
places where they're growing land race
[SPEAKER_10]: genetics and they check it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they ask the farmers for seeds and the
farmers happily will give them a bag of
[SPEAKER_10]: seeds, your seeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: Aryan then in return hands them packs of
his colored greenhouse seeds because his
[SPEAKER_10]: seeds are rolled in colored coating
because then he can tell what strain they
[SPEAKER_10]: are without having them in packaging.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're rolled in some candy coating that
is also works as a fertilizer and helps
[SPEAKER_10]: your plants germinate.
[SPEAKER_10]: So he trades them these oftentimes
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you guys feel that he is fucking up the
land race genetics in these places by
[SPEAKER_10]: adulterating them with his seeds?
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess if they're planning, I'm like
right out there with their land races and
[SPEAKER_11]: they're cross pollinating and I guess he
just, they just keep dying and re re re
[SPEAKER_11]: growing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then eventually I guess it's going to
be a different.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_11]: It does.
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck up the heirloom line.
[SPEAKER_13]: But at the same time, I've seen a lot of
those heirloom genetics and stuff like
[SPEAKER_13]: that and nothing really brag home about.
[SPEAKER_13]: They look great on paper, but they look
like some straight swag when they're
[SPEAKER_13]: finished drying.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's really nothing to them.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the hindsight is 50 50.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I mean, he's going to bring a
better yielding strains.
[SPEAKER_13]: To places like, you know, Africa and
places like that, but it was in Jamaica is
[SPEAKER_13]: where actually saw him do this.
Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: But like you're saying it does.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's, it's, it's, it's, it's kind of at
what cost kind of thing, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's, it's, it's like, yeah, you're going
to, you're going to give them better
[SPEAKER_13]: genetics for their future.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, and their kids and their
kids and their kids are going to have
[SPEAKER_13]: better yielding, better plants and stuff
like that, which is going to yield more
[SPEAKER_13]: profits for them.
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're going to be able to yield more
food for their families and things like
[SPEAKER_13]: that.
[SPEAKER_13]: But at the same time, you know,
like you said, you're going to come in
[SPEAKER_13]: here, you're going to completely
disasterize those heirlooms, which,
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, that's thousands of generations
of people, you know, that have been doing
[SPEAKER_13]: the same thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's, it's history, but change is
inevitable.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm torn on the subject.
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to really kind of look 50 50 at
everything.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause life is a carburetor.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to have good and bad to it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like Will said, someone's going to get in
there at some point.
[SPEAKER_11]: Something at some point, what is I'm sure
over the thousands of years that there's
[SPEAKER_11]: been another type of cross that got in
there on accident somehow.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: It could have been somebody's Mexican weed
from Florida or it could be greenhouse
[SPEAKER_13]: seeds, white widow.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I guess greenhouse seeds isn't so bad.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll give him that much.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So now the seeds are cured.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got a big ass bag or maybe a smaller
portion of dried and cured seeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: How do we store them?
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, you can use dried rice.
[SPEAKER_13]: What I like to do is steal silicon packets
out of electronics and things and things I
[SPEAKER_13]: get in the mail.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, so you keep all those.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Those little silicon packs that you get,
like when you buy a new computer or phone
[SPEAKER_13]: or exactly.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: You take those.
[SPEAKER_13]: I collect all those.
[SPEAKER_13]: I save them up here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's pretty dry.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just grab them, throw them in the
freezer as soon as, or freezer
[SPEAKER_13]: refrigerator as soon as possible to keep
moisture away from them.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that way they're, they prolong the
life of them.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can kind of tell when they're good and
when they're bad and if they're nice and
[SPEAKER_13]: good and clear color, they're good.
[SPEAKER_13]: If they turn like a dark or an amber color
or dark brown colors, they're no longer
[SPEAKER_13]: useful.
[SPEAKER_13]: They've actually pulled moisture and
bacteria and things out of the air,
[SPEAKER_13]: which gave them that color, the oxidized.
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're no longer good.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's one good way to find out when you
know, crack it open, take a look.
[SPEAKER_13]: I always crack them open, put them all in
a big jar and actually give them in my
[SPEAKER_13]: seed packages.
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually in our vials, we do a layer of
beads that we do a layer and then we do a
[SPEAKER_13]: layer of cotton, then the seeds and the
cotton, then the beads.
[SPEAKER_13]: That way it's like a 30 year storage vial.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, you can throw that in your
refrigerator for 30 years and pull it out,
[SPEAKER_13]: pop those seeds.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's impressive.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's simple.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have to up my game.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's simple, but effective.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause we got the, you know, we got the
Mylar packaging, which in itself is a food
[SPEAKER_13]: saving package.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we had the vial inside and then
we use those beads.
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of the time girls would get them.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you don't get them, that's cause we
didn't have any to get right at the
[SPEAKER_13]: moment, but either way you still get the
cotton and the vial and everything else
[SPEAKER_13]: like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: But typically we always put beads in there
with them and people have asked me,
[SPEAKER_13]: what's that for?
[SPEAKER_13]: Testers have asked me, what are these
beads for?
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, are the seeds in there?
[SPEAKER_13]: I had one guy ask me, are the seeds in
there?
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause I couldn't see them in the cotton.
[SPEAKER_13]: You couldn't see them in the cotton and
there was just these little silicon beads
[SPEAKER_13]: in there.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you know, it also kind of throws them
off if you're looking for them and things
[SPEAKER_13]: like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's helpful.
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And a refrigerator store, not freezer.
[SPEAKER_13]: I would say you don't want to,
you don't want a freezer.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause once you get below freezing point,
you're basically the water inside of the
[SPEAKER_13]: embryo is trying to expand.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: You'll have more cracks.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's basically, you're basically
creating a large earthquake inside of your
[SPEAKER_13]: embryo because it's trying to expand and
crack outwards.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it has nowhere else to go.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's, it's, it's isolated in that shell.
[SPEAKER_13]: So all the water in there is going to
crack and expand that, that, that embryo
[SPEAKER_13]: and destroy it.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you really want to stay anything above
freezing temperature, 32 degrees,
[SPEAKER_13]: bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now here's my favorite part.
[SPEAKER_10]: Once you've got a whole bunch of seeds,
you've got your herbs separated.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do something with that herb.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to move on to talk about
seeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: My favorite part, grow a bunch of the
things.
[SPEAKER_10]: Get as many as you can and figure out how
much space you've got and then grow,
[SPEAKER_10]: plant more seeds than that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Even if you're not a large scale breeder
and you have 500 seeds, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: give them to your friends and get your own
testing.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, that's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, the guys like me, give them the
guys like will take some, we'll grow them.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not afraid.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you might have some amazing shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll go 10 of them for you.
[SPEAKER_13]: I got some in from California called
silver widow.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, uh, it's a super silver haze,
white widow cross.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to take 112 days to finish.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of the pictures look great.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, uh, you know, there's some good
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're there.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're there.
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to find them, but, uh,
yeah, it's a search.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a, it's a search.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, you just, and if there's nothing
there, then we throw them in the trash can
[SPEAKER_13]: and it's just how it works afterwards.
[SPEAKER_13]: We, we smoke it and blast it, whatever we
do.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you know, it goes, go onto,
onto the next project.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, you got to have a passion for
doing what you do.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's, that's a lot of it too.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's another thing we're looking for
testers.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's, that's, that's passion,
passion.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's how many, uh, people dedicated to
what they do just because they do it
[SPEAKER_13]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_10]: What percentage of your breeding project
gets totally scrapped?
[SPEAKER_10]: So you breed, you make seeds, you take a
few of those seeds, you grow out so many
[SPEAKER_10]: of them, and then you go, uh, how many
times have you just completely flushed a
[SPEAKER_10]: bag of seeds down the toilet because the
project wasn't worth a shit?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd say at least 30, 40% of the time.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a good breeder right there.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just actually went through my box like
two weeks ago, man, just threw away like
[SPEAKER_13]: handfuls and handfuls of stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of stuff from Michigan, a lot of
stuff I did back in Florida, a lot of,
[SPEAKER_13]: a lot of the old stuff I had just,
just tossing it.
[SPEAKER_10]: As a breeder, it's important that you
don't get your ego stuck on a strain.
[SPEAKER_10]: You might really think that this cross
you've got and this male you've got is
[SPEAKER_10]: going to make the next fucking hype.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if it doesn't, don't be afraid to
throw it away.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead and toss it.
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't want those shitty seeds out on
the market.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can breed again.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can make something way better.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you're not going to be known as
that guy that made that hermaphroditic
[SPEAKER_10]: weak shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: You might be that guy that made that next
flame.
[SPEAKER_13]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we want to know, we want to know if
you got problems with seeds.
[SPEAKER_13]: We want to know if you do a great garden
and you're automatically having
[SPEAKER_13]: hermaphroditic problems and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_13]: We want to know these things.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some breeders don't want to know and some
breeders are too big to give a shit,
[SPEAKER_13]: but we're not those guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that for a fact that we're always
down to answer questions and that's why
[SPEAKER_13]: we're here right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, thanks for coming for a few,
man.
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_10]: What else do you think we should cover?
[SPEAKER_10]: We got all the way down to growing them,
giving them out to your friends.
[SPEAKER_10]: Start to finish.
[SPEAKER_10]: Grow them.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the next step.
[SPEAKER_10]: Take careful notes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Find the keepers.
[SPEAKER_10]: Give them to your friends to grow.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then make F2s because F2 is where shit
gets really fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then you get a recessive segregation,
transgressive segregation.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Transgressive segregation.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's where your offspring will show
better traits than its parents.
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll outperform each parent.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, you'll see some cool shit
happening there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't believe in too much hype that you
hear on things.
[SPEAKER_13]: You either try it for yourself and make
your own determination.
[SPEAKER_13]: True.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't be afraid to get in there and grow
some stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've had F6 lavenders from someone.
[SPEAKER_13]: Every one of them is hermy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, so you really would you attribute
that to the way that he makes his pollen
[SPEAKER_13]: sometimes?
[SPEAKER_13]: He does.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then he also does a lot of
rottalization.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that for a fact.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's written articles on it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've read from him that he's done a lot of
rottalization, which is basically taking a
[SPEAKER_13]: plant past its harvest point to the point
where it's creating a female banana,
[SPEAKER_13]: then harvesting a female banana,
which basically is hermaphroditic banana.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he also will light a fire and almost
put the plant on fire.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it goes into a panic mode and that
panic mode makes it do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes it spit out herm flowers,
which have herm pollen.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can also do it with light stress.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So he does a lot of old school funky shit
that ... Overwatering and stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's done a lot of great things.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of his strains are some of the
greatest ones.
[SPEAKER_13]: And still to this day, lavender,
I mentioned that's a legendary strain.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when you get good phenotypes out of
them, they taste amazing.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's so Gouda.
[SPEAKER_13]: Man, some of the best concentrates that
lavender is on point.
[SPEAKER_13]: But there's a lot of these old school
strains.
[SPEAKER_13]: And someone was one of the guys,
if it wasn't for him, the New York City so
[SPEAKER_13]: really wouldn't be as hot today as it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: I really liked his ... Oh man,
the G13 Hayes.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a G13 Hayes that I picked up a
while back from Soma that was amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I loved the flavor of that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of the stuff is still hit and miss,
but when you find the good keepers,
[SPEAKER_13]: they're keepers.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_13]: They're keepers.
[SPEAKER_13]: But you got to run a lot of his gear to
find those keepers.
[SPEAKER_13]: It reminds me of DJ Shortz the same way.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's nothing against DJ,
but quit breeding girl weed.
[SPEAKER_10]: But DJ Breed's specifically for what he
wants.
[SPEAKER_10]: He doesn't give a shit about the market.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's a sativa lover.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's a sativa lover and that's what he
breeds.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's his thing, but he has to
understand.
[SPEAKER_13]: He does pay for a lot of his advertising.
[SPEAKER_13]: He gets great advertising.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll tell you, that dude has got some
bad-ass advertising guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: I like his book.
[SPEAKER_13]: His book is definitely good.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's a great breeder.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's a great grower and things like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just not my forte.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's the same thing with him.
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to run a hundred seeds to get a
good type.
[SPEAKER_13]: Whereas I can generally say, I know you,
Gage, me, and Adventure, quite a few
[SPEAKER_13]: others in this game.
[SPEAKER_13]: Mile high.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've had 10 packs and found three keepers
out of.
[SPEAKER_13]: Heat, Rare Dankness.
[SPEAKER_13]: Rare Dankness, those two keepers.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've gotten some really wonky plants from
Rare Dankness.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to say, in the same 10 pack,
I got something that would make up for all
[SPEAKER_10]: of the shit they've ever sold me.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's one right there.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's how it was with us with Rugburn.
[SPEAKER_13]: We ran up through a bunch of Rugburn seeds
and every one of them was like,
[SPEAKER_13]: we got an eighth a piece off of them.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just like, this is the lankiest,
wonkiest looking.
[SPEAKER_13]: It smelled good.
[SPEAKER_13]: It looked good.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's just like, wow.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think Gage gets enough credit in
the game.
[SPEAKER_10]: More people need to notice Gage Green
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's definitely a high-end breeding
company that gets overlooked, in my
[SPEAKER_13]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_13]: I do.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're great breeders.
[SPEAKER_13]: They've got good material they're working
with.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: The material they have is golden.
[SPEAKER_13]: Joseph O.G.
[SPEAKER_13]: is amazing.
[SPEAKER_13]: It is.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can't deny it.
[SPEAKER_13]: You cannot deny it.
[SPEAKER_13]: The thing made Grape Stomper and so many
other great plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: The Joseph Ocean Beach Cross was one of
the highly sought after, but very quick
[SPEAKER_13]: and gone plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was coming and gone so fast because
it went out basically as testers and never
[SPEAKER_13]: came back.
[SPEAKER_13]: I may still have a pack of testers from
that.
[SPEAKER_10]: OB Rippers.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I might have some of those.
[SPEAKER_13]: From OB Rippers and us?
Maybe.
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly, I have a small manila envelope
filled with Gage Green Genetics tester
[SPEAKER_10]: packs because you just used to send me so
much.
[SPEAKER_10]: You'd be like, run what you can.
Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: We took the dominant oceans out of that
one, out of those and I actually bred with
[SPEAKER_13]: them too.
[SPEAKER_13]: We got a new one coming out with that.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a pre-98 Bubba Cross OB Ripper.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Joseph is just too stringy and I hate the
way he does that.
[SPEAKER_13]: We hit that pre-90.
[SPEAKER_13]: I caught Bay Pine.
[SPEAKER_13]: My prize mail is an Arise mail,
which was started with a Daybreaker mail
[SPEAKER_13]: from Gage.
[SPEAKER_13]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not afraid.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sad to admit that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've done dabs with them.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, those are good kids.
[SPEAKER_13]: They are.
[SPEAKER_13]: They are.
[SPEAKER_13]: We talked about it and you go to them with
a 10 pack and be like, hey, I got the Holy
[SPEAKER_13]: grail.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you mind if I breed it?
[SPEAKER_13]: They're going to look at you and key
player Mike's going to tell you,
[SPEAKER_13]: go for it.
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll help you name it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_13]: You got to have respect for that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of use anything that I breed to the
Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_10]: I try to use, I don't copy Gage,
but I use their scheme in the names like
[SPEAKER_10]: Arise and Cascade.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those were all crosses that came from the
Gage mail.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just try to honor them.
[SPEAKER_10]: In the cross.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: You got to give a little bit of props to
where it came from.
[SPEAKER_13]: Respect to the elders.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we did the Bay Pine.
[SPEAKER_13]: We put it in there, just the Bay Pine.
[SPEAKER_13]: California pine trees and it's where it's
from.
[SPEAKER_13]: So let's get a little homage back to
Callie.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Got to give love to everybody that does
it.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, you guys, we've been going for
like an hour.
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to start wrapping up this part of
the show.
[SPEAKER_10]: Will, you were a little bit quiet,
but we talked a lot about seed breeding.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I was here to learn.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys took me to school.
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope you learned a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_10]: I definitely did.
[SPEAKER_10]: You grew some Kalanji Kush from my seeds
and that shit looked amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually still have a mother from that
cut and I just am actually about to take a
[SPEAKER_11]: bunch of cuts this week.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I would definitely take one.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's better than the cut that I've
got.
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember you saying that a while back.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's better than the cut.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got the cut of green healthy and
your cut looks better.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like covered in trikes.
[SPEAKER_10]: One of my favorites to grow to.
[SPEAKER_10]: It often gets confused for La Plata Labs
Durango OG.
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks very similar.
[SPEAKER_11]: The smell on the Kalanji was, it was
something I had never smelled weed like
[SPEAKER_11]: that before.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone I showed it to was like,
what the hell, this is crazy.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: So definitely stoked on that one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good find.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: Man, where can people find you on social
media?
[SPEAKER_11]: You can find me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the, let me see if I'm underscored.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's the barefoot grower.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's barefoot underscore grower.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, the underscore barefoot underscore
grower.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really all I got going on.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you got pictures of the new grow at
work up there?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I work over at a SIN cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can find them on Instagram too.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just at a SIN cannabis company,
A-S-C-E-N-D.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_11]: That might be a new strain name,
a SIN.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was thinking about that the other day.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's messed up.
[SPEAKER_13]: That is messed up.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can have it, bro.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's yours.
[SPEAKER_13]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, obviously what made me think about it
was Arise.
[SPEAKER_13]: I swear straight up, dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, that's a good name for a
thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cause I go into Canna sewer a lot and they
run your Arise in there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: They actually, they actually- Really cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Canna sewer runs your Arise.
[SPEAKER_13]: Really?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's always on the show.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's one of the favorites of the
Budtenders in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, shout out to the Canna sewer,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to have to stop in there and buy
an eight just to see what it's like.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you know, the only reason why I ever
go into that place is because they're like
[SPEAKER_13]: the only place in Pueblo West that doesn't
just rape you.
[SPEAKER_13]: I can go in and get 125 ounces if I'm out
between harvests.
[SPEAKER_13]: The weed's crap, but you know- I was not
gonna ask.
[SPEAKER_13]: Step it up, guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just going to let you have that one.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just going to say it.
[SPEAKER_13]: The weed's crap.
[SPEAKER_13]: Quit using machines.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_10]: True machines suck.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hire people.
[SPEAKER_10]: Employ humans.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_13]: Support your community.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what's rude.
[SPEAKER_13]: Stop cutting it early.
[SPEAKER_13]: Quit doing machine work.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a lot of what the problem is.
[SPEAKER_13]: Once they do that, they got a fantastic
looking grow.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's clean.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, it looks good.
[SPEAKER_13]: They overfeed a little bit.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, when your plants look like
they're tying your shoes, it's time to
[SPEAKER_13]: back off a little bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of trimming weed, I owe a shout
out to my buddy John Randall Jr. That dude
[SPEAKER_10]: trims for 40 hours a week with no
complaints.
[SPEAKER_10]: Puts his head down and fucking cuts up
weed.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good job, brother.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate having you on the team.
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep it up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think?
[SPEAKER_10]: Will, did we cover all of your social
media?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: The underscore barefoot underscore grower.
[SPEAKER_10]: Make sure you support my friend Will.
[SPEAKER_10]: Check out his pictures.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's got some cool shit up there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think so too.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: For sure, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate your big ass grow.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love it over there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, post some cool shit on.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want these people to follow you on
Snapchat also?
[SPEAKER_10]: You know?
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think let's see what my Snapchat is.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's Illzweezy on Snapchat.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Snapchat's picky.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can find me as the barefoot grower on
Snapchat or Illzweezy on Snapchat.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're both my usernames.
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess you got two.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can see his morning dabs.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's always fun to watch.
[SPEAKER_11]: I stay on Snapchat during the day where I
post a lot of what we got going on over
[SPEAKER_11]: there.
[SPEAKER_11]: We do a lot every day.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you're interested in what goes on in
a huge greenhouse on the daily,
[SPEAKER_11]: definitely hit me up.
[SPEAKER_10]: It entertains me.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it will definitely entertain the
average grower.
[SPEAKER_10]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob, how can people find you on the social
media?
[SPEAKER_13]: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's pretty much where we're at right
now.
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys, the Sour Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_13]: You have a website yet?
[SPEAKER_13]: We had one.
[SPEAKER_13]: I took it down for a little while.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to redo everything.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just going to redo everything from
scratch again.
[SPEAKER_13]: And no more forum.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're just going to go all out.
[SPEAKER_13]: The forum gets to be a pain in the ass,
doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_13]: It does.
[SPEAKER_13]: It does.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then you have a lot of spam.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I have.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the main thing is the money.
[SPEAKER_13]: To get a good host that doesn't have a lot
of spam and security and everything else,
[SPEAKER_13]: it costs you a fortune.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Chinese and Russian hackers trying to get
into my forum every single day.
[SPEAKER_10]: They join the forum and then they just go
and they type in.
[SPEAKER_10]: In the forum, they figure out how to put
in script in their forum posts that can
[SPEAKER_10]: corrupt my website.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they start stealing shit out of
my website and then redirecting it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, this happened twice now,
but we're going to walk down pretty well
[SPEAKER_10]: now.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I feel like I just taunted people,
but please don't fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_13]: We had a great moderator, but it was a lot
on him too.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was like taking a path of his day.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I'm the moderator.
[SPEAKER_10]: I get the email, this is a hacker that's
registered to your forum and I have to go
[SPEAKER_10]: delete their account, block them,
delete all their posts.
[SPEAKER_13]: Shout out to Vinny for doing all that work
on our forum.
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, we shut it down.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're doing a website now and we do have a
website for the hat pins, 710hatpins.com.
[SPEAKER_10]: Check those guys out.
[SPEAKER_10]: He just brought me two dope ass hat pins.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got the little zombie pin doll and I got
the new Sour Seed Co logo for my hat.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to look fresh.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know where they're going to go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, check us out.
[SPEAKER_10]: We do $12.99 free shipping.
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't discriminate.
[SPEAKER_10]: All of our hat pins are the same.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you have more than three hat pins on
your hat, purse, and or backpack,
[SPEAKER_10]: you are a Wook.
[SPEAKER_10]: That is the official rule.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wook official, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Three pins is the limit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Three pins.
[SPEAKER_10]: We can all agree on three pins,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone looks too solid.
[SPEAKER_10]: Three is the limit.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: More than three pins and you're a Wook.
[SPEAKER_10]: Three.
[SPEAKER_10]: Three.
[SPEAKER_10]: Three makes you a Wook.
[SPEAKER_10]: Two pins, you're all right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Three, you are Wook.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have like 15 on my backpack right now,
but I make hat pins for them to have an
[SPEAKER_10]: excuse.
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got an excuse.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got the iRegenetics pin on everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I got that one in my frame.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's in my personal collection.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's where most of mine are on a frame.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think I have any on my hats,
actually.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just rocked the one on the hat.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all I need.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good enough.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I am a Wook.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll take care of that.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been going for a long time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Make sure you follow my friends on all
their social media feeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: Make sure you support 710 hat pins.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Make sure you support them.
[SPEAKER_10]: Support the legalization of cannabis and
make sure you follow me on all the social
[SPEAKER_10]: media, you guys.

the Grow From Your Heart podcast page.
[SPEAKER_10]: Support that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I'm going to wrap up this part
with my friends.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bros, thanks for coming.

play some music, and I'll be right back to
[SPEAKER_10]: wrap up the show.
Yeah.

[SPEAKER_10]: I hope we didn't give you just a whole
bunch of crap because we're both high and
[SPEAKER_10]: we rambled a lot, but hashtag they like it
when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cut the time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of answered his question.
[SPEAKER_09]: The Fred's main problem that I foresee is
going to be there's a reason he's running
[SPEAKER_09]: at night.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if he's lucky, it's just economics.
[SPEAKER_10]: They go off at 6 a.m.
[SPEAKER_10]: So leave them off.
[SPEAKER_10]: They would normally come back on at 6 p.m.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't turn them on then.
[SPEAKER_10]: Leave them off until the sun comes back up
around 6, dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_10]: Figure out when the sun comes up that day.
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're only going to be off for 24
hours because he's turning them off at 6 a
[SPEAKER_10]: .m.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I'm saying, Fred.
[SPEAKER_09]: What I was getting at is like people run
at night for temperature reasons.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a lot easier to cool your room at
night.
[SPEAKER_09]: And sometimes in some places power's
cheaper.
[SPEAKER_10]: And some people have day jobs and have to
grow wheat at night.
Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: But depending on what Fred's reasons are
for going at night, he is definitely going
[SPEAKER_09]: to have some work to figure out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some adjusting.
[SPEAKER_10]: About a 36 hour window there to figure it
out.
[SPEAKER_10]: So cut the timer.
[SPEAKER_10]: Get them on the same schedule as the
outside if you can.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the best I could tell you for that
part.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then start taking them outside slowly or
cut them off for 36 hours and then take
[SPEAKER_10]: them outside if that's what you have to
do.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then if you need to put them in the
hoop house to get them dark, do that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if not, I think you'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I could be wrong to be totally honest.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think about 13, 14 hours you should
be getting enough nighttime photo period
[SPEAKER_10]: for those plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: But be careful.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's so many variables in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fred, I hope we answered your question.
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope we helped you out.
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope I get a couple of packs of those
seeds when you get finished with this
[SPEAKER_10]: project.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fred, thanks for the support.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for listening so much.
[SPEAKER_10]: You've been following me for a long time
on social media.
[SPEAKER_10]: You've been listening to the show since I
think you got a prize on episode 50.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how long ago that was now that I'm
thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it 50 when we gave away a whole bunch
of stuff?
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it was 50.
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it 50 or 100?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it was number 100.
[SPEAKER_10]: We had everybody here and we just got
crazy to talk forever.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was 50.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was 50.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think Fred got a prize in that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's how long Fred's been supporting
us.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks a lot, brother.
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks, Fred.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for interacting.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you have a follow-up question to our
rambles, please send it to me the same way
[SPEAKER_10]: that you sent this one and I'll check it
out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to move on to the next part of
the show.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got an email from a friend who has a
problem.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me just read the email.
[SPEAKER_10]: He says, Hey Rasta, love the show.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe you can help me recover from a huge
mistake.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I may have mislabeled two
different plants when I was cloning them.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now I think five are Alaskan Thunderfuck
and five are Master Kush.
[SPEAKER_10]: How should I go about making sure I clone
and properly label said plants?
[SPEAKER_10]: Then he says, should I take a clone of
each plant and label them mom and clone
[SPEAKER_10]: with a certain tag and do all 10?
[SPEAKER_10]: Or should I make more than one clone of
each?
[SPEAKER_10]: I know after I clone, I need to toss the
moms into bloom after I see roots.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it sounds like this dude had a mother
plant and took clones, took 10 clones and
[SPEAKER_10]: may have mislabeled those 10 clones.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's hoping he took five and five and lost
all 10 labels is basically what I'm
[SPEAKER_09]: getting, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm hoping he at least had the mother
plants out properly and took five and
[SPEAKER_10]: five.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm hoping that that went proper.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't even think about that part when I
read the question.
[SPEAKER_09]: The real answer to this is proper labeling
from the get go and how each grower goes
[SPEAKER_09]: about that is wildly different.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'll give him my advice and props
for admitting that you may have made a
[SPEAKER_10]: mistake, but in your pothead mind,
you probably did it just fine and you're
[SPEAKER_10]: paranoid.
[SPEAKER_10]: He asks, first of all, now I think five
are this and five are this.
[SPEAKER_10]: How should I go about making sure I clone
and properly label said plants?
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Take all 10 of those plants and set them
in a straight line of a row and then grab
[SPEAKER_10]: one plant, the one that's in the front of
the row and take that to an area and get
[SPEAKER_10]: some white duct tape and write A on that
one and then cut as many clones as you can
[SPEAKER_10]: cut from it without killing that plant and
label all of those clones very clearly.
[SPEAKER_10]: However, if you cut them into rapid
rooters, if you cut them into an easy
[SPEAKER_10]: cloner, label them A and then take that
plant that's labeled A and put it
[SPEAKER_10]: somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, go get the next plant that's in that
straight line filled with plants and carry
[SPEAKER_10]: it over to the cloning area.
[SPEAKER_10]: Get that white duct tape, write a B on
there and label that motherfucker B and
[SPEAKER_10]: then take as many clones as you can get
off of plant that is now a number B,
[SPEAKER_10]: get as many clones as you can and label
them carefully B.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what you got to do, I think,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's what's got to happen.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all in setting it up from the get go.
[SPEAKER_09]: I used to help a dude clone 100,
200 clones at a time from six,
[SPEAKER_09]: eight, 10 different strains and everything
got labeled.
[SPEAKER_09]: When they're in that obnoxious little pup
10 cloner, we'd cut little slivers out of
[SPEAKER_09]: a solo cup and use those as little label
pegs to go in next to the plug.
[SPEAKER_09]: Other people use really cool little
labels.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those little just plant label sticks.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just use those and write on those and
stick them in the neoprene is how I do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen ones that look like,
it almost looks like a little flag that
[SPEAKER_09]: you would stick in like a sandwich or
something, like a toothpick that stick
[SPEAKER_09]: right in the plugs that make it real easy.
[SPEAKER_09]: How cute.
[SPEAKER_09]: But keeping your labels good from the get
goes the best way here.
[SPEAKER_09]: As long as you make sure you've got a
healthy clone from your mother,
[SPEAKER_09]: when you flower that out, you'll be able
to tell, oh, this one's more cushy,
[SPEAKER_09]: this one's more like the last one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, yeah, hopefully within four or five
to six weeks, you'll know which is which.
[SPEAKER_09]: And as long as you go ahead and get your
labels right when you clone next,
[SPEAKER_09]: you'll know for sure, okay, these clones
are definitely from plant A, these clones
[SPEAKER_09]: are definitely from plant B.
[SPEAKER_09]: Once you finally finish it out,
you'll know, okay, plant A was the
[SPEAKER_10]: Alaskan, plant B was- And what you can do,
so once you're going to take cuts,
[SPEAKER_10]: right, and you're going to have hopefully
three, I like to take three cuts.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got OCD that works in groups of
threes.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I take three cuts and then take mother
plant A, mother plant B, line them back up
[SPEAKER_10]: in the grow room all pretty, let your
clones root.
[SPEAKER_10]: As soon as you see roots on there,
put them into their next stage,
[SPEAKER_10]: which is usually a cup for me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some people use a little one gallon pot,
whatever you want to do, put it in the
[SPEAKER_10]: next step and then take that one that you
cut the clone from.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's already grown, it's already big.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just go flower that one.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's what the plan called for.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think he just wants to make sure he gets
his genetics reserved.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, toss the moms into bloom after I see
roots.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think you figured out what you got to
do.
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to take clones from every one of
them.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the best part is now you're going
to have a bunch of clones to grow next
[SPEAKER_10]: time.
Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're not sure at this point what
you're about to flower out is,
[SPEAKER_09]: and you're not a hundred percent sure
you've got its genetics preserved in a
[SPEAKER_09]: healthy clone, just go ahead and take
another clone and then give it,
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you only have to give it a few
days.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you only take three clones,
four clones off of it, unless your mother
[SPEAKER_09]: plant is really like- Well, I don't know
if you still got a mother plant,
[SPEAKER_10]: like the original mom that these five of
each clones came from.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know where that is in this story.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm just assuming he doesn't have that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm assuming all he's got are these 10
clones and he's going to figure out what-
[SPEAKER_09]: Could easily be that way.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully there's five and five.
[SPEAKER_09]: I watched you clone a nugget you were
handed once.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't tell people all the crazy shit I
did.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you've still got the plant alive,
you can preserve the genetics if you must.
[SPEAKER_10]: We were at a garden and somebody was
trying to be nice and blessed me by
[SPEAKER_10]: cutting off a fresh little tiny bottom
bud.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're like, try that out and check
it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause I wasn't going to see the guy for a
while and I wasn't going to get a chance
[SPEAKER_10]: to taste the medicine when it finished.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he gave me, it still had leaves on it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It still was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was fresh off the bud.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're driving and Mike said,
you know what you should do is you should
[SPEAKER_10]: try to clone that because it was a plant
that we really wished we had.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it worked.
[SPEAKER_10]: It worked.
[SPEAKER_10]: I cloned it and it took a long time to
revert that bud back into a usable plant,
[SPEAKER_10]: but I was able to clone that plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: We had that strain around for,
it was kind of a fucking mutant of it,
[SPEAKER_10]: but the bud was very similar.
[SPEAKER_10]: The flavor, but it still looked the same.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I did clone a flowered bud.
[SPEAKER_10]: It took a long time to revert it.
[SPEAKER_10]: The leaves did a bunch of spirally weird,
twisty shit, but yeah, I've done some
[SPEAKER_10]: crazy things.
[SPEAKER_10]: So dude, what you got to do, I'm going to
recap and then we're going to move on.
[SPEAKER_10]: Take clones from all of them.
[SPEAKER_10]: As many clones as you can afford to take
space wise and without murdering that
[SPEAKER_10]: plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then while you're taking those clones,
carefully shape that plant into something
[SPEAKER_10]: that would flower nicely.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then carry those to the flower room when
you see roots and flower the shit out of
[SPEAKER_10]: them.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my advice.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, thank you for the question.
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope I helped you out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Next time label more carefully,
but don't be afraid to admit that you make
[SPEAKER_10]: some mistakes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Please continue to send me emails,
keep me updated on this, how this goes.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you hit me up on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like thanks for following me on
there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Guys, if you want to follow me on
Instagram, it's irey underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now today, something cool happened in the
state of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_10]: Something very cool happened.
[SPEAKER_10]: Something very cool happened.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you don't live here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah, if you live here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I wrote down a list of pros and I
want to see if there's a list of cons that
[SPEAKER_10]: you can come up with once we talk about
this.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: So today, the Colorado MED stated that,
does it start today?
[SPEAKER_09]: I was told it started today.
[SPEAKER_10]: Starting today.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, then by the time this recording
comes out, it will have already started.
[SPEAKER_09]: They didn't change this rule.
[SPEAKER_09]: This rule was changed in the legislature,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I'm not mistaken, the legislature's
wrote it, passed it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was signed by the governor and the MED
implemented it today.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't even think this was going to
pass.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a really, really, really nice,
nice little gift to the industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've just built up so much suspense that
we should tell everybody what happened.
Guess what happened?
Guess what happened, you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's starting today.
[SPEAKER_10]: Today is July, June 16th while we travel.
[SPEAKER_10]: June 16th?
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait.
[SPEAKER_10]: June 15th.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, thank Christ.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the 16th.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's the, well, it's after midnight is
why I'm tripping.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say, I've got an
anniversary like my niana.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just about to fuck that up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Happy anniversary, Jen.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hope you're listening.
[SPEAKER_10]: She probably isn't.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, she's sleeping.
[SPEAKER_10]: It happened on the 15th.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're now recording after midnight.
[SPEAKER_10]: Midnight has passed.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it started on the 15th.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're rambling today, guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: We blame that on bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: So as of today, out of state shoppers in a
dispensary, before today, let's rewind,
[SPEAKER_10]: before today, out of state shoppers were
limited to seven grams of raw cannabis on
[SPEAKER_10]: their purchase.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now those same shoppers, folks who are
over 21 and have an ID that can prove so,
[SPEAKER_10]: if they're from out of state, they are
able to purchase one ounce of cannabis
[SPEAKER_10]: product.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like a statey.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like someone that lives here.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can walk in and buy one ounce.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, fuck that native sticker.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you're equals.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now we're all equals.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can come here and buy just the same
amount of marijuana as anybody else.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you're allowed to possess it.
[SPEAKER_10]: The only problem is there's still nowhere
to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's still an issue.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's nearly gone.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was another rule that was,
it was passed last November.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was supposed to go into effect in
January and they kicked it down the road
[SPEAKER_09]: till October that was going to restrict
out of state folks, edible wise.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're going to crank down those
limits quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think all that just went out the
window.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love it when they toss shit out.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what did pass was no more gummy
bears, no more gummy bears, no more
[SPEAKER_10]: edibles, no more cannabis infused edibles
shaped like gummy bears.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not just gummy bears.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's no more edible shaped like fruit
shapes, animals, people.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's another one.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically anything that like is currently
on the market other than squares and
[SPEAKER_09]: triangles.
[SPEAKER_10]: They just don't want the kids to be
encouraged by a great shape.
[SPEAKER_09]: On the same day that particular,
the edible restriction bill was signed.
[SPEAKER_09]: The governor signed another bill to put
hard liquor in grocery stores.
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw that.
[SPEAKER_10]: On the same day.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can buy whiskey and tequila at
Walmart.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be gradual.
[SPEAKER_09]: So for the next couple of years,
it'll just be wine.
[SPEAKER_10]: You mean I'll be able to buy a gun.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll be able to buy a gun and a bottle of
whiskey at the right superstore at the
[SPEAKER_10]: right Walmart, Pablo West.
[SPEAKER_09]: At the right Walmart, you will be able to
get a gun and hard liquor and frozen pizza
[SPEAKER_09]: and the new Xbox America all at once while
your oil is getting changed and you're
[SPEAKER_09]: getting your glasses.
[SPEAKER_10]: And doing your banking and taking pictures
of sweet mullets.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully you're searching for mullets
while you're at Walmart.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you can find somebody, all right guys,
challenge.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want a picture of somebody in their
pajamas with a mullet at a Walmart.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know I want it to be your photo.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't fucking internet me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't Google this shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: An extra small, slightly dirty Irish
shirt.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I don't have any shirts I can offer
because they're all at the store.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll send you some stickers.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some stickers.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got stickers all day long.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't guarantee what they'll be,
but they'll be cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fucking stickers.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll send you, I'll stuff an envelope with
what I think will, they'll look at me
[SPEAKER_10]: like, bro, you need to pay extra shipping.
[SPEAKER_10]: When I send these stickers, I'll stuff an
envelope.
[SPEAKER_10]: So here's the task.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pajamas, mullet at Walmart.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want you to send it to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can just tweet it to me at GFYH
podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tweet it to me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then hashtag it mullet challenge.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to write that down because
that's fucking epic right there.
[SPEAKER_09]: If Fred wins this one too, I'm going to be
a little ashamed of some of the other
[SPEAKER_09]: listeners.
[SPEAKER_10]: Legitimately broke that down.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do they have Walmart in Australia?
[SPEAKER_09]: Is Seb going to have to drive like 600
miles to attempt this challenge?
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're in another country, if you're in
a place that doesn't have Walmart.
[SPEAKER_09]: We will email you pictures of stickers
Seb.
[SPEAKER_10]: Seb, I can't mail you stickers,
dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're in Australia and that's going to be
so expensive.
[SPEAKER_10]: I researched how much it would cost to
send them a shirt and the shipping was
[SPEAKER_10]: just more than what the shirts are even
worth.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, no, dude, no, I'm not going to
do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just, I looked up what it takes to send
stuff to Costa Rica recently and I was
[SPEAKER_09]: like, that ain't getting pictures of the
kid.
[SPEAKER_09]: That can use Facebook.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to have to be good enough.
[SPEAKER_10]: So at least you can man.
[SPEAKER_10]: United States citizens only and the
continental United States are qualified
[SPEAKER_10]: for this.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, bud.
[SPEAKER_10]: I tried.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just, I can't be shipping shit across
the world.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad we were able to disappoint you
now and not after you drove six hours to
[SPEAKER_09]: the Walmart.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, mate.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, a mullet challenge you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mullet.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to see some good mullets.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pajamas.
[SPEAKER_10]: Walmart.
[SPEAKER_10]: I could probably drive seven minutes and
find that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I bet that's happening right up the
street.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right up the street.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want to put this podcast back on
some rails?
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been all over the place since we
started.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what's even happening.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love you too listeners.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes I mean, but you know,
I love you.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's not that.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's just, man, he's an asshole.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes I mean, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: So now if you're coming from out of state,
you can now purchase an ounce of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can buy an ounce people.
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome to the club.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: No more plastic chairs, little plastic
table at dinner for you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now you don't have to drive to four
different dispensaries to have an ounce of
[SPEAKER_09]: weed or run to your car four times.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was getting so old.
[SPEAKER_09]: When we made him drive around the store,
it legitimately caused traffic issues.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think people are going to try to do
that and buy more ounces?
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think that's going to happen?
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you said you wanted a list of the
benefits and the cons.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's the con.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the dipshit from two states over
that comes here, drops his monthly
[SPEAKER_09]: paycheck, drives all that home and flips
it a couple of times a year.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's going to get a little,
or at least has the potential to get a
[SPEAKER_09]: little worse.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the more of those idiots that get
caught, the worse we look, the more heat
[SPEAKER_09]: on us.
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't need any more black eyes right
now.
[SPEAKER_10]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_10]: He said black eyes, by the way.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: Black eyes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to clear that up.
[SPEAKER_09]: The cannabis industry is under a lot of
fire right now, honestly.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we can't keep our best foot
forward, we're going to be past tense here
[SPEAKER_09]: in three or four years instead of bigger
and better than ever.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very, very true.
[SPEAKER_10]: Guys, quit shipping stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't ship you anything.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't ask.
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw three or four posts this week on
social media of people saying just
[SPEAKER_09]: straight up, stop fucking asking.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to mail you anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to send you anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to sleep with you for weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just the most obnoxious shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just knock it off.
[SPEAKER_09]: None of that exists here anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got rid of all of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just go to the store and you point at the
jar you like and you buy a bunch of weed,
[SPEAKER_10]: and then you go home and puff.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: But every time another package gets caught
in the mail or another putz from another
[SPEAKER_09]: state gets caught with 300 plants in his
backyard going, but I thought weed was
[SPEAKER_09]: legal here.
[SPEAKER_09]: The whole industry takes a huge hit.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we take enough of those,
we're done.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I really like my job, people.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you get that inflection
over the radio.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love my job.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even with all the crap I have to deal with
because of it, I don't want to go do
[SPEAKER_09]: drywall again.
[SPEAKER_09]: I really like this.
[SPEAKER_10]: I really like being able to grow cannabis
on a large scale without having to watch
[SPEAKER_10]: over my shoulder all day.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm done working with jailbroken
teenagers.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I work in the cannabis industry now.
[SPEAKER_09]: I swear to God, if you fuck this up,
I will be famous for being an ax murderer,
[SPEAKER_09]: chasing down all the idiots who ruined it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those statements are only supported by
white Mike, not the opinions of the
[SPEAKER_10]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just so obnoxious watching people
fuck this up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's talk about some of the pros then.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the pros, this is huge for
out-of-staters.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can buy an ounce just like a big boy.
[SPEAKER_09]: For shops, it makes life so much easier
for me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can stop counting to seven.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like half my day as a bud tender.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like one, two, three, four, five,
six.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_09]: One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to have to do two
transactions, sir.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to have to run out your car.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that's the rule.
[SPEAKER_09]: Deal with it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just seven.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all you get.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have ludicrous metaphors to just shut
people up immediately with, oh,
[SPEAKER_09]: this is ludicrous.
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you guys?
[SPEAKER_09]: Just shut up.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to have that conversation.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got sentences to just shut it down,
but we get rid of all of that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope they leave the edibles and the
concentrates purchase limits alone and
[SPEAKER_09]: that those don't end up still getting
cranked down in November.
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes stuff so much easier on us.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're the only industry on the planet
where you can't buy what you can pay for.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you think about what purchase limits
actually mean and where they apply
[SPEAKER_09]: elsewhere in the world, it's just nuts.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think something that's helpful is naked.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can try more variety before you'd go
and you'd get an eighth of that and an
[SPEAKER_10]: eighth of that, and then that's what you
got to smoke on.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you can get a real variety without
just drawing the price on you.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you get seven grams instead of two
eighths or a quarter, you pay a lot more.
[SPEAKER_09]: You miss out on all the price breaks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: So picking up four eighths is a lot better
economically than picking up seven grams
[SPEAKER_09]: split four ways per gram.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like buy miles.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you get more herb.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's one of the advantages.
[SPEAKER_10]: More weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fewer trips to the weed store.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, fewer trips.
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to go to and from the dispensary
less times.
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to go stand in line.
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't have to deal with that dickhead
security guard as many times.
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't have to pull out your ID and
your card and sit there and wait,
[SPEAKER_10]: and then go hit the ATM and pull out money
as many times and then go see some person
[SPEAKER_10]: that doesn't really want to deal with you
asking questions.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, your butt senders have to do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm happy with questions.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or if they're not, find a better shop.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And tip them.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tip your butt sender.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: If your butt sender is good, tip your butt
sender.
[SPEAKER_09]: They worked really hard.
[SPEAKER_09]: They gave you a lot of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then of course, if your legal limit is
an ounce, why can't we buy an ounce?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, duh, that seems weird.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't make me go to four places to get my
legal limit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you just trying to make me shop at
four different places?
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: And do you think places are going to lose
business because the guys that are going
[SPEAKER_10]: to buy, there are obviously people that
come from out of town.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or out of state to do this.
[SPEAKER_10]: They come and they just buy stuff to go
to.
[SPEAKER_09]: The second shop that was like shop A gets
hit first.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like their favorite shop, the shop that
has the best price or the best selection,
[SPEAKER_09]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_09]: So now does shop B lose three quarters?
[SPEAKER_09]: Shop B loses at least a second visit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or does he go to shop B and buy a whole
other ounce?
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause now it's that much easier.
[SPEAKER_09]: It really, I think the people that were
doing that anyway, cause a lot of shops
[SPEAKER_09]: allowed you to make four visits.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they just made four visits at A,
made four visits at B, or went to A,
[SPEAKER_09]: went to B, went to A, went to B,
went to A.
[SPEAKER_09]: We would have people bitch about like how
far apart we were from the others from
[SPEAKER_09]: time to time in the butt room.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're like, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: Making the drive one more time,
getting, getting a little dizzy.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, dude, quit being a douche.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't tell us about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, so we've got a little list of
pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm really happy this rule passed.
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes my life simpler.
[SPEAKER_09]: It has the potential to increase business
a little bit, but not, not dramatically.
[SPEAKER_10]: To the people, to the better dispensaries
that like we were talking about,
[SPEAKER_10]: maybe that second and third tier
dispensary, you're going to lose that
[SPEAKER_10]: second quarter that would have gotten
sold.
[SPEAKER_10]: If the guy had money for a half,
he's probably just going to buy that whole
[SPEAKER_10]: half ounce at the goods shop.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, if he was going to buy an ounce,
he's going to buy it all there.
[SPEAKER_09]: The other little downside is everyone that
moved here for marijuana had a big
[SPEAKER_09]: incentive to go get their ID changed.
[SPEAKER_09]: When they went to the DMV and got their ID
changed, they got registered to vote.
[SPEAKER_09]: We make that very easy here.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's going to slow down just a
little bit, I think.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just another little negative in the
negative column piece.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's not a lot of negatives to this.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't think of how that went as long as
Texans don't torpedo it for us.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I'm, I'm really happy about this,
but yeah, I've pretty much everyone I
[SPEAKER_09]: talked to that moved here for marijuana is
like, yep, get my ID switched.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: Got registered to vote for you in
November.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like that's pretty helpful.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't even think of that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause I've been a resident for so long
that I never thought about how to switch
[SPEAKER_10]: my ID.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you're not dealing with the crowd at
the door.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I am.
[SPEAKER_09]: The people I talked to were, are inquiring
about how to go medical.
[SPEAKER_09]: You work for a medical dispensary in the
grow even.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're not even handling patients.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I go there occasionally and drop off
product and I go purchase my own products,
[SPEAKER_10]: but I spend very little time there,
but I see patients come and go.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I see the first wave when they get
here, basically, I think they just enacted
[SPEAKER_10]: a new rule.
[SPEAKER_10]: It starts either the first, it starts on
the 1st of July.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that if you are trying to use your
extended plant count at a medical
[SPEAKER_10]: facility, you have to be a member of that
facility.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, is that an official rule?
[SPEAKER_09]: I knew that was the policy that a lot of
shops had.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: They've made an official rule is what I
think I saw on the door at one of the
[SPEAKER_10]: stores.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're really looking to crack down
on some, some of the abuses that can take
[SPEAKER_09]: place in the medical market.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going overboard in my opinion,
but like they've had it, they've cut
[SPEAKER_09]: enough really shady shit that like,
I'm not surprised the regulators are
[SPEAKER_09]: pissing, cracking down.
[SPEAKER_10]: Colorado people with the medical card,
if that shit's getting close to expiring,
[SPEAKER_10]: go renew it because it's taking a long
time for my renewal to come in.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And here's what sucks.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't shop if you don't have your
actual card.
[SPEAKER_10]: If your old card, you can only go get your
new card 30 days before your old card
[SPEAKER_10]: expires.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't renew within 30 days of the old
one expiring, but it takes about 45 days
[SPEAKER_10]: for your new card to come in the mail and
you're not allowed to shop in a dispensary
[SPEAKER_10]: until you have that new permanent card in
the mail.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's going to be about it right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been a couple of week gap before I've
been able to shop.
[SPEAKER_09]: Depending on how you plan for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It can be a nasty gap.
[SPEAKER_09]: I see those people too.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got a regular doctor that I go to for
my MMJ recommendation and I've got to
[SPEAKER_10]: schedule an appointment and he's been so
busy.
[SPEAKER_10]: It took me several days to get in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I couldn't get in as quick as I wanted to.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it was about two weeks.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that put me two more weeks behind and
then, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that puts me six weeks out and then
it's taking about eight weeks,
[SPEAKER_10]: I think.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I need a card.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_10]: I grow.
[SPEAKER_10]: I do my thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Luckily I'm stocked up.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll be all right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Life is good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Life is never bad.
[SPEAKER_10]: Life's always good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Life's what you make of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're having a shitty time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Take a fad dab and fix it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice fad dab will fix just about any day.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mike, we've been going for about 40
minutes.
[SPEAKER_10]: We covered some good points.
[SPEAKER_10]: We did some educating.
[SPEAKER_10]: We had cannabis news.
[SPEAKER_10]: We had cannabis education and we certainly
had- A lot of cannabis conversation.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cannabis conversation.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we fucking nailed it on this one.
[SPEAKER_09]: We really did.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's three for three people.
[SPEAKER_09]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some round of applause for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: High five across the table, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: We nailed that shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: We literally did high five, you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was no bullshit.
[SPEAKER_10]: I barely heard that through my headphones.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's really high-end sound equipment,
folks.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a compressor.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I got some compression on there.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was really, really, really nice gear.
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't sound as butter sweet in person.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've had people recognize me.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was at the Mystic Root Show the other
day and somebody goes, you look familiar.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I go, I work at the Green and Healthy
Wellness.
[SPEAKER_10]: I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_10]: And she's like, nope.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I go, I do a podcast about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: And she goes, oh my God, that voice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I said it like, I do a podcast all
about cannabis, just being a smart ass.
[SPEAKER_10]: And she's like, I recognize your voice.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you still listen, shout out.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you do, but shout out.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was good seeing you.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: What else we got?
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we got some shout outs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Mike, thanks for joining me,
bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: How do my friends that are listening
follow you on social media?
[SPEAKER_09]: You can find me at Nemopunk15 on Twitter
and you can find me at Pueblo for Sensible
[SPEAKER_09]: Cannabis Laws on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws on

[SPEAKER_10]: Click like.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Comment positive stuff on there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Support what we, they are trying to do.
[SPEAKER_10]: I put myself in that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_10]: Support what Mike is trying to do.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mike is probably the leading cannabis
activist that I am aware of in this area.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen you team up with a few other
cool people.
[SPEAKER_10]: So shout out to you guys for doing all
that for us.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're getting a nice little team put
together for this response effort to the
[SPEAKER_09]: group trying to ban us.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be a really funny year for
me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I might sleep through all the 2017 at this
pace though, because I'm kind of running
[SPEAKER_09]: myself ragged.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you've got a little kid, so don't.
[SPEAKER_09]: I really might.
[SPEAKER_09]: I might just throw down every penny I make
this year to pay somebody else to keep
[SPEAKER_09]: them alive for until I wake up from my
coma.
[SPEAKER_10]: When you have a child sometimes.
[SPEAKER_10]: When you're sleeping, you're dreaming
about sleeping.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like a dick all the times I said I
was tired before, like the last 10 months.
[SPEAKER_09]: I almost want to go back and apologize to
the people with kids that I was talking to
[SPEAKER_09]: and I was like, man, I'm too tired.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want me to work today.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they just gave me the look that I give
people in their twenties now and they say
[SPEAKER_09]: that shit at work.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, yeah, it's crazy people.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're savages at Argrove.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I understand how you're feeling about
being tired.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm doing like 40 a week.
[SPEAKER_09]: It work in another 20 a week on the
campaign.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I've got a 10 month old that I
play with for like at least 30 hours a
[SPEAKER_09]: week.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I sleep for like three, five,
eight hours a day.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I'm lucky, I was going to say some of
those, some of those play hours are
[SPEAKER_09]: random.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes you expect it to be asleep two
in the morning.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're up playing on the floor and he's in
his bounce chair just going off.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's like, dude, it's quarter to
three.
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_10]: He's going to be like us when he gets
older, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: For some reason, Mike and I are both night
owls.
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought it was great when we both
discovered that we both like to be fucking
[SPEAKER_10]: doing whatever happens.
[SPEAKER_10]: We used to build crows and people were
like, when can you come do this?
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we show up at like midnight?
[SPEAKER_10]: And they think we're fucking crazy,
but we'd just crush and grow out while
[SPEAKER_10]: everybody else was gone and build it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they'd show up in the morning and be
like, wow, a grow.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or the night we trim somebody's crop for
them until the sun came up.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they woke up and had several pounds
trim that weren't trimmed the night
[SPEAKER_10]: before.
[SPEAKER_10]: His wife made me leave.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go home, get some rest.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, guys, thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to Elevate Glass.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to Toke Radio.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to my friend, Jessica.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see, who else?
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's all I wrote down for shout
outs.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, shout out to your recent guests.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love the last episode with the barefoot
blower.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, Will.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't know that was going to stick so
well.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was going to stick, bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Great show.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've really liked the last couple.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Rob from Sour Seeds.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't forget Rob from Sour.
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob knows a lot about breeding.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why I tried to bring him on for the
breeding podcast.
[SPEAKER_09]: I always love it when other people are on.
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes me really wish that I was here to
record that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it makes me want to be a better
guest.
[SPEAKER_09]: So great job, yo.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hear that, guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mike is trying to be a better guest.

violence this show?

an axe murderer at some point in the show.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that was my personal.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just where I see my life going.
[SPEAKER_09]: If idiots screw up legalization.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just, I don't know.

[SPEAKER_06]: Any old kind of way
[SPEAKER_06]: was right.

long.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't have to make sure the mood is right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Be a day or night.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let your mind take flight.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pack it in a boot up on about two feet
long.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't have to make sure the mood is right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pack it in a boot up on about two feet
long.
[SPEAKER_10]: Make you feel so right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pack it in a boot up on about two feet
long.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't have to make sure the mood is right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pack it in a boot up on about two feet
long.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pack it in a boot up on about two feet
long.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't have to make sure the mood is right.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this podcast might have been doing
this, it might have been Mike's idea for
us.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mike might have accidentally scheduled
this for us.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes a plan just comes together.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like it when it works.
[SPEAKER_10]: So a couple of nights ago I was chilling
out really quickly.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to my friends at Elevate Glass,
a 517 South Teahant in Colorado Springs,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_10]: Guys if you need a smoking accessories of
any sort.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody in this room has been there,
I think Mike's been there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Did I take you with me?
[SPEAKER_10]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think I've been to Elevate.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just lied to our listeners.
[SPEAKER_10]: I apologize for misleading you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mike will be at Elevate very soon.
[SPEAKER_10]: But Lindsay's been there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very affordable, high quality glass,
and super lovely ladies.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a reason that the listeners don't
know about my awesome rig and it's because
[SPEAKER_09]: it don't exist yet.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, then we got to take you to Elevate
one day.
[SPEAKER_09]: I throw all my rig money at my kid right
now, but I've got a little stash going and
[SPEAKER_09]: it's only a matter of time before I'm up
there getting something nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've got something affordable for you.
[SPEAKER_10]: This one is 200 bucks.
[SPEAKER_10]: The banger is only 20 bucks.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Talk to them, tell them you listen to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: They might make something happen for you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, affordable rigs are awesome
rigs.
[SPEAKER_10]: So shout out to my friends at Elevate
Glass.
[SPEAKER_10]: Big shout out to everybody over there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: Big hugs, fist bumps all around.
[SPEAKER_10]: 517 South Tejon, support that.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can get a carb cap, you can get a
banger, you can get a new rig,
[SPEAKER_10]: you can get a recycler, you can get a case
for your rig, you can get some stickers,
[SPEAKER_10]: you can get some heady jewelry.
[SPEAKER_10]: All kinds of good shit in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get to the point of the show,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even know where this idea came
from.
[SPEAKER_10]: I sent Mike a text message.
[SPEAKER_10]: I said, hey dude, let's do a podcast about
dispensary etiquette.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mike is a budtender at a recreational
dispensary in Pueblo West Colorado.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anybody 21 and over is allowed to shop in
that dispensary.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you've got an ID, excuse me,
an ID, a passport, what else works?
[SPEAKER_10]: Valid USI issued ID.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: That says you're 21 and over?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then you're able to go in there and buy an
ounce of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_10]: An ounce for anyone now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Lindsay works in a medical cannabis
facility in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Colorado Springs does not support any
recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: They only have medical, so you can only
shop medically.
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to have your purple card.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it sounds so weird.
[SPEAKER_10]: It used to be a red card, but now you have
to have your purple card.
[SPEAKER_10]: So they've both got very similar
experiences yet very different experiences
[SPEAKER_10]: as budtenders.
[SPEAKER_10]: Lindsay is the dreadlocked budtender at
Green and Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_10]: So when you're there, give her a shout
out, say what's up, let her know that you
[SPEAKER_10]: heard about her on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: Give her a fist bump.
[SPEAKER_10]: If she's super busy, just say,
hey, I listened to you on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let her move on because she's got shit to
do, but she's not busy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Make sure you say hi to her.
[SPEAKER_10]: Support your budtenders.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Mike is a budtender in Pueblo West.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you see him tending bud for you,
give him a fist bump.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tell him I heard about you on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, say hi folks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mike was my budtender at the spot on my
birthday.
[SPEAKER_08]: My one and only time I've ever gone into
the spot and bought something,
[SPEAKER_08]: Mike was my budtender.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: See, that could be you people.
See?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_09]: Was he nice to you?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, he was.
[SPEAKER_08]: He actually gave me a free t-shirt for my
birthday.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to say birthday shirt.
[SPEAKER_10]: Was he informative?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you go back based on your experience
with Mike?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're so silly.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was trolling you a little bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_08]: You come in all the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was like, oh Jesus.
[SPEAKER_10]: But you're wonderful to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're friends.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't come in and annoy you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not like, can I smell this jar?
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I smell this jar?
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I smell this jar?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I don't have any money.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to smell jars.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm out.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not that guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: So is that the first one on the list?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that's a great way to start.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's do some introduction.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to talk, I don't think I even
talked about what the, did your headphones
[SPEAKER_10]: get out?
[SPEAKER_10]: I see you pointing at your ear.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll just keep tapping until they come
back in.
[SPEAKER_10]: Any better?
[SPEAKER_10]: No?
[SPEAKER_10]: No.
[SPEAKER_10]: No minor cut now.
[SPEAKER_10]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_10]: Did it work?
[SPEAKER_10]: You had it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right about here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then this one is Lindsey.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this working?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll just quit touching it.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_09]: This piece of gear.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fading in and out, right to left now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Really bro?
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what you did to me,
bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I was perfect till that happened.
[SPEAKER_10]: How about this?
[SPEAKER_10]: Bump, bump, bump.
[SPEAKER_10]: We good?
[SPEAKER_10]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Headphone check.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry listeners.
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope your headphones are working as
well.
[SPEAKER_10]: We might be able to edit.
[SPEAKER_10]: And probably not.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry folks.
[SPEAKER_10]: That little box is evil.
[SPEAKER_10]: This will go live to drive.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to do a podcast that is
about dispensary etiquette.
[SPEAKER_10]: How a dispensary shopper should conduct
themselves properly to not make themselves
[SPEAKER_10]: look like an asshole and not to annoy the
fuck out of the dispensary workers.
[SPEAKER_10]: So both my friends work in dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got a lot of dispensary work.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was the fucking person.
[SPEAKER_10]: I did basically everything.
Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got plenty of budtending experience
as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I grew the weed.
[SPEAKER_10]: I bud tended for a long time.
[SPEAKER_10]: I opened and closed the shop.
[SPEAKER_10]: I did the bank deposits.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I've got a lot of dispensary
experience.
[SPEAKER_10]: We started doing this back when we're like
budtending was being invented.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like what that looked like we sort of
created.
[SPEAKER_10]: There was no marijuana enforcement
division tracking system.
[SPEAKER_10]: There was no regulation.
[SPEAKER_10]: There was no proper zoning.
[SPEAKER_10]: There was none of that shit which is why
we don't have a shop now because we kind
[SPEAKER_10]: of made all the rules.
[SPEAKER_10]: They decided let's make rules that pushes
them out is what made all the rules for
[SPEAKER_10]: our community here.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how the rules were made.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a piece of it for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever fucks them.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the new rule.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how they worked on it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to talk a little bit how to
conduct yourself like a proper gentleman
[SPEAKER_10]: or gentle woman in a dispensary since all
my friends work here.
[SPEAKER_09]: The tips are going to be a little bit like
everybody and then kind of pro level.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we have a rec shop and a medical
shop.
[SPEAKER_09]: The expectations are going to be a little
bit different in those two different
[SPEAKER_09]: marketplaces.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's because one's medical, one's rec.
[SPEAKER_09]: One customer type is just anybody walking
in off the street or drove here from a
[SPEAKER_09]: neighboring state to check it out for the
first time.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the other has like joined a state
program and should know considerably more
[SPEAKER_09]: about the product and the selection and
whatnot when they walk in.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like how you said should know.
[SPEAKER_10]: But also the first couple of times may
require much more guidance the first
[SPEAKER_10]: couple of times.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things I really wanted to
stress for this show is questions are
[SPEAKER_09]: totally appropriate.
[SPEAKER_09]: They might not be appropriate in that
moment.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a guy recently that asked me,
is this a good time to ask a lot of
[SPEAKER_09]: questions?
[SPEAKER_09]: I noticed you guys are usually busy.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's slow now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I said, sure dude, it's dead right
now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a fire away.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it turns out this guy had been
shopping with us for like six or seven
[SPEAKER_09]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was enough that I knew his face and
kind of knew what his order was going to
[SPEAKER_09]: be.
[SPEAKER_09]: But he really had no clue what he was
doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Was a total marijuana novice and needed
everything kind of broken down for him.
[SPEAKER_09]: All the lingo, all the different products.
[SPEAKER_09]: He'd just been coming in, buying a joint,
taking it home, unrolling it, and smoking
[SPEAKER_09]: a little bit of it in the tiny cheap ass
glass pipe we sold him his first time in.
[SPEAKER_09]: And since then I've kind of had him up and
showed him the ropes and got him going.
[SPEAKER_09]: But he just waited for the right time to
ask questions.
[SPEAKER_09]: People should be free to ask those
questions.
[SPEAKER_09]: Come in and do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if there's a long ass line and it's
100 degrees outside and everybody in the
[SPEAKER_09]: lobby is impatient, don't smile at me big
and go, it's my first time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell me about everything in depth.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to know everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then listen to the answers to the
questions.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if you ask me for a third time in
under five minutes, it's going to be hard
[SPEAKER_09]: not to be, I don't know, disappointed in
you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, did I just go off on a little rant?
[SPEAKER_09]: We like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: We love it when you ramble.
[SPEAKER_08]: We love it when you ramble.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys were dishing out the dabs.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is partially on you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Be aware is what I took from that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just be aware of if there's a time and
place for everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this the time and place to ask a
million questions or are there a hundred
[SPEAKER_10]: people in line?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, we would love to treat every patient,
every customer, every... So since it's
[SPEAKER_10]: not, this is an odd question, since it's
not medical, what do you call the people?
[SPEAKER_10]: Customer.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're just custies now?
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we would try to treat every customer,
every patient as it's their first time and
[SPEAKER_10]: they're golden.
[SPEAKER_10]: But sometimes we have a line to move and
there are people that are just getting
[SPEAKER_10]: pissed and the dispensaries have to stop
taking orders at a certain time.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if they don't have everybody out of
there, they'll get fined and the last
[SPEAKER_10]: shoppers in the place can't get rung up.
[SPEAKER_10]: So sometimes it is a rush to get through
the crowd because not so much at the
[SPEAKER_10]: medical dispensaries, but the recreational
dispensary that Mike represents,
[SPEAKER_10]: they are busy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes there is a line and they got to
rush through to get everybody out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, we're kind of small.
[SPEAKER_08]: So sometimes like when we get,
I mean, you can't have more than one
[SPEAKER_08]: person to one, but like one group of,
if you're all together, like there's two
[SPEAKER_08]: or three of you to one budtender.
[SPEAKER_08]: So like, I can't have a lot of people in
the budtending room while it's just me.
[SPEAKER_08]: If like someone comes in with their
friend, I can take both of them back and
[SPEAKER_08]: be back there by myself.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if anyone else comes back as a
patient, then another budtender or
[SPEAKER_08]: someone, another employee needs to come
out on the floor.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it does actually, it can get kind of
busy over at Green and Holdy just
[SPEAKER_08]: depending on like what happens,
but that's because we're super tiny.
Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the whole place is super tiny.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's usually two budtenders there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had Joe in there today and I was like,
well, thank God.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause it got kind of like crazy at one
point and I was like, yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to Hunt for covering shifts.
[SPEAKER_08]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you, I don't think you
listen to the show, bro, but either way,
[SPEAKER_10]: Hunt's getting a shout out.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's covering shifts at the Grow.
[SPEAKER_10]: And at the store and it's fucking rad.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good work, brother.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: We appreciate having a boss that's willing
to grab the fucking broom and sweep up
[SPEAKER_10]: when we need that shit done.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's not above any job, which is pretty
cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: Gotta love it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's dope.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, be aware if it's not the right
time, don't go asking a bunch of
[SPEAKER_10]: questions.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sneak a couple of questions in there as
shit's happening.
[SPEAKER_10]: While the budtender is weighing stuff,
throw out some questions.
[SPEAKER_10]: The one golden question that you really
need answered.
[SPEAKER_10]: Try to throw that out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there might be a manager that can help
you if you really have some questions.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's quite often a manager that needs
something to do.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's his job is to field that type
of shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: So find a manager and the budtender may be
happy to point you to one.
[SPEAKER_10]: That may be your new strategy,
bros.
[SPEAKER_10]: Terry can answer that or whoever the fuck
is there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's nobody there named Terry.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're very different as shop layouts.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I might have 20 people in my,
20 customers in my bud room at one time.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm being helped by five or six different
budsetters.
[SPEAKER_09]: All this moving around, it can get like
kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they play loud music in your bud room.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's music going and people going and
people coming in and out shopping,
[SPEAKER_09]: IDs getting checked, people waiting in
line.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then other times it's super slow.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like it just varies.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we made a little, some, just a very
short list of things to talk about here
[SPEAKER_10]: because we wanted to have something to
talk about.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you guys like it when it ramble,
but we want some structure to this
[SPEAKER_10]: madness.
[SPEAKER_10]: The first thing that you should think
about when you're in the dispensary,
[SPEAKER_10]: a lot of you people that are listening,
this may not apply, but a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_10]: need to think about this one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Watch your mouth in the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not saying you can't say the F word.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't, you can't use profanity,
but if you have any intentions of the
[SPEAKER_10]: product that you were buying, leaving your
hands, just keep your mouth shut about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't hint about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't joke about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not going to flip that.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is not for anybody else.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you are not going to ship that
product.
[SPEAKER_10]: If any of those things are going to
happen, if you're even allowed the sale,
[SPEAKER_10]: the moment you walk out of the door,
the budtender and the manager have a
[SPEAKER_10]: little meeting together and they're like,
Hey, fuck this guy.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they put you on the band list.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have it in the computer to where
when we run your name that you're checking
[SPEAKER_10]: in, it pops up and says, do not sell to
this customer.
[SPEAKER_10]: So don't, don't talk about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't it.
[SPEAKER_10]: You might do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That might be your thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to say do that, but I mean
fucking do that.
[SPEAKER_10]: If that's your thing, do your thing
player, pimp it out, but don't tell us
[SPEAKER_10]: about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't want to know about your black
market hustle.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've gone legit for a reason.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have to cut you off.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you tell us that we don't want to have
to cut you off.
[SPEAKER_10]: So do your thing and just keep your mouth
shut.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Legally, we are not allowed to sell you
anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once you say to us that you are going to
take that weed and redistribute it in any
[SPEAKER_08]: form.
[SPEAKER_08]: At that point, we have to refuse the sale
and say, sorry, we can't sell you
[SPEAKER_08]: anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to leave now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it, it's so serious.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't, you can't walk into a bedroom
and say, oh, this, this two ounces of wax
[SPEAKER_08]: that I'm picking up are all going to go to
Florida.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't say like, I'm so done.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a great day.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thinking you were going to buy that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I get the same thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I used to joke that I wanted to make a hat
that says, stop asking me how to take this
[SPEAKER_09]: to Texas.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it's, I mean, sometimes it's innocent.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like you look at, they'll look up and go
like, do you think the drug dogs going to
[SPEAKER_09]: smell the weed candy bar in the cooler?
[SPEAKER_09]: And my response is always just a flat
level look right in the eye and go,
[SPEAKER_09]: yeah, like it's not magic.
[SPEAKER_09]: And to make matters worse, it's been in a
weed store full of other weed getting
[SPEAKER_09]: touched by people that touch weed over and
over and over again.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like just because the chocolate happens to
be in a child proof container doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_09]: it's special.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just stop.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like we know that people are going to do
this from time to time.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't stop you, but if you articulate
that in the bud room, we have to refuse
[SPEAKER_09]: the sale and kick you out.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that sucks.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not fun for anybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't want to kick people out.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't want to get kicked out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just knock it off.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So watch your mouth when you're in there,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_10]: We went off on a tangent, but they like it
when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_10]: Since Lindsay's here, here is something
that we thought we should talk about.
[SPEAKER_10]: When you're in the dispensary,
oftentimes there are beautiful young
[SPEAKER_10]: ladies working at the counter.
[SPEAKER_10]: They will greet you.
[SPEAKER_10]: They will take your ID.
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll check your paperwork.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't fucking flirt with them.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not there for you to flirt with.
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep your dick in your pants at the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_10]: Chill out on that shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're trying to work.
[SPEAKER_10]: They got a job to do.
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't want to fucking hear it.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've been there all day working.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not there for that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just shut up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep it to yourself.
[SPEAKER_10]: Save it for later.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just leave Lindsay alone.
[SPEAKER_10]: Leave all the other hotties that work in
the dispensary alone.
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't want to hear it.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: You wouldn't even believe it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen it once or twice when I was
there shopping.
[SPEAKER_08]: That just happened.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's constant and it's disturbingly
frequent.
[SPEAKER_10]: Lindsay's one of my best friends and I
love it when we hang out at events.
[SPEAKER_10]: People always think we're together because
she's got dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_10]: We look like we could hang out.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't be surprised.
[SPEAKER_10]: If we said we dated, people would be like,
yeah, I saw that coming.
[SPEAKER_10]: We became too good of friends and skipped
that phase.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love it when we hang out at events
because people think we're together and
[SPEAKER_10]: guys don't bother her and girls don't even
come talk to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of times other dudes won't even come
talk to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they think I'm talking to a girl
and they're like, oh, just leave them
[SPEAKER_10]: alone.
[SPEAKER_10]: We just get to hang out and enjoy some
time and some music and wherever we went
[SPEAKER_10]: for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't wait for next secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, secret sesh.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can't wait.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know when, I know when it's going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know when it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_10]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_08]: The date got released on Monday.
[SPEAKER_10]: Did they really release that?
[SPEAKER_08]: The 23rd.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I'm in Vegas that day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you are.
[SPEAKER_10]: I am.
[SPEAKER_08]: God, stop telling people that in the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I said that- God damn it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Man, my bad on the dabs earlier,
guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: My eyes are as red as the red in my
Colorado shirt.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sitting here looking at it like I
could go for one more.
[SPEAKER_10]: Take a dab, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not going to stop you.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you think you could go for one more,
we need you to do that.
[SPEAKER_10]: We need you where you want to be.
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't have a show to host.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll drive.
[SPEAKER_10]: You just ramble in the middle.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm on it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look, she just handed you the hash to take
as big a dab as you want.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that Lemon G?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that is the Cactus Cooler.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: It tastes like Lemon G when I hit it,
but- Yeah, it's the Cactus Cooler.
[SPEAKER_10]: This stuff's delicious.
[SPEAKER_10]: I finally ended up with a cut of that
Cactus Cooler.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: We talked about that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm stoked.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to be fun to play with you
guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cactus Cooler, it tastes, if you've ever
had a Cactus Cooler soda, it tastes just
[SPEAKER_10]: like it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know it sounds like bullshit,
but it does.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it crazy that it smells and tastes like
Fruit Loops to me and it's like flower
[SPEAKER_08]: form?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like opened up the jar of it the other
day at the shop and I was like- Mike,
[SPEAKER_10]: get up on Mike a little bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let him hear you.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's enough.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just kidding.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude is dying for a little dab over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you sure?
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't give him the dab.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't kill him.
[SPEAKER_08]: He took it himself.
[SPEAKER_10]: The next bullet point we've got written
down is, when you're at the dispensary and
[SPEAKER_10]: you're buying either the medical or the
recreational dispensary, don't tell me how
[SPEAKER_10]: high you are.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm at work, fucker.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been here for probably four or six
hours and haven't had a chance to go blaze
[SPEAKER_10]: and you're telling me, I'm so high right
now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a great point.
[SPEAKER_08]: Leave me the fuck alone.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the other thing is like you guys
usually say that after you've done
[SPEAKER_08]: something either really wrong or said
something really wrong or said something
[SPEAKER_08]: really illegal or like- Or minimal,
really embarrassing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, oh man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or just drove here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, and I don't understand.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, like, I just don't know if you're
trying to look cool while you're saying
[SPEAKER_08]: it, but like, I'm not trying to be mean.
[SPEAKER_08]: It really doesn't make you look cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just makes me think that you're an
airhead stoner.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: That I'm so high right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a little old, especially when
we're at work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: We wish we were stoned too, but we're at
work.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like it's a real job.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's something that a lot of people
don't get.
[SPEAKER_09]: The guy that works at the liquor store
isn't drunk.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, why does everyone assume we're baked
out of our mind?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't smoke on the premises.
[SPEAKER_08]: On the premises.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't smoke within like a thousand
feet away from that place.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you smoke cigarettes on the- At the
grow?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, at the grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: On the dispensary premises.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, isn't there like a, you have to be a
certain feet away from- It's just policy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Usually anything that can be construed as
marijuana consumption can get a shop in a
[SPEAKER_09]: lot of trouble.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so there are plenty of shops that
don't even let people consume tobacco on
[SPEAKER_09]: the property.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't like it when people roll into the
dispensary and they're smoking a cigarette
[SPEAKER_08]: because now I have to really sit there and
look and see what you're smoking,
[SPEAKER_08]: realistically.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, I mean, you guys just come in and
say the weirdest stuff and most illegal
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I have to assume you're coming in and
doing it too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just chill.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just chill.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Chill the fuck out, you guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got to remember what we're doing here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, yes, it's a weed store.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, the people in it are also huge
cannabis fans.
[SPEAKER_09]: We really like it too.
[SPEAKER_09]: We love getting dabbed to the point where
we're fucking this high.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we don't roll into this supermarket
and when we go to pay for our shit,
[SPEAKER_09]: like, yo, I'm so high right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of us do.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of us do, but like- Yeah,
but it's the same people doing it at the
[SPEAKER_08]: dispensary.
Knock it off.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's annoying there too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Knock it off.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's annoying there too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I like the, whoever made the liquor
store analogy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was you, Mike.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you don't walk into the liquor store
drinking.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why would you like, you know, it's just
like- A lot of people do.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got to respect there's a business
license at stake at these places.
[SPEAKER_10]: The license is ours.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ridiculously expensive.
[SPEAKER_09]: And shops can lose them for very minor-
Silly.
[SPEAKER_09]: For things that you do.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Seemingly obnoxious things.
[SPEAKER_09]: If customers, for example, check out,
take their product, and then walk into the
[SPEAKER_09]: bathroom with it, we can get fined.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so our security guard is forever on
the lookout for anyone headed towards the
[SPEAKER_09]: bathroom just so we can make sure they
don't happen to have a bad bag,
[SPEAKER_09]: a sealed product bag with them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause it could look like onsite
consumption.
[SPEAKER_09]: And just that somebody walking in there,
setting the bag, the stuff they just
[SPEAKER_09]: bought on the paper towel dispenser,
going to the bathroom, washing their hands
[SPEAKER_09]: and leaving could cost us our license.
[SPEAKER_09]: And like, I don't really want to out the
shops like annual gross or anything,
[SPEAKER_09]: but like we do a good bit of business and
that business employs a good number of
[SPEAKER_09]: people.
[SPEAKER_09]: And all of that's over because some dude
took his shit next to a bag of marijuana
[SPEAKER_09]: he legally purchased.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just to get started a million bucks,
600,000 to a million bucks just to get
[SPEAKER_10]: started with a dispensary.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's all your permits and stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not even a place to have it,
a place you have a grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are so many more things to think
about.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is just permitting, like,
excuse me, permits and being licensed.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a massive, massive industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: We couldn't, it all do what we do.
[SPEAKER_09]: Under the level of scrutiny that we
operate under if we were all baked all
[SPEAKER_09]: day.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that brings me to one of the next
bullet points that we wrote down.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't blame the rules on the bud tenders a
lot.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen people get mad.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've showed up to the spot dispensary
where Mike works.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's try not to say their name too much,
but Lindsay called them out for us.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have no longer affiliated, so I don't
say their name too much.
[SPEAKER_10]: No hatred or anything.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just let that be known.
[SPEAKER_10]: So they have a security guard right as you
walk in security guard right there,
[SPEAKER_10]: boom, waiting for you.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he's like, ID, please.
[SPEAKER_10]: And a lot of people are like, who the fuck
are you?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, actually who the fuck are you?
[SPEAKER_10]: You're coming into our place.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, that's kind of the vibe right
there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't walk into here and question
authority.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like that security guard is there to keep
that place compliant.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if you're not old enough,
you gotta get the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've had customers sit there and talk
shit about him.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, it's nuts.
[SPEAKER_09]: People do the weirdest shit at the lead
store.
[SPEAKER_09]: The weirdest stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: But those security guards are only doing
their job.
[SPEAKER_10]: The rules are, and we have, and people
that hate this security guard,
[SPEAKER_10]: that dude is just doing his job.
[SPEAKER_10]: Making sure that people that aren't under
21 don't get in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if people are under 21 get in
there and buy weed, guess what?
[SPEAKER_10]: Place closes.
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't get mad at Mike or Lindsay when
they won't sell you product illegally.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a business license at stake here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Most of my listeners, we don't even have
to tell them this, but maybe they'll share
[SPEAKER_10]: this.
[SPEAKER_10]: There are cameras everywhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: From at the grow, I can't go anywhere and
not be, I can barely close the bathroom
[SPEAKER_10]: door and then I'm not on camera.
[SPEAKER_10]: As long as I'm in there with the bathroom
door closed and I'm not on camera,
[SPEAKER_10]: as soon as I walk out, back on camera,
time to go, smile, you're on candid camera
[SPEAKER_10]: from every freaking angle.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the cameras are so good that if we
lose a key, you can circle the key on the
[SPEAKER_10]: screen with your finger.
[SPEAKER_10]: You circle the key and then you can track
the key in the video.
[SPEAKER_10]: The video will just follow the key from
camera to camera and show you where it
[SPEAKER_10]: goes until you can find your keys that you
lost earlier today.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how good those cameras are.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so anybody that thinks that they're
like, well, just do this for me.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no just do this for me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Every time something happens, it's on
camera.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's documented in a computer.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no pull and no fast ones.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's no getting away with that shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: And nobody would risk their a hundred
thousand dollar facility or just to sell
[SPEAKER_10]: you an extra illegal gram or three or an
ounce.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not worth it.
[SPEAKER_10]: The other that 30 to $400 they would make
is not worth their business license
[SPEAKER_10]: because they have five other customers in
line that are going to spend that already.
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't need to risk it on you.
[SPEAKER_10]: So don't, don't ask people to break the
rules.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't be mad at Mike and Lindsay and
myself, even that there are rules that
[SPEAKER_10]: have to be enforced, just how that shit
is.
[SPEAKER_10]: We get to play, let us play.
[SPEAKER_10]: We paid to play.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let us do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the stuff people complain about and the
rules they break are so bizarre.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like that security guards there for your
safety too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like we just had a shop in Aurora get
robbed or where the security guard was
[SPEAKER_09]: shot three times and killed.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just going to say that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the one in the Springs that got held
up yesterday.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't see that one yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: As, as a whole, like the, the statistics
on it don't, the dispensaries get robbed a
[SPEAKER_09]: lot less frequently than they should
statistically.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because most people know we have intense
security kit setups on every shop.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's required.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you don't have a security system,
good enough to bust anybody doing
[SPEAKER_09]: something stupid on the property.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't get a license.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't get to be a marijuana business.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just how it is in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not as frequent as it could be.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm especially giving the cash nature only
in most of the business, but it's still an
[SPEAKER_09]: issue.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like the armed security guards there for a
reason.
[SPEAKER_09]: The rules that we operate under are there
for a reason.
[SPEAKER_09]: That reason might be, and often is,
making some whiny son of a bitch up in
[SPEAKER_09]: Denver that's operating from a place of
fear and paranoia and has no idea what
[SPEAKER_09]: they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they created some dumb ass rule we have
to follow.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're all willing to follow right now
just to set a good example for
[SPEAKER_09]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_09]: Under no circumstances are we going to
sell you over the limit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Under no circumstances are we going to
sell you where you can buy pounds.
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of us don't even know anymore because
why would we bother?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just not worth it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't stress enough how regulated the
cannabis industry is.
[SPEAKER_10]: From seed to sale is what they call it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is so regulated.
[SPEAKER_08]: And for all of you who don't live in
Colorado and think that it is just some,
[SPEAKER_08]: and when you come here, you guys think
it's just some, you know, open system,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's not.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are so regulated.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you guys are right.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can't just slip you an extra.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't just bring you up for an extra if,
excuse me, if they look at the books and
[SPEAKER_08]: see that I sold you over what your limit
is, I can get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_08]: The whole shop can get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can get shut down.
[SPEAKER_08]: They can just come in and say,
okay, that's it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut down until further notice,
until we've gone through your books and
[SPEAKER_08]: seen what we, like, you know, we've gone
through everything.
Everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then that's it.
[SPEAKER_08]: No jobs, no nothing.
[SPEAKER_08]: No reason to grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no store.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like it's just, I'd be done.
[SPEAKER_10]: My tremor would be done.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's how many people at Green and
Healthy at the store?
Four.
[SPEAKER_08]: There is four of us.
[SPEAKER_10]: All four of you would be done.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not just the one location that it
gets screwed up at.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's every license tied to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's happened a couple of times in
Colorado where a marijuana business with
[SPEAKER_09]: five or six different licenses,
they had a couple of dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_09]: One or two grows and maybe a product
manufacturing license somewhere doing
[SPEAKER_09]: hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: One specific license, one specific
location, had a couple of violations.
[SPEAKER_09]: Two weeks later, all seven licenses
suspended indefinitely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Seven months later, when they finally get
a hearing, their licenses are revoked.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the whole business is closed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Millions of dollars gone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dozens of people out of work.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you just wandered off the street from
Texas.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why would I sell you over the limit?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it just doesn't make any sense
what you're asking.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's confusing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Marisol will.
[SPEAKER_10]: Allegedly.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_10]: They will not.
[SPEAKER_10]: They probably will.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's where I get to a segue.
[SPEAKER_10]: You kind of just set me up into a good
segue for something that, this is a line
[SPEAKER_10]: that Mike and I used to get to say to
people at our dispensary that we had,
[SPEAKER_10]: that we didn't put this one on the list of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: We didn't go over this, but I already know
what he's going to say.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: This was the greatest thing to say to
people is there are no returns at a
[SPEAKER_10]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you buy a product, we legally cannot
take it back from you.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you leave the store with that product,
it is now yours.
[SPEAKER_10]: Please look at the product that you're
going to buy before you purchase it.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll show it to you.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll fucking take it out of the package.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't touch it until you purchase it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a rule in the store.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't put your hands on it,
but you can get real close and look at it.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can tell what it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: You could smell it.
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't do no bait and switch.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's none of that shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want this grand gram that you see,
Lindsay will put the lid on that gram and
[SPEAKER_10]: you can't carry it to the counter.
[SPEAKER_10]: A badged employee actually has to carry
that product to the cash register and ring
[SPEAKER_10]: it up and until it's packaged and ready to
go, they can't give it to you,
[SPEAKER_10]: but you'll get that gram.
[SPEAKER_10]: There are no returns.
[SPEAKER_10]: Make sure you like that shit before you
leave and then don't go home and complain
[SPEAKER_10]: on Facebook that you bought some shit that
you didn't want.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my advice.
[SPEAKER_10]: No returns at the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_10]: That leads me into this next part.
[SPEAKER_10]: There are no discounts at the dispensary
either.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you know Hunt, good for you.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you know Rasta Jeff, sorry,
we can't give you a discount because Rasta
[SPEAKER_10]: Jeff does not make the prices here at the
store.
[SPEAKER_10]: The store prices are set by the owner of
the store and they're held by the
[SPEAKER_10]: management.
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't fuck with that.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the old line that somebody used to,
everybody used to love to tell Mike and I
[SPEAKER_10]: when we had the dispensary downtown,
but the dispensary in the county will give
[SPEAKER_10]: me ounces for way cheaper than you.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's cheaper over there.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the deal?
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's like, dude, if that's really the
price, why did you come here?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what we would always tell them.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll go over there and get an ounce and
get me one while you're there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll give you money if it's that cheap.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they just look at you like fuck.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause they were lying every time.
[SPEAKER_10]: We knew it.
[SPEAKER_09]: The one I get all the time now is,
well, my cousin has ounces for this.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm like, well, if that's true,
you're here for one of two reasons.
[SPEAKER_09]: A, he got sick of you for some reason and
stopped answering your phone calls.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or B, you got sick of having one weed
option and you came to a store that has
[SPEAKER_09]: 50.
[SPEAKER_09]: You came here for a reason.
[SPEAKER_09]: That reason wasn't, we had ounces for the
same price as your fucking cousin.
[SPEAKER_08]: And thanks for incriminating your cousin,
BT dubs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sloppy calls that dry snitching.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to my man Sloppy up on the
mountain.
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope you listen to the podcast still,
brother.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing but love.
[SPEAKER_10]: We can talk about it now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Congratulations on the little one,
Sloppy.
[SPEAKER_10]: You've made it public.
[SPEAKER_10]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_10]: Much love on the little Sloppy,
little Sloppy Savannah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so excited for Papa Slop.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you guys not hear how tired I am?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I'm just saying, we've been saying
congratulations to a lot of people lately
[SPEAKER_09]: and I'm starting to think people don't
understand how exhausted I am.
[SPEAKER_10]: Slop's a young kid and wants to fuck,
so I mean, he done made him a baby.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how it works.
[SPEAKER_10]: You like to fuck as much as Sloppy does.
[SPEAKER_10]: You make some babies.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm birth control.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what I just wanted into,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, what's next on your list?
[SPEAKER_10]: What's next on my list?
[SPEAKER_10]: No discounts, B.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you can get it, if you're going to tell
me that it's cheaper over at that store,
[SPEAKER_10]: go to that fucking store and get it there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't tell me how cheap it is there.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're cool and deserve it,
if you don't ask for some discounts and
[SPEAKER_10]: there's a discount available, the
Budtender will be kind enough to go,
[SPEAKER_10]: hey, you want a dickhead, today is fucking
titties Tuesday and you get the titties
[SPEAKER_10]: discount or whatever it happens to be and
you'll get some deals.
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't have to beg for anything.
[SPEAKER_10]: They slash we will give all of the
customers the appropriate discounts.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like I should add that there's no
minimum purchase.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like because you made it into the Budroom
doesn't mean you have to buy something and
[SPEAKER_09]: act like I'm robbing you.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or you pay for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is very true.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just say no, thank you and turn around and
leave.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do it at stores all the time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even weed related.
[SPEAKER_09]: I walk in, I realize that I don't need to
spend $85 on a t-shirt and I don't buy it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not rude when I do it and the customer
or the employees there aren't offended
[SPEAKER_09]: when I do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But every now and then I'll have somebody
that comes in is shocked by the price of
[SPEAKER_09]: legal marijuana.
[SPEAKER_09]: I ask them what they want.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're like, well, go ahead and give me a
gram of that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when I ring them up, they act like
I've grabbed them by the balls and I'm
[SPEAKER_09]: squeezing money out of their pocket.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so bizarre.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you do have an experience at a
dispensary,
[SPEAKER_10]: if you have a shitty experience at a
dispensary, whether it's recreational or
[SPEAKER_10]: retail, the first plan of attack is not to
go to weed maps and Facebook and bash the
[SPEAKER_10]: place.
[SPEAKER_10]: You should go back, either call or go back
and see if the problem can't be resolved
[SPEAKER_10]: in an adult manner before you go try to
get crazy on the internet.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone's a keyboard commando and they're
all fired up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Chill the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just call the place.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're all adults.
[SPEAKER_10]: We want you to be happy.
[SPEAKER_10]: We want you to come back.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got a reputation to uphold.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got a relationship with you.
[SPEAKER_10]: We want you coming back.
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't want to just take your money and
forget about you.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you're not happy with it,
don't go bash the internet.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just try to contact the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_10]: Try to go back if you can.
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand that a lot of you have
traveled away if it's a recreational
[SPEAKER_10]: facility, but if it's a medical place,
just come back, talk to us.
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't take your refund.
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't take your shit back, but maybe we
can figure out something to make you
[SPEAKER_10]: happier.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe we can adjust things, but don't go
to the internet and be a dick right away.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a business.
[SPEAKER_10]: We will run a business.
[SPEAKER_10]: Most places run a business.
[SPEAKER_10]: If they're still around at this point in
Colorado, they're probably doing things
[SPEAKER_10]: okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that wraps up most of my,
unless you guys got something you want to
[SPEAKER_10]: add to the weed etiquette part,
and I've got another topic I kind of want
[SPEAKER_10]: to talk about for a couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_10]: It won't take too long.
[SPEAKER_09]: A recent article up in Denver,
some news anchor went online to plead with
[SPEAKER_09]: people to wear pants to the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently he walks by one every day on
his way to work or whatever, and there's
[SPEAKER_09]: always people walking in wearing boxers.
[SPEAKER_09]: I assume he means female people,
but I've had a couple of people show up
[SPEAKER_09]: and get, the last one was also drunk,
but walk up barefoot, like in topless to
[SPEAKER_09]: the door, like just a dude wearing some
shorts, no shoes, no shirt, no nothing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's like, no, you're not getting in
bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they get offended when they can't
get in.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, is there any store in America
where you can just roll up barefoot in
[SPEAKER_09]: topless and shop at?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not like an open air market at a
beach.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Where are shoes and a shirt?
[SPEAKER_09]: Surprisingly, there's a weird lack of
common sense sometimes when it's the weed
[SPEAKER_09]: store.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if it's people getting
overexcited or people assuming that,
[SPEAKER_09]: because we're the only place on the planet
that really has weed stores like this that
[SPEAKER_09]: none of the other stores apply.
[SPEAKER_10]: They accidentally, they blend drug dealer
habit and trap house habit into the store
[SPEAKER_10]: experience because they just, in their
mind, in your mind, going to buy weed was
[SPEAKER_10]: going to some white dude with dreadlocks
his house and sitting on his couch and
[SPEAKER_10]: playing dreadlock, playing fucking video
games for 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_10]: I put the white guy with dreadlocks in
there because it used to be me as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was fucking showing up at my house.
[SPEAKER_10]: You just have to come to my house and I'd
make you fucking play seven or eight
[SPEAKER_10]: rounds of black ops just so that you
didn't look like we were doing business.
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to come and listen to whatever
new CD I bought and hang out.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so you used to get into that mode.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to go hang out with Jeff for 30
minutes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Watch two episodes of How It's Made and
then head home.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're thinking that that's going to
happen and that you're their drug dealer
[SPEAKER_10]: now.
[SPEAKER_10]: As soon as they come into the dispenser,
you've now become me for these guys in
[SPEAKER_10]: their mind.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're their surrogate weed dealer.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a little bit of that, but like,
dude, a lot of people I bought weed from
[SPEAKER_09]: before, like if you showed up half drunk,
barefoot, topless at their house,
[SPEAKER_09]: stumbling across from the street,
they'd have screamed at you for 20 minutes
[SPEAKER_09]: before not selling you weed and sending
you home.
[SPEAKER_09]: It depends on who you are.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you show up barefoot and topless here,
there might be prizes.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is like 340 pounds.
[SPEAKER_10]: You just gave me the greatest look.
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at Lindsay's face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: This podcast has got so much.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wasn't sure if I got props or if she was
questioning my judgment or what was
[SPEAKER_10]: happening there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it was like, don't encourage them,
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I thought I read on her face.
[SPEAKER_10]: Barefoot naked.
[SPEAKER_10]: I might have prizes for it.
[SPEAKER_10]: This dude was a prize.
[SPEAKER_10]: Of this dude, I'm not in.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you've got a beard, this does not apply
to you.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been a couple of little bits since we
released the last episode.
[SPEAKER_10]: And nobody has replied with the Walmart
challenge yet or the mullet challenge.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we might have lost some people by
that point in the show.
[SPEAKER_10]: Most people listen all the way.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I hinted that I wanted to talk about
more stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: Recently, I've seen people discussing this
and I wanted to just state my piece on it.
[SPEAKER_10]: On Facebook, there's a thing going around
about illegal cultivators not wanting
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis to be legalized because it's
putting them out of business.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck all that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Come on, don't be a selfish bitch.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: This should be something for everybody.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you wanting it not legalized.
[SPEAKER_10]: By not wanting cannabis legalized,
and most of my listeners are going to want
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis legalized, but this is,
I'm just kind of going off on my own rasta
[SPEAKER_10]: Jeff rant.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those people that are selling cannabis
illegally and producing and hustling and
[SPEAKER_10]: flipping cannabis illegally that do not
want cannabis legalized, the people you
[SPEAKER_10]: are selling that cannabis to are criminals
and will go to jail if they are caught
[SPEAKER_10]: with the product you're selling them.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you seem to be supporting that.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're putting your family, yourself,
your customers, everyone in danger because
[SPEAKER_10]: you're greedy and you want to have a
hustle.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can kind of be a little bit hypocritical
sounding right now because I grow and
[SPEAKER_10]: produce cannabis, but I'm doing it fully
legal for a fully regulated facility.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got a legal legit job, which is
possible when you legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: I pay taxes.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a time clock.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not looking over my shoulder because I
don't want it legalized so that you can
[SPEAKER_10]: have your own hustle or kind of being
stingy bitches and fucking it up for the
[SPEAKER_10]: rest of the country that wants legalized
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: Help us, support us out.
[SPEAKER_10]: What if you helped us legalize it and got
into the industry and used your hustler
[SPEAKER_10]: skills to good use and actually put some
tax money in and actually got a 401k and
[SPEAKER_10]: actually had some benefits and had
something that you could talk about to
[SPEAKER_10]: your family so you didn't have to hide
that shit?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what you want to do all day and not
have to risk everything you have to do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Being a drug dealer is only one skill.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're a drug dealer.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't put that on a resume anywhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can only do that for so long.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the days of the big trap house
grows and the people throwing out mad
[SPEAKER_10]: pounds and flipping packs, that's going
away in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is going away so fast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pueblo is raining in hard.
[SPEAKER_08]: Other cities are also raining in very
hard.
[SPEAKER_09]: The thing that caught me about all the
recent news is that it's all headed to
[SPEAKER_09]: Florida and Texas and places far from
legalization because here the black market
[SPEAKER_09]: price of the pound doesn't make it worth
the effort.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just not worth the effort and risk
anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's not enough profit margin in
between what it takes to produce it and
[SPEAKER_09]: distribute it and the profit you get back
from doing that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just to pay a trimmer and your
electricity, you're breaking even nowadays
[SPEAKER_10]: at the cost of cannabis around here.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to make a profit on it,
you've got to drive it far, far away.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a lot of lights.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a lot of lights and I run two of
them.
[SPEAKER_09]: If that's scary because you're currently
involved in the illegal side of things and
[SPEAKER_09]: you don't think there's going to be a
place for you in legalization,
[SPEAKER_09]: wise up, get involved with the
legalization effort in your area and make
[SPEAKER_09]: sure that those efforts carve out a place
for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think one of the ways Colorado really
fucked up is we didn't make, I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_09]: get my life in order badge for employees.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have previous felonies and stuff
like that, there's no reason you can't be
[SPEAKER_09]: a trimmer somewhere.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no reason you can't be working an
outdoor job somewhere.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like a trustee, like a trustee MED badge?
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, something like a support and
a half badge or something.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what they would call it.
[SPEAKER_09]: White belt.
[SPEAKER_09]: I read articles all the time.
[SPEAKER_09]: People that have been involved in the
black market for cannabis for years around
[SPEAKER_09]: the country, picked up a couple of charges
along the way.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because of that, they hop in the car,
they kind of abandon what little they had
[SPEAKER_09]: built up for a life wherever they were,
come here, hoping to get into the industry
[SPEAKER_09]: and realize that we shut the door on all
those people right at the beginning of
[SPEAKER_09]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right off the bat, we said no felonies in
five years no drug felonies in 10,
[SPEAKER_09]: end of story.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that locked out a huge portion of
people that have been involved in the
[SPEAKER_09]: black market.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think a lot of those people that are
trying to get their shit together should
[SPEAKER_09]: have a way to work in the legal industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's something other than the local head
shop.
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you seen what happens when one of
those persons that was banned for like 10
[SPEAKER_10]: years, when their day comes up and they're
allowed to get their badge and you see
[SPEAKER_10]: them fucking jump full force into the
industry?
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you seen that?
[SPEAKER_10]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: I probably pay more attention because I'm
more into the industry side of things in
[SPEAKER_10]: the scene.
[SPEAKER_10]: I pay attention to the breeders and the
people who are into that part,
[SPEAKER_10]: but I've seen a couple, I won't say their
names because I don't know if that's
[SPEAKER_10]: polite to call people out who just got off
a 10 year thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: But a lot of people have had to wait and
you can see them.
[SPEAKER_10]: They were like at the fucking starting
line and someone pulled that trigger,
[SPEAKER_10]: bang, you can go.
[SPEAKER_10]: And a couple of these people just lept.
[SPEAKER_10]: I see one seed company.
[SPEAKER_10]: Seeds packaged, like seeds packaged and
everything was ready to go.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they were just ready to do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like they were already behind the scenes
with some dispensary telling somebody what
[SPEAKER_10]: to do, guiding them.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then all they had to do was say,
this guy's here, we've got his brand,
[SPEAKER_10]: this is happening.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they just went fucking ape shit when
that happened.
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe Colorado should make like a
cannabis council that you can appeal.
[SPEAKER_09]: I honestly have no idea what we're going
to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: The rules are changing in really weird
ways right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because in a very real way, we're
inventing this shit as we go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no...
[SPEAKER_09]: Like in the last month, we banned a whole
bunch of edibles.
[SPEAKER_09]: They can't be certain shapes now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we let tourists buy four times what
they were currently allowed to buy.
[SPEAKER_09]: And those two changes are in direct
opposition of each other, but are
[SPEAKER_09]: happening at the same time.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very, very strange.
[SPEAKER_09]: The first couple of shops to really get
busted for violations are all going
[SPEAKER_09]: through their hearings.
[SPEAKER_09]: That process is being invented right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is going to keep going on for at
least five years.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a very fun time to live right here in
Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_09]: We just founded a marijuana research
institute here.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: $1.2 million in marijuana taxes going to
our local university.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like 900 from the state, 250 from our
local county.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to Colorado State University
here in Pueblo, right?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: CSUP is it's known locally.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to be doing medical research
and social research.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll finally start getting some hard
data as to what happens when you legalize
[SPEAKER_09]: marijuana for all adults in the community.
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots of cool research taking place down
here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know where that came from,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like it when you ramble.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: We went from talking about illegal growers
to the university testing and doing
[SPEAKER_10]: studies.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cactus Cooler by whoever lives about that
from... I don't know which company made
[SPEAKER_09]: that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Terbex.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's from us.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I thought, but I didn't want
to say it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That cactus cooler cut is kind of
exclusive.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was given a cut of that cactus cooler
and I was told, don't let that out because
[SPEAKER_10]: this is the only place that has it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if it's ever seen out on the streets,
we know you let it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I've got it in my personal grow.
[SPEAKER_10]: It will never go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: It will get pollinated with shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Trust me on that.
[SPEAKER_09]: How long ago did I take that dad,
people?
[SPEAKER_09]: I can still taste it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like to take a lot of credit for
that grow, but honestly you could grow
[SPEAKER_10]: that string with dog poop and it'll come
out tasting delicious.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's real strong.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's super flavorful, super terby.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to the Cactus Cooler Strain.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure where that one came from.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wish I knew.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have an idea, but I don't want to be
wrong.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you know, email the show at... It's
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_10]: We know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hunt knows who that came from.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: It gave me the layups, so I threw it to
you.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it was grown by myself at Green and
Healthy, trimmed by our buddy,
[SPEAKER_10]: John Randalls Jr. Shout out Randalls.
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope you're listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, I know you're listening.
[SPEAKER_10]: Happy Monday, brother.
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope you're back with me trimming.
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's Monday, you're probably back with
me.
[SPEAKER_10]: If not, you will be Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was trimmed by Randalls, and then it was
extracted by our friends at TerpEx.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure which one of the Terpy boys
ran it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Either Shane, probably Shane, maybe Logan.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a really nice job.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they do pretty good work over there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that, Shane.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not just the boys at Terp, but it was
grown well, it was trimmed well,
[SPEAKER_09]: and it was extracted well.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it made it to the end of the dab rig
well.
[SPEAKER_10]: Getting the system figured out over there
at Green and Healthy Wellness.
[SPEAKER_10]: They have a nice grow setup, and it took
me, I think this is like started pulling
[SPEAKER_10]: like the third harvest out of there.
[SPEAKER_10]: The first harvest, I didn't have full
control of the second harvest.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't cut the clones, so they were a
little overgrown by the time I got to it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now we're in clones that I cut myself,
and we're about to harvest all of that
[SPEAKER_10]: stuff pretty soon here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Johnny will be there trimming it down
Monday.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm starting to get it figured out.
[SPEAKER_10]: I really like it.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've switched nutrients.
[SPEAKER_10]: We were using, it was proprietary.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wasn't allowed to say before,
but since we switched, we were using a
[SPEAKER_10]: brand called MB Ferts, which they send us
just powders, and then we would make the
[SPEAKER_10]: nutrients with the water.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'd reconstitute, what's that again?
[SPEAKER_10]: Concentrate.
[SPEAKER_10]: They'd send us concentrate, and then we'd
fucking dilute it, I guess is what we were
[SPEAKER_10]: doing, with hot water.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now we're using VegBloom, the entire
VegBloom line with a couple of other
[SPEAKER_10]: things mixed in, and I can see a huge
difference from the VegBloom line.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those plants are beasting out.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're like a week ahead of the other
plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: They look way fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to ask you that, but I didn't
know if you wanted to talk about that on
[SPEAKER_08]: the podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of go by what Hunt says,
what I can share and what I can't share.
[SPEAKER_10]: Since VegBloom helped us out quite a bit,
I'm all about giving VegBloom a shout out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Plus, I see huge results.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can already see there are three
different sections of plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're like week four, and then about week
six, and then there's another one that's
[SPEAKER_10]: fresh.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can see looking at the VegBloom versus
the MB Ferts, the MB Ferts plants are
[SPEAKER_10]: almost ready to get cut.
[SPEAKER_10]: The VegBloom plants are in week four,
and the buds are already as big as the
[SPEAKER_10]: final product on the MB Ferts table.
[SPEAKER_10]: So VegBloom is killing it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely crushing it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's easy to mix.
[SPEAKER_10]: They send you just bags of powder,
basically.
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like you just got a bunch of
cocaine delivered.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you weigh it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It goes by weight per gallon.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I weigh out approximately,
I think it's about 700 grams of each base.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got two different bases, a hard water
and a soft water, because our water is a
[SPEAKER_10]: certain condition.
[SPEAKER_10]: We mix them for the ideal results.
[SPEAKER_10]: Weigh out certain amounts on a scale.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then just drop it in the water and
give it a good stir.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it dissolves really quickly.
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't chunk up my filters too badly.
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't clog up my sprinkler system.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, it seems to be working for what
I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like it.
Nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess they just got a huge free
commercial from me, didn't they?
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to our friends at VegBloom.
[SPEAKER_09]: I liked the product.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would use it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd recommend it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's simple to use.
[SPEAKER_10]: There are four products.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a base.
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, they have a foliar product that
I fucking hugely recommend.
[SPEAKER_10]: The Push, I think it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: They got a base.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've got Shine.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've got Life and they've got Push.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all you need.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those things will make your plant super
happy.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's silly proof.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can overdo it, but it's silly proof
other than that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to pull our best harvest ever
here pretty soon at Green and Healthy.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm super stoked.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I bet you are because you get to sell it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I am because I get to consume some of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, you do, buddy.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was about to say smoke, but that really
doesn't paint the full picture,
[SPEAKER_09]: does it?
[SPEAKER_09]: You get to dab it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You get to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_10]: You get to smell it.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was an awkward jiggle there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Lindsay needs a dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just reached for it as you said that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Lindsay came over and rolled up a big old
fat blunt and smoked that blunt.
[SPEAKER_10]: To her face by herself.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is not even fair.
[SPEAKER_08]: I offered it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, I know we jokingly told Mike
that I faced a blunt in front of you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, but we're not going to let
people think that I was that rude that I
[SPEAKER_08]: just came over here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not into your flavored blunt wraps,
dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: No offense to you.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't even think about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I forgot you didn't like them the last
time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would have brought different ones.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't like to smoke a blunt period.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I knew you weren't going to smoke
one anyways.
[SPEAKER_10]: You wrap incense around it and I'm not
into it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what it tastes like to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: It tastes like strawberry incense.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't deal with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had this epiphany the other day that,
because I don't smoke cigarettes at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never smoked cigarettes in my life,
but I had this epiphany the other day that
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually addicted to nicotine because
I smoke blunts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, since I've been in Colorado,
I smoke a lot less blunts.
[SPEAKER_08]: I smoke a lot more hash now that I'm out
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I have access to great hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to dab poop soup in Florida.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to poop soup in Florida.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know who you are.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that I'm here, I smoke a lot more
hash, but I realized the other day that I
[SPEAKER_08]: might actually need to cut blunts out
completely, which might really hurt me.
[SPEAKER_10]: You've been coughing quite a bit when you
smoke a blunt.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been insane.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just like, maybe I might.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to actually stop smoking blunts
for a while.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the dabs.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're just more economical.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's more, just less puffs on my lungs.
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel like as a human, you probably get,
it looks like a set of tires.
[SPEAKER_10]: You get so many miles on your lungs,
probably get so many ins and outs.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just talking to you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been staring right at her,
having a conversation with her for a
[SPEAKER_10]: minute.
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought I'd share with you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree with all of this.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been doing a lot of bonkers lately.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been thinking about this though,
because it is a little more expensive that
[SPEAKER_09]: way.
[SPEAKER_09]: It definitely eats up a lot more time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Imagine I consume a lot of hash and
imagine how much hash, how much flour I
[SPEAKER_10]: would have to consume to reach that level
that I get with smoking.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can honestly smoke a half a gram to a
gram of hash just in one sitting while
[SPEAKER_10]: we're just chilling out.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a bunch of conversations about
potency taking place around the country
[SPEAKER_09]: right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's part of it that's missing is the
stuff that's 75, 85% of the THC that we
[SPEAKER_09]: have available to us here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not smoking a two gram blunt of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now that I say that out loud, it sounds
kind of fun, but we're taking a tiny
[SPEAKER_09]: little dab.
[SPEAKER_10]: 0.2 of a gram, about the average size of a
dab around here.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so much smaller, so much quicker.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to take one.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say, we all have been
taking dabs on this show.
[SPEAKER_10]: The show just went super silent.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it's time to start wrapping up the
show.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys maybe can just wrap it up real
quick and then I'll take a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys got any final words?
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for listening everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: This show is kind of bizarre.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you come into dispensaries,
just know what you're allowed to have,
[SPEAKER_08]: know what you're allowed to get,
whether it's medical or recreational.
[SPEAKER_08]: Know your limits, know what you're allowed
to do as a patient and as a member on the
[SPEAKER_08]: medical side.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't come in and ask stupid questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't say illegal things you're going to
do.
[SPEAKER_08]: The whole spiel from this time,
but just really be conscious of yourself
[SPEAKER_08]: and the way you're portraying yourself and
yeah, all of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just be more conscious of yourselves in
the dispensaries, guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: That dab just hit you, didn't it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because I was just like,
I could make this even longer.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, I just need to stop.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just impressed.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got a coherent wrap up again.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like a Jerry Springer's final thoughts is
awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh gosh, I can't believe I've been with
her.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, guys, it's that time.
[SPEAKER_10]: The podcast is wrapping up.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it'd be awesome if you go to iTunes,
go to the iTunes store, search for the
[SPEAKER_10]: Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: Find the review section, type in a
comment.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me know what you think about the
podcast and guess what?
[SPEAKER_10]: I will read your comments on a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_10]: There are probably a couple of hanging out
there that I need to read soon.
[SPEAKER_10]: I will get to those.
[SPEAKER_10]: I promise you.
[SPEAKER_10]: When you're typing in a comment,
click on some stars.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me know what you think.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can get one to five stars.
[SPEAKER_10]: Be honest, click on as many as you think I
deserve.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to pander for five,
but you know, that's always what we want.
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep us up to a solid five-star rating.
[SPEAKER_10]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: What else can you do if you want to
sponsor the show or if you've got a
[SPEAKER_10]: product you'd like to send me to review?
[SPEAKER_10]: If you send us a product, I will get the
product in the mail.
[SPEAKER_10]: We will unbox it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll turn on the microphones.
[SPEAKER_10]: We won't do the whole podcast spiel,
but I'll turn on the microphones.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll sit at the table.
[SPEAKER_10]: Whoever's here with me, oftentimes it's
Mike, will unwrap a product.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll talk about it as we unwrap it.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll talk about how well it was packaged,
what the packaging looks like,
[SPEAKER_10]: how appealing the packaging is.
[SPEAKER_10]: We will take the product out of the
package.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll read the instructions so we can
figure out how to use the thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll get it charged up if we need to.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll press pause.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll go smoke on our own.
[SPEAKER_10]: Once the thing's charged up, we'll come
back.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll use the device, whatever kind of toy
you send us, whatever you'd like reviewed.
[SPEAKER_10]: Put something to smoke.
[SPEAKER_09]: The furniture table was a five-star review
all the way around.
[SPEAKER_10]: That thing's amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you've got a product, we will do your
product justice.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll check it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a smart dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know how to use products.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know how to set the settings to where
they need to be for my comfort level.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll get it figured out and we'll use it.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you need it back, let me know.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll ship the damn thing back to you.
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's a product that can be shipped
back, we'll take care of you.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you've got a product you'd like us to
review, it's growfromyourheartathotmail
[SPEAKER_10]: .com.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'd love to check out your toys,
your inventions, whatever you need put out
[SPEAKER_10]: there on the market.
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of people will hear about your
product.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mike and I, maybe Lindsay, whoever else is
hanging out, we'll check it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_10]: We do hit a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even like to talk about how many
people we reach when I have guests here
[SPEAKER_10]: because it freaks you guys out sometimes.
[SPEAKER_10]: You go silent and get all pale.
[SPEAKER_09]: This week in particular, I got some
feedback from a listener that mentioned
[SPEAKER_09]: that last week was as high as they'd ever
heard me.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, we topped it up,
Seb.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice to say.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to Seb.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for listening, Ross, to Seb.
[SPEAKER_10]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to Fred Garvin.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to everybody that listens to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really rad.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like all the interaction, all the
support.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been getting tons more emails and
messages.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think a lot of it is because we are
now on Tok Radio.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think people are tuning into Tok
Radio and discovering the podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm finding totally new people in my inbox
that I've never listened to.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just discovered there's a whole other
fucking inbox on my Facebook account.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got three inboxes.
[SPEAKER_10]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's another one too, like the
filtered one or something that I've never
[SPEAKER_10]: seen.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even know how it popped up.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't find it again.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I feel like I need to go on my computer
and open up Facebook.
[SPEAKER_10]: I took a screenshot to be like,
where did this come from?
[SPEAKER_10]: So that I could try to find it when I had
more time to surf.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, so if you have sent me a
Facebook message at my personal account,
[SPEAKER_10]: I apologize that I haven't gotten back to
you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't suck that bad at life.
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody bitched at me for not getting
back to them right away.
[SPEAKER_10]: I get no shit 25 to 50, maybe a hundred
Facebook messages and emails a day.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's hard to get to all of them.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there'll be a random day of the week
when I have maybe 10 or 20 minutes to
[SPEAKER_10]: chill out.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm eating lunch, eating a sandwich,
and I'll reply to six emails right then.
[SPEAKER_10]: Boom, boom, boom, boom, as quickly as I
can.
[SPEAKER_10]: And those are the six that I got.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I'll get the next six next time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause I mean, I had a lot of shit going
on.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes it's hard.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my rant on that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, send me an email,
growfromyourheart.com.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll review your products.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's where I was with all that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even have notes in front of me and
I had a little land back on the map.
[SPEAKER_10]: What else do we got?
[SPEAKER_10]: Any announcements or anything you guys
elevate?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what's important.
[SPEAKER_10]: Elevate.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you need glass, if you need smoking
accessories, if you want to see cool
[SPEAKER_10]: glass, you don't have to buy shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're a glass gallery.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can go take a look.
[SPEAKER_10]: They will not be mad at you for looking
and not buying.
[SPEAKER_10]: And go see Inky the dog.
[SPEAKER_10]: Inky's a sweet puppy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go give him a scratch on the forehead.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now he's probably afraid of you.
[SPEAKER_10]: He'll run from you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so tall.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's scared shitless of me.
[SPEAKER_10]: But to go in there and see Inky,
go see all the lovely ladies, go tell them
[SPEAKER_10]: what's up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Elevate glass, 517 South Tejon.
[SPEAKER_10]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're on Tejon and you want to park
and it's all crowded on Tejon and you
[SPEAKER_10]: don't have money for the meter,
fuck it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Turn left or right on Moreno.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's either Monterey or Moreno.
[SPEAKER_10]: It starts with an M right there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Free parking.
[SPEAKER_10]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't pay for parking.
[SPEAKER_10]: Why would you do that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Just go park for free.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like there's that bar across the street.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's got a live band.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's always all crowded.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's hard to park right there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't hit the meters.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just turn left or turn right after you
pass the place.
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll be cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all legit, sunshiny out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go take a little walk.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not trying to tell you what to do,
but hey.
[SPEAKER_08]: Save some money.
[SPEAKER_10]: What would Joey Diaz say?
[SPEAKER_10]: Take a risk.
[SPEAKER_10]: Columbus did.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys, that's all the podcast we've got
for you this week.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to thank my friends for coming and
hanging out with me for a couple hours.
[SPEAKER_10]: I felt a little bit shitty the past couple
of days and some good vibes with some good
[SPEAKER_10]: friends will definitely cheer you up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Make you forget that you didn't feel good.
[SPEAKER_10]: So thanks for coming guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Take some vitamins.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't get sick.
[SPEAKER_10]: Always good advice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Might have to chug that orange juice in my
fridge now Jeff.
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_10]: To everybody out there, take some
vitamins.
[SPEAKER_10]: Take good care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fucking hydrate this summer you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're out at a festival raging,
beer is not hydration.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Pepper is not hydration.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mike, I hate to break it to you dude.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mountain Dew will not hydrate you.
[SPEAKER_10]: That will keep you diabetes and make you
sweaty.
[SPEAKER_09]: Drink water.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's good for you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hydrate yourself.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hydrate your plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: Take good care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're out there in the sunshine.
[SPEAKER_10]: Love yourself.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been special hot lately.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you all are staying cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially outdoor growers.
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to all the outdoor farmers that
are out there getting burnt as shit.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're out working outdoors right now
man, God bless you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm spoiled.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm in a big indoor facility.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's 74 degrees all the time.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's super hot when I go to lunch.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty hot between the facility and
when the air conditioner starts kicking in
[SPEAKER_10]: my car.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty much where I am.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mike's got pretty much the same thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like 83 for a minute in the bud
room the other day.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like 105 outside.
[SPEAKER_09]: It took a minute to get the AC powered up
enough to cool it down.
[SPEAKER_09]: Holy hell.
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't had to use the go outside and
really bake yourself to make it tolerable
[SPEAKER_09]: inside for the next half hour trick in a
while.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to break that one out again this
week.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's serious.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right guys, we just got real deep and
serious.
[SPEAKER_09]: I almost feel like we should do something
fun right now like a sticker pack thing
[SPEAKER_09]: that's just really easy to do for the like
the two people that are still listening.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got some stickers to donate?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but like $4 so that y'all can pick
some up.
[SPEAKER_10]: What kind of prize do you want to offer on
this episode?
[SPEAKER_08]: I totally have mad stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I've got sticker packs.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have plenty of stuff I can throw into
this too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I do have a stack of stickers I
can throw into this.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, let's make some rules.
[SPEAKER_10]: What do people have to do, bro?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we've gone an hour and five
minutes and if they're still listening,
[SPEAKER_10]: they're dedicated listeners.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tweet all three of us.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tweet all three of us.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_10]: What else?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_10]: What do they have to tweet us?
[SPEAKER_10]: They like it when we run.
[SPEAKER_10]: They can make one tweet.
[SPEAKER_10]: One tweet.
[SPEAKER_10]: Tag us all three.
[SPEAKER_10]: The traveling stoner.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, the travel stoner.
[SPEAKER_08]: The travel stoner.
[SPEAKER_10]: The travel stoner.
[SPEAKER_10]: We didn't even let you guys do your plugs.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_10]: The travel stoner.
[SPEAKER_10]: NemoPunk15 and at GFYH podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't tag my personal one.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got to follow the instructions at GFYH
podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm writing that down.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to remember that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to be behind.
[SPEAKER_10]: Forget.

where there's just like one that will be
[SPEAKER_08]: listening.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a guess.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: This kind of went everywhere.

[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to have a lot of fun with it.

hitter in the fridge for afterwards so we
