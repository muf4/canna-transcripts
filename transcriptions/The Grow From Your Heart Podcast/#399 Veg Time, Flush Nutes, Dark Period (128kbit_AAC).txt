[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 399 of the Grow From
Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by Oregon
Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds in your garden,
I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can find them at www

[SPEAKER_00]: It has become a tradition that we start
the podcast off by talking about what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of banana
wafer kush from Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label says that this concentrate
contains 74.9% THC with a total of 89.6%
[SPEAKER_00]: total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy the stony buzz from the
banana wafer kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a great flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a great texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a great consistency, and I really
like the way it makes me feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at
Apothecary Farms for the delicious banana
[SPEAKER_00]: wafer kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, in this episode,
I'm going to read a few more listener
[SPEAKER_00]: emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not waste a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into this first email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This first message goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that puts a smile on my face every
time I hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like my grow lessons were
perfectly timed up with a lot of people's
[SPEAKER_00]: very first grow, and that puts a smile on
my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I was able to help so many people
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I made your grow experience less
stressful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I made it more fun and overall more
enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, man, I'm glad I was able to help you
out with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the message goes on to say I am using
cocoa for my medium along with Success
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Success has recommended that I add their
product called sugar all the way through
[SPEAKER_00]: the final flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is, is it necessary to do so
during the final flush because I've heard
[SPEAKER_00]: conflicting views on it from those I get
information from locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: One person even stated that cocoa needs
something in the water for the plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: grab a hold of in order to drink properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you again for your time,
and I'll for sure give my mom a hug for
[SPEAKER_00]: you since she is in town on her vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, bro, I hope you and your mom had a
great time during her vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about Success
Nutrients and flushing with cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I generally don't find it necessary
to use any nutrients or products during
[SPEAKER_00]: the flush phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our goal is to clean out the medium so the
plants will stop eating so that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: clean them up so that when we dry and cure
them, the buds taste delicious and they
[SPEAKER_00]: burn nice and smoothly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there has been a lot of controversy
or a lot of conversation around the
[SPEAKER_00]: subject of flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it necessary?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it do anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we wasting our time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Could we be improving our plants a little
by feeding longer?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm learning a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is still a lot of debate going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I have made a decision on how I feel,
I will share more information with you on
[SPEAKER_00]: the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this podcast, let's talk about the
standard two-week flush phase that most
[SPEAKER_00]: growers are familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said a moment ago, I generally
don't find it necessary to add any
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients during the flush phase unless
you've had problems during the grow or
[SPEAKER_00]: unless you know you were feeding
excessively.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really push my plants to the limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes during the flush phase,
I'll use an enzyme just to help clean up
[SPEAKER_00]: that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the time, I'm just adding
water, just clean water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I pH, sometimes I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will be a part of the conversation I
have in the future when I talk about my
[SPEAKER_00]: new ideas about flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm still learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to teach anything until I
have a solid grasp on my new learnings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're flushing, we're trying to
clean out the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want the plants to eat anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is our main goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to starve them just before
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the product that was recommended is
called sugar, which in my mind
[SPEAKER_00]: automatically led me to believe that this
was some sort of a sweetener product,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I could understand why a company
would recommend a sweetener product toward
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did some research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to the Success Nutrients website
and I did research on their product called
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sugar is actually not sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sugar is actually high in sulfur and
magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you understand plant biology,
you understand why these elements are good
[SPEAKER_00]: for the plants and why they may be
recommended late in flower, but they are
[SPEAKER_00]: not necessary at this stage of the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't find it necessary to feed high
amounts of sulfur and magnesium this late
[SPEAKER_00]: in flower, but it won't be detrimental.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't cause a problem if you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you're really overdosing these
products, I don't think you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: notice it in the flavor of the final
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may increase trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may increase resin production.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may increase that final bulk,
but also it may not do much at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be just simply a sales tactic
for a nutrient company to sell you a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more of a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not look at the price of this
product by the description.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the look of the website, I assume this
is a pretty pricey product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it necessary?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it is not necessary to add anything to
your flush when you were flushing your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants for the last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 days, two weeks, however you decide to
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not necessary to add any product to
the flush in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can flush with just plain water and it
is optional if you even pH that water
[SPEAKER_00]: during your flush phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you've already purchased this
product called Sugar and you've got more
[SPEAKER_00]: than one plant and you're not running a
hydro system, if you were able to feed
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants different nutrient regimens,
here is a suggestion to have a little fun
[SPEAKER_00]: with this product and this product line.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would recommend is select one plant
or maybe select half of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Choose however many you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to do this experiment to where it
works best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But select at least one plant and feed it
the recommended amount of this product all
[SPEAKER_00]: the way through the flush phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write it on that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am feeding this plant sugar all the way
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then take another plant and don't feed it
sugar through the flush phase and mark it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one did not get fed sugar through the
flush phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure they're clearly marked and don't
fuck it up during the last two weeks of
[SPEAKER_00]: bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't feed one the wrong mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feed the one sugar for the last two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't feed the one sugar for the last two
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that tag stays with them so you
know which is which.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make that tag stay with them all the way
up until the moment you smoke them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to cut them down, dry them,
cure them, trim them out the way you
[SPEAKER_00]: normally do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat them just like you normally would.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of them need to be treated exactly
the same if you want this experiment to be
[SPEAKER_00]: valid at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't feed the product to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feed the product to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest them the way you normally do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Process them the way you normally do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then consume them the way you normally do
and take note.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you notice any difference?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things you may want to compare are
harvest weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the one you fed the sugar,
is it a little heavier toward the end?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you've been giving it more
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it packed on a little bit more
weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're paying for something in that
bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say that there is sulfur and
magnesium in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that sulfur and magnesium better be
converting to something tangible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something quantifiable on that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something you should be able to see or
measure in some sort of way because that
[SPEAKER_00]: product is costing you money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it doing something in the end?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we want to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have more harvest weight or do you
have more trichome density?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something we could all desire is
more trichome density.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you get frostier buds by using the
product for the last two weeks of flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe something else to pay attention to
is how does it look visually?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did your plants burn?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they start to look like shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they look really healthy?
[SPEAKER_00]: All the way through?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they show you any visible differences?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that you can pay
attention to as a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something you can learn from.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next test we get to do is the best
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the smoke test.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have properly dried and cured and
processed your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You handled both batches exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's roll one up or let's pack up a
bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, please don't put this sample batch
in a blunt wrap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't get a scientific result from
smoking it out of a toilet paper tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's use something glass or a thin paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be scientific about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's roll one up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's pack up a bowl and see how it burns.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one that you fed for the extra two
weeks, does it burn funky?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it taste different?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the ash chunky?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it gross to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it burn your throat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it burn your lips?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the high give you a headache?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it different in any way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that product that you flushed for two
weeks, is it nice and smooth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it make you choke?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it make you cough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the high different than the other one
in any way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Compare the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe smoke one, the first smoke today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then your first smoke tomorrow,
try one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just alternate for a couple of
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe stick with one for a whole day,
stick with another one for a whole day so
[SPEAKER_00]: you can actually get a real result from
your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only way you can tell if they
are just trying to sell you something so
[SPEAKER_00]: that you spend more money or if it is
actually going to make a difference in
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow, in your environment,
in your situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the short answer is no, it is not
necessary to apply that product late in
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fun answer is since you've already
got it, let's apply it to some plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: not others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do a little bit of an experiment and
let's find out for ourselves what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting out of this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, that's really the only fair
way to judge a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't judge it just by reading a
label.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't judge it by what you hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the best way to make a real
decision, a real judgment on any product
[SPEAKER_00]: is to experiment with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a controlled experiment and find out
for yourself what you think about that
[SPEAKER_00]: product in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things that work for your bros aren't
going to work for you and some things that
[SPEAKER_00]: work for you aren't going to work for your
bros.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very small differences in a grow
environment will make large differences in
[SPEAKER_00]: the final outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every little spoke will make a difference
in the way that wheel rolls in the final
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the only way you can give a fair
assessment, a fair judgment is to run the
[SPEAKER_00]: trial on your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: As for the person who said that cocoa
needs something in the water for the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to grab a hold of the water to drink
properly, I would like to know more
[SPEAKER_00]: information about what they are saying
there because when there are roots exposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to water and the plant is thirsty,
it will drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have flushed countless plants in cocoa
in large facilities without anything in
[SPEAKER_00]: the water and they flushed just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got great lab results.
[SPEAKER_00]: The product tastes great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got huge harvest weights and
everybody is satisfied with the final
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, there was just water in that
final flush for 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to wrap that one up, I encourage you to
run the experiment and when you do,
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to the report from the
results of that experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move right into the next
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's a little shorter and it goes
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: How formal of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great greeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, first and foremost, dude,
we went from sir to dude really quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just got comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for the knowledge you
shared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, you are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the hilarious email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm having fun with this one already.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on to say, I can't begin to tell
you the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before I started listening and after
that means a lot that you're learning
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it worth my time and energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the question is, I also wanted to ask
you a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you put your plants into a dark period
before harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, how long?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this question is asking if I give my
plants a dark period before harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is not uncommon for a lot of growers to
leave their plants in the dark for 24 or
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe 48, or I've even heard 72 hours in
the dark before harvesting their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a small personal grow environment,
yes, I do practice the dark cycle before
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has several benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, it is not feasible in many
commercial environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a lot of commercial environments,
I've got a very large room with multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: lights in there, sometimes 100 lights in
one room, sometimes 200 lights in one
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one building we work in that has
500 lights in one room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of having separate sections,
we just load tables with plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: one table every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets cycled out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is not the opportunity to change
the lights in that room because we've got
[SPEAKER_00]: more plants in there that rely on the
schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't manipulate the light cycle in
some of the larger facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, in a small personal grow,
yes, I do implement the dark cycle before
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has many benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, it's great for your electrical
bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're saving electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not running the gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 12 hours at least of electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not paying for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also 12 hours on your bulb that
your bulb is going to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also 12 hours on your ballast that
your ballast will live.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possibly also 12 more hours on a
couple of blowers and air conditioners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know that just sounds like 12 hours
of electricity, but over a year or two,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in a couple of rooms with multiple
lights, that 12 hours over two or three
[SPEAKER_00]: days will add up.
[SPEAKER_00]: In today's cannabis market, black market,
or legal, prices are dropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every dollar will count at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our first advantage is we are saving
electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: While they are in the dark, the plants are
just swelling up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are just growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow in the dark and they absorb
light energy during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They suck in all that light during the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they go to sleep, that's when
they grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just like a little kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow in their sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to give them a nice long
nap so that they can bulk out and they can
[SPEAKER_00]: grow a little bit in their sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the trichomes kind of seem to mature
a little bit in that dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think they'll ripen up a little bit
more if we leave them in that dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also feel like they get a little more
dense in that final dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I should add that sometimes that is
strain specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: More tropical, skinny leaf, sativa
cultivars may not enjoy that dark period
[SPEAKER_00]: as much as your chunky, thick,
indica dominant, white leaf type
[SPEAKER_00]: varietals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do choose to stick some plants
in the dark for a 24, 36, 48, 72 hour
[SPEAKER_00]: period, I suggest you check on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid just to open the door long
enough to inspect your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a scope, go check out the
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to give them a little
squeeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how they feel on density.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go touching them all over because
that's just going to ruin the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to get the trichomes nice and
mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go rupture the trichomes with your
fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go steal all the essential oils with
your fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just touch them in one spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them a squeeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how they feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them a visual look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they getting funky from being in the
dark too long?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you water them and then move them to
the dark and close them up in a room that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't have enough airflow and now you've
got mildew happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smell your fingers after you squeeze the
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if it still smells good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the smell getting better or worse?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you happy with what is happening while
those plants are left in the dark?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're happy with what's happening,
leave them in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also keep it kind of cool in that dark
room because that's going to lead to my
[SPEAKER_00]: next part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another big advantage to keeping our
plants in the dark for several hours
[SPEAKER_00]: before harvest is the light, degrades
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light and heat starts cooking off our
terpenes so if we've got them in the dark,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the cool, we can develop more terps in
our plants right before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dark and the cool are best for
trichomes and terpenes and that's what we
[SPEAKER_00]: are after.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want essential oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want those terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want the best quality product we can
get and the dark is the best environment
[SPEAKER_00]: for that preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dark, cool environment is the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Warm and moist starts ruining our product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, the short answer is yes,
I do like a dark period before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The how long kind of depends on how much
space I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I have a space I can utilize for this
dark period?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I have more plants coming along?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, what type of plant am I growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of this is going to be a trial and
error sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, your wider leaf,
more beefy, chunky, more dense indica
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties are going to like this a little
bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tropical sativas may not respond as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would suggest is you take the
strain you were working with and if you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got multiple plants, put one in the dark
for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get another one, put it in the dark for 48
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get another one, put it in the dark for 72
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you're going to have to do that
backwards because the longer one's got to
[SPEAKER_00]: go in first but you get my point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put three plants in the dark for different
intervals and see if there are any
[SPEAKER_00]: noticeable differences in your final
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did the trichomes develop a little more
density on that one you left in the dark?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did one get more dense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did one smell better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did one start to get funky?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did one just start to die?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did one degrade too quickly in the dark?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the plants, pay attention
to the trichomes, pay attention to the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, give them a squeeze, smell your
fingers, smell the buds up close,
[SPEAKER_00]: use a scope if you've got one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a little personal science experiment to
find out what works best for you and your
[SPEAKER_00]: specific cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to be able to give you more
guidance on things like this but
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes, a lot of times, these things
are very plant-specific, very
[SPEAKER_00]: strain-specific, very cultivar-specific at
a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to tell you exactly what to
do because I'm not sure where your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: is from, I'm not sure how your plant's
going to react.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of variables that could
happen in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to wrap that one up, yes, I do like a
dark period, somewhere between 24 and 72
[SPEAKER_00]: hours depending on the availability of
space, also plant-dependent,
[SPEAKER_00]: strain-dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing to think about is
environment in your dark room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just throwing those plants in a
closet like some people do, you need some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of airflow in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine you just watered your plants,
you lock them in a closet, you close the
[SPEAKER_00]: door, all that humidity and moisture has
to go somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got big fat chunky buds in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to create mold on your
finished buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the last 48 hours and you just ruined
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have some airflow in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't set yourself up for failure at the
end of the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another thing to keep in mind is these
plants are going to be stinky at this
[SPEAKER_00]: point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wherever you trap them for this 24,
48 or 72 hour dark period, when you open
[SPEAKER_00]: it up, it is going to be pungent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe be prepared for some type of odor
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe don't do this on a time when you're
expecting company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you live really close to your
neighbors, have some sort of odor control,
[SPEAKER_00]: odor prevention in place before this
harvest time comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest is the stinkiest part of the
entire grow process and it is about to
[SPEAKER_00]: start when you put these plants in.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so that is my rant on putting
plants into the dark before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you again for the great
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's move on to one more email before
we start wrapping up this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This email goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Jeff, my name is, and I'm going to
skip his name, but then it continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from Albuquerque, New Mexico and I
follow your podcast and Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been growing with my PPL now for
about two and a half years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a personal production license.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I remember correctly down there in New
Mexico, you have to get a personal
[SPEAKER_00]: production license.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to get allowed by your landlord.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of steps to be able to
have a home grow in New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to this guy for making
the steps and getting it done.
[SPEAKER_00]: He continues to say, you're doing an
awesome job with your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, I like listening in the morning
before work and on the way to work with
[SPEAKER_00]: very good information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have some Raphael seeds I need to
pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a question about vegging my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is too long to veg your plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is eight to nine weeks too long to veg?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get my plants big for a nice
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the older the plants get,
the more prone they are to pests and
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: My veg tent is pretty small, about four
feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my flower tent is about six feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you in advance and keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rocking the podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey dude, thanks for all the great
compliments in there and thanks for
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about veg times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can veg your plants as long as you
want, as long as works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did say in the message that,
you know, older plants get more prone to
[SPEAKER_00]: pests and diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as long as you take care of the
plants, they aren't very prone to pests or
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the new strains are bred with
resistant genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you've got some stuff that's
been bred by a reputable breeder that
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't really prone to getting pests and
diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we talk about vegging quickly
and flowering early to get away from the
[SPEAKER_00]: pests and diseases is because people
simply bring problems to the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that the plants themselves are
prone to getting a disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that we just want to minimize the
time for a new grower having a garden to
[SPEAKER_00]: minimize the risk of any trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's law enforcement, if it's pests,
if it's a plant disease, we want the
[SPEAKER_00]: quickness just to prevent a problem
because the grower usually brings the
[SPEAKER_00]: problems himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to give you some respect as
a grower and say that you are on top of
[SPEAKER_00]: your integrated pest management system and
you will not be bringing pests and
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens into your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you should be able to veg your plants
as long as you need to without any
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you do go on to say that your veg
space is four feet tall and your flower
[SPEAKER_00]: tent is about six feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that when you put your plants
into flower, they do have the potential to
[SPEAKER_00]: double in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you wanted to veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: You asked if eight or nine weeks was too
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too long to veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were probably going to have quite tall
plants by the end of eight weeks of veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about 60 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally veg a smaller plant in a tent
for about 30 days before I put it into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, maybe 45 days at the most because
they tend to get a little tall in the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: tents, especially if you need to leave
room for the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what type of light you're
running, but we do need a gap between the
[SPEAKER_00]: light and the tops of the buds because we
don't want to burn them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that optimal light space is just a
little distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Away from the actual bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind when you are vegging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're going outdoors,
you can veg those plants as big as you
[SPEAKER_00]: want or need them to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not uncommon for people to start
cracking seeds in January or December or
[SPEAKER_00]: even earlier than that for a California
outdoor style grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll crack your seeds around
Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll run a little crop from those seeds,
find your females out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you will take clones of those good
females and you'll start vegging them in
[SPEAKER_00]: January.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll veg them all through February,
veg them through March under lights
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors, under a thousand watt lights
indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting giant beefy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Veg them through April, top them a bunch
of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in May in California, the end of May,
you can put them outdoors and they get
[SPEAKER_00]: gigantic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you see those big 12 and 20
foot tall cannabis plants as they were
[SPEAKER_00]: vegged indoors for several months before
they were put outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in theory, as long as you are not
restricted by space, you can veg those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to be monsters.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a big enough pot to sustain
your root ball, if you're able to have
[SPEAKER_00]: enough ceiling space, if you're outdoors,
you can veg those plants unlimited as long
[SPEAKER_00]: as you are able to sustain their root ball
and the plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: In an indoor environment, you're basically
limited by light height or ceiling height
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever type of height or width or
size restrictions you've got indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can veg a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a trellis, you could
probably fill a 25 by 25 room with one
[SPEAKER_00]: plant if you were super patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't recommend it, but it is a
possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something you could do if you wanted
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you could veg infinitely if you
can maintain the root ball and if you can
[SPEAKER_00]: keep the plant healthy and if you can keep
the bugs and problems away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, we're the ones that
bring the problems most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in theory, you should be able to veg a
cannabis plant infinitely if you have got
[SPEAKER_00]: the proper ceiling and light and light
height.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, the plants will get so tall
that if you were in an indoor environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: you won't be able to get any light
penetration, but outdoors, the sun
[SPEAKER_00]: penetrates all the way through,
you get a lot of light penetration from
[SPEAKER_00]: the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately with the sun,
we do run out of season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants will go into flower once the
sun tells them that it is time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my long rant about veg times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure that when you veg your
plants indoors for your tent, that you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't go too long because you don't want
to grow up into the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, keep in mind that some cultivars
will double in height by the time they are
[SPEAKER_00]: done flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were doing a phenol hunt,
I recommend flowering early for your first
[SPEAKER_00]: run just to find out if you've got a
phenotype that gets ridiculously tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just did a phenol hunt and I found one
plant that grew twice as tall as all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the other plants within the first 30 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to move it to a different room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the plants are up to my knee.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant goes up to my mid chest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is in the same environment,
same condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what went on with this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not even get to finish because it
is going out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for that first run, I recommend
flowering a little bit early to find out
[SPEAKER_00]: what you've got, know what to expect and
then in your subsequent runs, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can set your veg time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will be able to dial in your veg time
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know that when they're this tall,
I need to flower because they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: finish at this height.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you develop a relationship with that
specific cultivar, you'll know exactly how
[SPEAKER_00]: long to veg.
