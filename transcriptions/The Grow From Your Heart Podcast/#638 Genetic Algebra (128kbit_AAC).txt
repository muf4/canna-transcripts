[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks and big shout out to everybody
who continues to support the show on
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not already supporting the show
and you would like to learn how to do so,
[SPEAKER_00]: all you've got to do is visit www.patreon
.com forward slash Grow From Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I did include that link in the
show notes and the video description to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it super easy for all of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to thank everybody who sent me
an update, sent me a message, gave me a
[SPEAKER_00]: heads up that there is a problem with the
podcast on Apple Podcasts, Stitcher Radio,
[SPEAKER_00]: Spotify.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those services have been having a
technical issue with my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is partially my fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is partly Bluehost's fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bluehost did an update.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something in that update messed up my
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't care about the details.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I do know that the website either
has been or is messed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's fixed by the time
this episode comes out at recording time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is like halfway fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed like it worked, but it was still
kind of funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something was weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I cannot fix, upload, correct,
adjust episodes on that service right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully by the time this comes out,
we'll have some progress, but thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: for the heads up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize that the episodes are not
or were not available on the service in
[SPEAKER_00]: which you rely.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that ever happens again, please do not
be shy to notify me to give me a heads up
[SPEAKER_00]: that, hey, your podcast is broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that's how I find out that there
is an episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me know the episodes that have
disappeared or will not play will be
[SPEAKER_00]: posted soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything will be back to normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're hearing this, then it's probably
fixed in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not able to find the episodes
on Spotify, Apple podcast, Stitcher radio,
[SPEAKER_00]: any of those services, simply check out
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, YouTube has been reliable knock on
wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube is keeping us up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't taken any videos down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to talk any further about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we disappear on the audio services,
please do check out YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've checked that out by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe you're just missing shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you hear this in the future because
you've been missing episodes, I apologize
[SPEAKER_00]: that you missed a few episodes,
but please do catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The episodes will be back in the feed as
soon as we get things corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just takes time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I got a wonderful web friend,
a web guy working on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my web guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if he wants his name said out
loud or anything, but thank you,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He interrupted his vacation to work on my
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the awesome kind of dude he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do I want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: The secret stash seed exchange on May
22nd.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking about groovy gravy
presents the secret stash seed exchange in
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver, Colorado on May 22nd.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been saying that most of the slots
are sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they did add another time slot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that this event is working,
people are being given a certain amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: time to move through the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get to see all of the vendors who
get to see all of the exhibits and then
[SPEAKER_00]: your time slot will be up in a new group
of people will move into the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is to adhere to COVID restrictions to
keep everybody safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically just to be able to be allowed to
have a building or an event in a building.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the types of restrictions we
need to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point is they have added a full
another time slot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're trying to get tickets and the
time you wanted wasn't available or if
[SPEAKER_00]: something wasn't working, now is the time
to check back at the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: The website is in the link in the show
notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the video description.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you send me a message, I'll make sure
to get you a link.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also use coupon code Rasta Jeff that will
save you 20% off your general admission
[SPEAKER_00]: ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say this again because I'm
still getting messages about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe because the podcast is broken and
some people can't listen to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I cannot help you with booth space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is too late for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The place is full.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot help you with VIP tickets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are long sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I can't help you with any access to
the event or tickets to the event or any
[SPEAKER_00]: VIP hookups other than that coupon code
Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize for the clearing of the
throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been smoking a little bit of rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to go heavier in the lungs and
throat, but good in stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to my buddy, Perp got me nice
and heavily medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I talked about all the important
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I want to talk about on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been seeing people talking on
Facebook, social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I scroll too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm trying to relax a little bit,
possibly pooping.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's talk about what I saw on social
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: People ask often, what nutrients should I
be using for an outdoor grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to address this in another
question here soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing you should be using in an
outdoor grow, something I would recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: is I wouldn't go with the bottled
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go with amended soil and put that
plant right in the amended soil and then
[SPEAKER_00]: feed it water and teas and top dress it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't focus on bottled nutrients outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be a fiasco.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, I think it would be more
beneficial to focus on building a soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: having a starter soil, then amend that as
time goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Top dress, feed it teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then mainly you just got to keep it wet
and things will be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes to the best nutrients for
an organic outdoor grow, I would just
[SPEAKER_00]: build that amended soil and rock with some
super soil or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm not the organics expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are plenty of people out there doing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plenty of people out there who can give
you great organics advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Refer to those folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that is not my area of expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not want to mess you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about all the stuff I wanted
to cover the top of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I covered the news.
[SPEAKER_00]: I covered the social media stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw let's jump into the main topics of
this podcast, which is of course the
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: This portion of portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the word I'm looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this segment, let's just say segment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the other word I tried to say did
not work.
[SPEAKER_00]: This segment of the podcast is brought to
you by my friend, the can of crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my buddy, the can of
crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't use corporate sponsors here at
the grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We let our friends be the sponsors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the can of crap for all the
continued support, not just grow from your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart podcast, but also the IRA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics support.
[SPEAKER_00]: The IRA army wouldn't be what it is
without my friend, the can of crap,
[SPEAKER_00]: big salute brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this first message came from my
friend, lemur priest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, big shout out to lemur priest,
captain and commander of the IRA army.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got stoned and started reading stuff on
seed packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to kind of cut his message
short because he wrote like multiple pages
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think he had a couple too many dads
maybe, but we're going to kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: paraphrase what my buddy lemur said.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make a good message out of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I got an idea about reading the
listed lineages of cultivars on seed packs
[SPEAKER_00]: and websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get to the topic of this
here of what he's actually talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey rasta, Jeff, I'm humbled by
your, uh, by the community built around
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast and your seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been able to meet so many amazing
growers from all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everyone knows that there was a time
that sharing knowledge tips or helping
[SPEAKER_00]: someone else in their cannabis grow and
anyway, it was a big no-no between being
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal at the time and mostly being used
as a way for someone to make or save money
[SPEAKER_00]: and the investment of learning how to grow
relatively on your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were lots of incentives not to share
tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, why would I teach you how
to grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm the weed grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make all the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would I give you part of the pie part
of the game?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could buy it for me and then resell it
if you want, but I'm not going to teach
[SPEAKER_00]: other people how to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: That used to be the mindset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's why it took me a long time to
cave in and get into commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to go teach other people my
tricks for an hourly wage.
[SPEAKER_00]: That didn't feel right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yes, I was illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people couldn't know other people
were going to cut in on your market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we couldn't share tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, yes, we are in a state,
a realm, a time, an area, a community
[SPEAKER_00]: where we could just share the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel it's kind of my duty to share
the knowledge that I've learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the gift of gab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously I just cannot shut up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't stop talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm passionate about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want you guys to be as good of a
grower as me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to enjoy cannabis as much as I
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like it's my, my duty to come
out here and share this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, it says, I remember getting lots
of strange skeptical looks from grower
[SPEAKER_00]: friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I would offer advice and tips,
they would tell me it's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would help them improve their plants
because, uh, they would have better herb
[SPEAKER_00]: and make more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, I was only thinking about
helping plants be happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it's all about, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make the plants happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: The person that grows it is happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: The person that smokes it is happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow from your heart, breed with love.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he does talk a lot here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend is a teacher.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, I love teaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, we're going to kind of skip a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could ask for advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot he goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the peanut butter breath batter
has me ranting and sentimental.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it does brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to cut out several paragraphs of
what you were saying, but I got nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: but love for you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a good question in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as I'm looking over my seed
collection, reading the different parents,
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed how some can be a little
confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you're not immersed in the cannabis
world, things can be confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics does a wonderful job of
either using cultivars with names or
[SPEAKER_00]: naming them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you created them.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, some breeders are not so helpful
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, when I cross stuff, I try to represent
the parent names and the cross in some
[SPEAKER_00]: way, shape or form, or I try to put the
cross on the package really clearly so
[SPEAKER_00]: that you know what I'm working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says sometimes a new cultivar isn't
something that is released and only used
[SPEAKER_00]: for breeding purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that happens, this is when many of
the parentheses are used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you walk us through some of the
things we could see?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they mean for the way they were
bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this, there's a lot of talking going
on here, but I understand what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get to answering your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he does break down some examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, for example, peach OG from ethos
is peach crescendo, two millions of
[SPEAKER_00]: peaches to quattro Kush F three,
how the three cultivars are across to make
[SPEAKER_00]: peach OG and how is it different then?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he listened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this is, this is a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me kind of back up cause there is a
lot to talk about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also shout out to lemur for the great
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to get me talking a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is when we see multiple
strains listed on a seed package,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do we know which was the male,
which crosses were which used in that
[SPEAKER_00]: cross?
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times, basically you're going
to see strain a X strain B in basic
[SPEAKER_00]: horticultural practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: The standard is to use ladies first female
plant X male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to mean that the male plant
was the pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant listed first of the second
plant was the pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant listed first was the pollen
receiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's ladies first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so we're going to say, uh,
golden goat to daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a golden goat female, a daybreaker
male, a daybreaker pollen, pollen donor
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinated the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm stepping all over my words,
but we're going to get there together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just follow along.
[SPEAKER_00]: The daybreaker male pollinated the golden
goat female to make a rise seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you buy a rise seeds, it says,
arise then in parentheses underneath it,
[SPEAKER_00]: golden goat crossed daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's real easy to understand that that
is golden goat and daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you know that golden goat is this
like sweet, uh, candy flavored gum
[SPEAKER_00]: flavored tropical sativa kind of thing
with a nice head buzz that makes you
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking weird high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you know that the daybreaker,
maybe you know about daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, I'll tell you about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daybreaker is Chem D and Joseph OG and
it's real stinky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's got like, uh, burnt tennis balls,
burnt rubber, uh, gassy skunky foot turps,
[SPEAKER_00]: just funky, weird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some swamp ass in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a short squatty plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know both of those plants by name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if I really wanted to, I could
research both of those golden goat and
[SPEAKER_00]: daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could go further and find the
parents of each one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then even further to find their
parents and I could learn about the family
[SPEAKER_00]: tree, the genetics, the history,
the genealogy, the breakdown, the recipe,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you will, uh, for each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's real easy when you've got plant A
and plant B girl plants, a boy plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's real simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: For you, because you got two ingredients
to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're starting to see, like our
friend lemur, uh, mentioned here and
[SPEAKER_00]: pointed out to us and highlighted is that
sometimes we see, what do we got?
[SPEAKER_00]: Crescendo to millions of peaches to
Quattro Kush F3.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we know which plant is the male
pollen donor in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we got three different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those had to be a pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them had to be a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then one of those plants had to pollinate
something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you can't put three plants into one
mix like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without a parentheses and the,
what I would call the appropriate or
[SPEAKER_00]: proper place, I don't know which plant was
the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could do research, but as a seed seller
and a seed breeder, why do I want to give
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody an assignment or homework when I
could just tell you the answer on my seed
[SPEAKER_00]: pack?
[SPEAKER_00]: I could say, oh, that's the Quattro Kush
was the male or the fucking millions of
[SPEAKER_00]: peaches was the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to assume because of the way
it's listed, but you know what happens
[SPEAKER_00]: when I assume I'm going to make an asset
to everybody involved here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I would say the Quattro Kush F3 was
the pollen donor, and then probably
[SPEAKER_00]: Crescendo to millions of peaches was one
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they pollinated that with the Quattro
Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's a way that they would have made
that more clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would have been obvious and
apparent, which the male plant was a set
[SPEAKER_00]: of parentheses, just around two strain
names would indicate this is one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know the actual breakdown,
but hypothetically we've got peach
[SPEAKER_00]: Crescendo, uh, to millions of peaches to
Quattro Kush F3.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's written on two different
papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm looking back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I wanted to make it clear, which was
the male, and we're going to just assume
[SPEAKER_00]: for this project for, for words and,
uh, what we're talking about right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the Quattro Kush was the male,
I would simply put peach Crescendo to
[SPEAKER_00]: millions of peaches in a parentheses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would say, this is one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since that one plant is listed first,
uh, then the Quattro Kush listed after
[SPEAKER_00]: that, I would assume the Quattro Kush is
the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this would tell me is it is peach
Crescendo pollinated by millions of
peaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would go in one parentheses that made
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds were grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found a keeper there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is peach Crescendo to millions of
peaches in parentheses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That became one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just give that a name to make that
easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be fucking so much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a name and then you don't have to
have two different names X something I
[SPEAKER_00]: digress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so in parentheses, peach Crescendo to
millions of peaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's a female peach Crescendo
pollinated by a male millions of peaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in this case, since those two are in
the parentheses, then there's an X.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's Quattro Kush F3.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would indicate to me that the Quattro
Kush F3 pollinated that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was in the parentheses there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to be our female.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns into algebra.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a math problem, but it all
makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you start to understand it,
it makes clear, clear sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to put some stuff on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on what I can do with final cut
pro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't think that through when I said
it, but I know I'll be able to put some
[SPEAKER_00]: examples up on the screen because final
cut pro is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm getting good at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, an example of a male to female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would just be male plant or no,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucked that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: A fan, an example of a male to female
plant would be listed as female X male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Girl plant times male plant makes baby
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that easy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what if we take, what if I did not
name a rise?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if a rise just didn't get a name?
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be golden goat X daybreaker in
parentheses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what that plant would be called
because it doesn't have a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cross golden goat to daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what if we cross that to strawberry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fields to make the strawberry starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be golden goat, uh, X daybreaker
in parentheses, X strawberry fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would make the strawberry starburst
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what I said, cause I'm trying
to think all this all at once,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that would make the strawberry
starburst there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all about that parentheses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read more into lemurs,
uh, message and make sure I keep myself on
[SPEAKER_00]: track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, how is that different from,
okay, how is the, uh, peach OG from ethos?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is that different than, uh,
strawberry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me that in this first set of
parentheses, we've got forum cut,
[SPEAKER_00]: girls got cookies crossed to the purple
Panti dropper.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they listed that correctly,
if they followed industry standards,
they looked at that, the people of the
industry, the names of the people of the
complete industry, their family.
If you follow the industry standards,
that means the person you're trying to
think of is probably going to be the
person that's going to be trying to think
of the team that's been going to do it for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a forum cut Girl Scout cookies
female which is clone only so that would
[SPEAKER_00]: make sense that that's a female clone Only
is a whole another fucking can of worms to
[SPEAKER_00]: open up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got this forum cut cookies Pollinated
by a purple panty dropper that made one
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that was grown They found to keep
her out of that plant in this scenario It
[SPEAKER_00]: was female because it is listed first that
was pollinated by a male Romulan plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got parentheses starting
parentheses, right forum cut Girl Scout
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookies X purple panty dropper closing
parentheses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all in the set of parentheses there
X Romulan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're gonna get I'm gonna call it
purple Cookie dropper, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cuz it's fucking purple panty dropper and
Girl Scout cookies Just name that
[SPEAKER_00]: something and we can make this a lot
easier Purple cookie dropper to Romulan
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's gonna be fucking the Klingon or
some show is gonna call it Klingon Hey to
[SPEAKER_00]: see it happened that quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made a strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We named it We got rid of all the fucking
parentheses so much easier that way the
[SPEAKER_00]: next example That lemur throws at me is
how about?
[SPEAKER_00]: How how Girl Scout cookie to purple panty
dropper wasn't a name strain that was
[SPEAKER_00]: released and used in the breeding project
not to be confused Yeah, you're that's
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what I was talking about that
plant wasn't named So it doesn't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: name which makes everything confusing
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He asked about another one if you're
feeling adventurous There is snake eyes
[SPEAKER_00]: from moto rebel genetics big shout out to
moto rebel because I wanted to use snake
[SPEAKER_00]: eyes That's a really great fucking name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got storm shadow snake eyes would have
been a great accompaniment name Good work,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm glad you beat me to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not mad at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking good name I'm proud that I
wanted to use a name and somebody else had
[SPEAKER_00]: already used it means a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that one is all in parentheses and
it says GG for to kosher Kush to heroin
[SPEAKER_00]: and number one all in parentheses right
there So I don't know that I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: the male of that one I'm going to assume
it's the gorilla glue number four to
[SPEAKER_00]: kosher Kush was pollinated by the heroin
and number one But again, I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: assuming I don't know what that breeder
did there's A missing parentheses there
[SPEAKER_00]: that doesn't do anything it fucks it all
up for me to tell you the truth And then
[SPEAKER_00]: that was axed to lemon G to lemon tie
which is going to be a lemon G female
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is clone only pollinated by the
lemon thyme male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Without the correct parentheses order
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a jumbled clusterfuck of a
mess and I really don't know What was
[SPEAKER_00]: used?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that it's a GG for to kosher Kush
to hairy female pollinated by a lemon og
[SPEAKER_00]: lemon thyme male, but That GG for kosher
Kush heroin across couldn't tell you where
[SPEAKER_00]: the male was because of the way it is
listed I want to assume that the heroin
[SPEAKER_00]: was the male because it's last in that
list But I can't promise anything because
[SPEAKER_00]: this breeder didn't give me enough
information On top of the parentheses
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to see brackets occasionally
so we may have parent the bracket
[SPEAKER_00]: parentheses parentheses and then brackets
and then they're getting creative on how
[SPEAKER_00]: they do it when you when you see it it
will be I'll try to put some of that stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: up on the screen also just so you can see
what I'm talking about But that's how
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of using two sets of parentheses
because what if I took we're gonna go even
[SPEAKER_00]: further the GG for to kosher Kush to
heroin across to the lemon G to lemon tie
[SPEAKER_00]: what if I crossed that to the Forum cut
GSC to purple panty dropper to Romulan now
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got so many things with parentheses
around it I would just put the brackets
[SPEAKER_00]: around all of that to indicate It's just
one fucking thing or put it on either side
[SPEAKER_00]: to show you that It's one big thing this
to this to this is actually just it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: make sense once you see it on the screen
But sometimes you're gonna see brackets in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to confuse people That is the
next thing people are gonna see so he
[SPEAKER_00]: wraps it up with I think it's a set of
parentheses I think I think of it as Each
[SPEAKER_00]: set of parentheses as a plant and inside
is what makes it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are countless other examples It
might be easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes here any more examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna confuse people more But I
think that is the thing that needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: said inside of each parentheses Is each
plant and you can tell which plant was
[SPEAKER_00]: broken down Inside of that parentheses and
then it's crossed to the thing that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: got X's too I think you guys understand
what I'm trying to say more words on that
[SPEAKER_00]: are just going to make it more Foggy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right lemur.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I answered your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everybody else out there learned
something from that I hope I didn't just
[SPEAKER_00]: confuse you more Without seeing it on a
screen without writing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of hard to teach It's like
algebra.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta you gotta fucking follow along
with the visual aids and all that stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: all at the same time I'm gonna take a
quick drink of some coconut water and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we're gonna continue with the show Don't
think I'm gonna press pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I'm gonna edit anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just gonna make you endure this drink
with me Hydrate yourselves and we will
[SPEAKER_00]: continue with the show
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for giving me an opportunity to wet
my whistle Let's keep going here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next one is a nutrient and feeding
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said a moment ago We were going to talk
about outdoor feeding and feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person is growing indoors,
but my advice will still apply Let me
[SPEAKER_00]: start with the message It says greetings
and salutations greetings my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for joining me and thank you for
the great message It says it's been a
[SPEAKER_00]: while since my last question I hope this
finds you in the entire army.
[SPEAKER_00]: I re army safely and doing wonderfully in
the desire of wanting to become a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: tester for you down the road I've been
happily and diligently working toward
[SPEAKER_00]: dialing in my grow room Here are some
parameters and then we do go over quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: few parameters Which I will touch on as I
answer the actual question We don't need
[SPEAKER_00]: to read all of the parameters a lot of the
question will leave Us back up there to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says first off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to be as organic of a grower as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's admirable I do appreciate and
respect that it says can you see any flaws
[SPEAKER_00]: or possible deficiencies in my soil and
liquid selections and can you make any
[SPEAKER_00]: suggestions So we've got a good soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got nature's living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got bud swell We got recharge and we've
got happy frog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not absolutely certain of any of the
organic Certifications of any of those
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely don't know about recharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about happy frog I think bud
swell is organic, but I can't promise you
[SPEAKER_00]: that any of those are are actually organic
products Look for an Omri listing on the
[SPEAKER_00]: package.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my advice there then bud swell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that's organic That's just
bottled a fucking bat guano to the best of
[SPEAKER_00]: my knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got elementally green big buds I don't
know what that product is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not research that one Then we list
two products that concern me right away
[SPEAKER_00]: turpinator I Don't think I'm going to
assume and we've talked about assuming
[SPEAKER_00]: once in this episode maybe twice I'm going
to assume that turpinator is not an
[SPEAKER_00]: organic product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be I could be completely fucking
wrong But from what I remember what I see
[SPEAKER_00]: on that bottle and I'm looking at it
through memory That's not organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might want to read about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got cow mag is your next
liquid Which cow mag there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: brands out there a lot of different
products available Some may be organic,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's gonna be hard to find a straight
pure liquid organic Cow mag solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've never looked for a purely
organic cow mag that could be a challenge
[SPEAKER_00]: So it depends on the brand make sure
you're checking that Omri listing for
[SPEAKER_00]: organics on your cow mag So the turpinator
the cow mag those are the things that I
[SPEAKER_00]: would question Everything else you
mentioned in here seems to make sense for
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow The only thing you're not the
only goal you're not reaching is that
[SPEAKER_00]: complete organic desire?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that you're getting now with
your list now I said this on the other
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about the outdoor growth That I saw
on social media people are asking about
[SPEAKER_00]: what to grow with outdoors so they can
stay completely organic Which bottled
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients should they buy what product
should they use?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna repeat what I said about that If
you're going to grow completely
[SPEAKER_00]: organically and you don't want to do salts
and synthetic nutrients Why not just go
[SPEAKER_00]: with the full-on organic amended soil the
way that nature would have done it go no
[SPEAKER_00]: till go super soil go something like that
get all of the things that would go into
[SPEAKER_00]: the dirt and get a big tarp and put it on
the garage floor makes up a couple of bags
[SPEAKER_00]: of Whatever soil is available right now
damn it soil and dirt are hard to get
[SPEAKER_00]: right now you guys I've been to the the
grow store a couple of grow stores to get
[SPEAKER_00]: products and soil is low But I get the
soil is mixed the soil that you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: and then mix in all of the proper
Amendments nutrients there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different ways to mix up a super soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make this disclaimer often I do not
claim to be an organic grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am NOT a super soil expert I could tell
you the basics But there are plenty of
[SPEAKER_00]: websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are plenty of things on the internet
that will get you building a great super
[SPEAKER_00]: soil They don't pay me to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't sponsor me But build a soil
calm will be a great start for building an
[SPEAKER_00]: organic soil and amended soil So what I
would do I'd skip all the bottles I would
[SPEAKER_00]: skip all this shit and I would mix up in a
mended super soil some sort of build a
[SPEAKER_00]: soil some sort of Ready-mix soil that you
could put those plants in then all you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got to feed them is maybe a top dress
between phases maybe like At the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: veg give them a top dress right at the
start of flower Top dress right as they
[SPEAKER_00]: start to bloom a specific top dress as
they're going if they're getting bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: give them a specific bloom booster top
dress I'm not the fucking organic guy So I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know what to even tell you to top
dress or tea teas would be a good idea
[SPEAKER_00]: feed them some teas But if you want to go
completely organically and grow Organics
[SPEAKER_00]: and not have the bottles and all that
stuff and be sure that everything you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using is organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would buy Amendments and mix up a good
pre amended super soil It's gonna save you
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gonna take time in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna spend a day mixing it up But
then you don't have to mix up nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: every time you water and that's why to the
outdoor growers Who are looking to do
[SPEAKER_00]: something organic outdoors and want to
know what nutrients to use?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be watering Every single
day outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to spend the time to mix up?
[SPEAKER_00]: You might water 20 gallons out there Do
you want to spend time mixing up 20
[SPEAKER_00]: gallons of water worth of nutrients every
single day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you want to spend one or two days in
the garage mixing up a big fat batch of
[SPEAKER_00]: super soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your plants in that and then just
water the whole cycle because all you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got to do is keep them wet because Inside
that soil is everything that they need
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you organic growers insist that
the herb tastes better gets you higher So
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's doing that it may be worth the pre
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the difference Honestly,
I think it all gets me plenty stone
[SPEAKER_00]: nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are all growing such good weed
but my advice Would be to ditch 90% of
[SPEAKER_00]: these products if you've already got them
use them, dude Don't let me fuck up your
[SPEAKER_00]: plans your ideas But if you want to stay
as organic as possible I would abandon
[SPEAKER_00]: ship on all these liquid products and I
would buy Powders boxes of stuff organic
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff when you go to the grow store when
you go to the gardening store You'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: all the boxes that you need all the dry
amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all in one area Maybe you'll go to
build a soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you'll go to your local grow shop I
recommend you go to like the local farm
[SPEAKER_00]: area the local farming store if you can if
they're not gonna bust you for growing
[SPEAKER_00]: weed because sometimes Most people know
what we're doing and they may not like the
[SPEAKER_00]: way you look so Be careful where you're
going, but shop locally if you can is what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting at give mom and pop the money
Try not to give the big boxes your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to give Amazon your money if
possible Trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I order plenty of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shop where I have to especially during a
pandemic Give me what I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the fuck I can get it but I would
get away from the bottle and stuff if if
[SPEAKER_00]: you really want to be and you said I'm
trying to be as organic of a grower as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible, bro I would really recommend no
till growing for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend super soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend some type Of living soil
growing for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not how I do it That's not what I
do But you're saying as organic as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible and that is how you get as
organic as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: No till with a worm bin and fucking a
compost pile It's really rewarding I eat a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of vegetables and a lot of ends of
vegetables end up in a bokashi bucket and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and to know that I'm making
fertilizer with my leftover food scraps
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just rewarding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you turn that into cannabis
products, you're gonna love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good way to stay as organic as
possible There are more questions to this
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says what are some considerations to
have when deciding to grow a mother plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really easy question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like falling in love If you're in
love with that plant keep it and grow it
[SPEAKER_00]: as a mother plant I always recommend every
time you grow a cannabis plant take a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone like before you put a plant into
flower get a clone because What you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing could be the most amazing medicine
you've ever grown it could work in your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow better than everything You've ever
grown it could work for your medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: could work for your wallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're a commercial grower growing
for profit Maybe this one plant works
[SPEAKER_00]: better than everything for you take a
freaking clone of everything you ever grow
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you find out that it's the hottest
fire you've got a mother plant That is how
[SPEAKER_00]: you decide to keep a mother plant if you
fell in love with it Something that sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: very crass, but this is the absolute
fucking truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot like the dating pool If you
got one option, you're gonna keep that
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna fall in love You'd be
completely fucking happy But if you got a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch to choose from the one that stands
out to you will be the mother plant You
[SPEAKER_00]: want to keep something will tell you it's
just like falling in love With a person
[SPEAKER_00]: the way I fall in love with plants is very
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see plants plants plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, look at that plant It's just the way
it happens to me just like it does with
[SPEAKER_00]: people It's like people people people damn
look at her like I'm just attracted to
[SPEAKER_00]: specific things and the plants do it just
like people do I get similar signals in my
[SPEAKER_00]: body that say that plant right there,
bro That is the one you want to pick
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'm wrong most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm right being a breeder being a Seed
selector being a commercial cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to see a lot Of plants and I get to
make a lot of selections and I'm getting
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty damn good at it I think so
Considerations to have when deciding to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a good plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did that plant work well for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it meet all of your goals?
[SPEAKER_00]: People ask me.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I pick for a phenotype?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick the shit that you want in your garden
Did it smell the way you want that it
[SPEAKER_00]: tastes the way you wanted to give you the
buzz you want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it flower in a timely manner?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it work well for your grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did all the other plants in the room get
powdery mildew except that one that all
[SPEAKER_00]: the other plants get hit by Mites except
that one did all the other plants herm out
[SPEAKER_00]: except that one or all the other plants
like sevens But this one's a nine that
[SPEAKER_00]: nine is your keeper mother plant,
bro So as long as it's a good plant as
[SPEAKER_00]: long as it makes you happy and you want to
grow it again And keep it around that is a
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look for in a mother plant You're
basically just preserving genetics to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: it over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you love it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it successful?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it for a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says lastly as a grower How
different how difficult is it to create an
[SPEAKER_00]: auto flower strand?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know autos are not necessarily your bag
But I'm asking about what process would
[SPEAKER_00]: entail in general to create auto flower
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question I am NOT an auto
flower maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything I say right now is kind of
Partially coming out of my ass just a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit But I know enough about
breeding and I know enough about seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: that I can cover this I feel like To make
an auto flower you need an auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need at least one auto flower so get a
pack of auto flower seeds would be the way
[SPEAKER_00]: to do that now because Auto flowers you
can't clone them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna flower that clone is the
same age as the original plant which it
[SPEAKER_00]: came from They're both gonna flower at the
same time to the best of my understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're gonna have to get a pack of auto
flower seeds I recommend feminized auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers if you can get them I think most
of the people making them are doing fems
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get you an auto flower feminized seed
pack then grow them then To create an auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flower strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need auto flower to fucking have
auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need that Trait to start with you
can't make Orange stuff without some
[SPEAKER_00]: orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're gonna need an auto flower plant
in the mix so get an auto flower plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: then get a regular plant and then you need
to Select most of us are gonna get a
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized auto flower So you're gonna have
to get pollen from a regular male plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and then pollinate your auto flowers Those
auto flowers are gonna make seeds That is
[SPEAKER_00]: your f1.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a real f1.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a brand new cross a fucking
auto flower to a photo period You've just
[SPEAKER_00]: made a really unstable sloppy fucking
crazy Really high-end variation f1 Find
[SPEAKER_00]: two of those that auto flower You got to
find a male and a female that auto flower
[SPEAKER_00]: at this point The only way you're gonna
know is to grow them and they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: auto flower So once you found the male and
female that meet the criteria you want
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got the shape and structure aroma
the traits you desire the leaf shape and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot for your goal They're auto
flowering you see them start to auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flower breed that male to that Female now
you've got f2 They're not going to carry
[SPEAKER_00]: that auto flower trait until we get to
about f5 f6 Maybe f7 so you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have to keep doing this process Grow the
seeds out find a male and a female to
[SPEAKER_00]: begin to auto flower on you put them in a
room Let them pollinate each other get the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds out find grow those seeds and veg
find plants that meet the criteria You're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for plant shape plant structure
stem rub smell Let them start flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: when they get into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let that male pollinate that female We're
probably at what now I have to f3 keep
[SPEAKER_00]: going until we get to f6 by then By then
they should start coming out more uniform
[SPEAKER_00]: more uniform each time Another way you can
do it is by reversing that auto flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that is a whole nother ballgame We're
going to reverse the auto flower plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make pollen you put that pollen on
another plant Hopefully a female that is
[SPEAKER_00]: auto flowering that's going to increase
your chances of getting more auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering more quickly Again, I am NOT an
auto flower breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly how many filial
generations it would take to Solidify that
[SPEAKER_00]: auto flower trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think by selfing a couple of things you
could probably lock it in Maybe back
[SPEAKER_00]: crossing or something But I think by going
forward and filial generation and just
[SPEAKER_00]: finding auto flower trait auto flower
trait auto flower trait That's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: lock it in that's probably the best way to
do it all the other traits have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary at that point that in my opinion
Is why a lot of people find that auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers are inferior?
[SPEAKER_00]: Our first trait that we're searching for
most of the time is potency and quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going for potency terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after that we think about Problems
like is it resistant to bugs resistant to
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it handle the room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, but most of the time we go for
potency and Terps and auto flowers the
[SPEAKER_00]: main thing the main trait We're looking
for is auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything else is secondary in my
opinion take that with a grain of salt you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys because like I said, I'm not the Auto
flower guy all of what I just said Came
[SPEAKER_00]: out my ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

that.

knowledgeable.

[SPEAKER_00]: I understand breeding enough to have
advice on that But again take that with
[SPEAKER_00]: the big stinky grain of salt All right.
