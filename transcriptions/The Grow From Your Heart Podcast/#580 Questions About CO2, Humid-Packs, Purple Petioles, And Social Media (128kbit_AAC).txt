[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 580 of the Grow
From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been taking dabs of TKD number 10
live batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of Chem D and Triangle
Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying to take a dab and
experience the flavor before I read the
[SPEAKER_00]: label and let the label influence my
mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a dab and I said, wow, that tastes
like OG Kush and sour mothballs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I read the label and it says the
flavor should taste like sour,
[SPEAKER_00]: petrol, and the lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's kind of a cushy description in
there and the sour part fell in,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I got a sour, cushy mothball,
which may not sound like the most pleasant
[SPEAKER_00]: description unless you're a Kush
connoisseur and that is fucking delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I expected it to be more of a kind of a
punch to the face kind of lay me down a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, it made me kind of kind of go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got me moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got me chatty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was organizing my recording space here
real nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ever smoke those kind of concentrates?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, I'm going to record a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next thing you know, you're not recording
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're fucking organizing your space and
checking your Facebook and looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram is that kind of concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to the TKD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number 10 live batter for making a great
podcast happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, in this episode,
I'm going to read a couple of Patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: messages and emails before we get there.

of the seven 10 club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the seven 10 club, excuse me.

[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of cool names in here and that
one will never leave my brain and ill
[SPEAKER_00]: tempered sea bass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just see a giant pissed off sea bass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may be not pissed off, but ill tempered
is the right word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't smoke weed if you're a sea bass
because you're goddamn underwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you got some tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about shot me out if you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got that underwater smoke tech for
our sea bass friend, we could chill the
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know.

show notes and in the video description to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it easy for all of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see me playing with the camera,
it's because when I did that, fist bump
[SPEAKER_00]: toward the camera, it really messed up the
lighting here, trying to undo that redo
[SPEAKER_00]: that there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I may have fixed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was funny to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to watch the video to see what
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fist bumped the camera and the lighting
went to shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully it'll re auto focus for me using
the MacBook.

coming.

[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the shout outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow us on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not waste too much time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to the email portion of this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get quite chatty and quite rambly
sometimes let's not let too much of that
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first message in today's episode comes
from our friend Papa Wheely.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up Papa Wheely?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you haven't heard from me in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Rasta Jeff, it's Papa Wheely again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey funny story revelant to your outdoor
rant episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe two weeks ago, I went on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's where you screwed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went on Facebook and a group called
cannabis growing and tips or I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I don't remember when I joined but
sometimes something in a post catches my
[SPEAKER_00]: eye when I'm on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of Facebook groups that
talk about growing cannabis and consuming
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to be helpful and encouraging in
those groups, but sometimes I have to
[SPEAKER_00]: leave because there are people you can get
really, really bad advice in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a lot of what inspired this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would see a horrible advice and I said
horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get that H across the
screening and horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would see horrible, terrible advice on
social media on forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly I started in the forums reading
roll it up and other forms from back in
[SPEAKER_00]: the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would just see people say like,
well, spray that client with gasoline and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be like, wait, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would mean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd think that it's a really good thing
and they're giving advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of the advice I saw was
going to compound problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it may look like you solve the
problem today, but tomorrow you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have gasoline flavored buds like so it
just drove me crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of what started this podcast
seeing that shit on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be tricky to navigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to catch up and fall back into this
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, so as soon as someone posts a
question and needs so as soon as someone
[SPEAKER_00]: posts a question and needs help,
there are like 20 plus comments almost
[SPEAKER_00]: instantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are the wrong answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are right or ask the right follow up
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing I hate is that 25 percent of
the people talk shit and make fun of the
[SPEAKER_00]: guy or his plants on his first grow or
they are just rude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's it's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to help people.
[SPEAKER_00]: People get mad at me because I ask
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say, well, what was your goal when you
fed the plants fucking humans?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you whatever you feed
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was your goal when you fed the
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just picked humans from Bob's Burgers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where that came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wondered why I pulled a strange
reference because there were humans in the
[SPEAKER_00]: burgers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But why did you feed your plants fucking
mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did you pour kombucha in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was your goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I asked him that, they're like,
well, who do you think you are?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, you're on social media asking
for grow advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to know why you're what your
goal is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe I can steer you in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, people are confrontational and
really ridiculous and boastful and
[SPEAKER_00]: territorial on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, so a guy posted last week asking
what was going on with his plants in a
[SPEAKER_00]: pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking heat stress, but couldn't
tell for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But me and most of the growers are having
the same issue right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, because it's hot outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: These people ripped him apart because he's
about posting such a shitty plant and all
[SPEAKER_00]: sorts of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't it sad?
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you go look at those people
talking shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're even worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're even sadder.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't realize they've got fucking
spider mites everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my plants look amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you look like you've got spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got more fucking spider mites than
weed in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the people that are talking shit
usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, but me and most of the growers
are where am I now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost my spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I responded to the guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, what you need to do is join
cannabis or listen and join the grow from
[SPEAKER_00]: your heart podcast or the DGC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for reaching out to somebody
on social media and letting them know
[SPEAKER_00]: about the podcast and about resources that
are available to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't even know that we
exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do a lot of podcast advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are my advertisers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The word of mouth that you provide the
algorithms on iTunes or Apple podcasts and
[SPEAKER_00]: Stitcher and Spotify.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are where I'm advertised and big
shout out to the dude grows crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys give me a lot of advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, Scotty real, the dude guru,
everybody behind the scenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give me a lot of support.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I get a lot of advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of follows come from the dude grows
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to reciprocate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're following my show and you
have not listened to the dude grows show,
[SPEAKER_00]: the dude grows podcast, wherever you were
listening to me, that show is available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to go listen to the dude
grow show, very friendly show,
[SPEAKER_00]: same spirit, same idea, same goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want you to listen to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want you to grow better cannabis and
have a good time doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't feel any rivalry, any
competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are my bros.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoke together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a different show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different style.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different format.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's multiple dudes there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just usually the one of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had Mike on the show a couple of
times, which we may want to address here
[SPEAKER_00]: while we're talking, but yeah,
mainly just me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a totally different vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a different approach to growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they've got a different approach
to growing sometimes, but all that
[SPEAKER_00]: information will add up and then you can
use what works best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna get back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, fucking rambly from the dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, make sure you follow the dude
grows crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dude grows show great people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The DGC, when I say DGC, that means dude
grows crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the group of people that follows
the dude grows show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call the irie genetics followers,
the irie army.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if the podcast folks are the
irie army as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be irie army if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've never given them an official name,
but let's keep on moving because dabs and
[SPEAKER_00]: rambles anyway, because this community and
Facebook blows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the community on Facebook can blow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to let it get to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes you do the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like you just got in a fight with
your girlfriend or you just got a shitty
[SPEAKER_00]: text from work or something where you just
close the app and throw your phone down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, ah, like, Facebook makes me
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only app that I get that
feeling from when I just go, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I seriously facepalm like fucking and
everyone's like, what's wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, it's just Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I stay off of there a little bit
because I don't need to poison myself with
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to put up a big filter when I'm
doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, um, I'm not perfect, but fuck
people like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to say fuck certain people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, fuck people that are like that
on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, no, hug a hater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give people like that a big hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just send them smiley emojis and be cool
with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to change no matter what
we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can hate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every village has its idiot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every village has its asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody's got to be that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as it's not you, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I could never even I could never
even break someone's balls without at
[SPEAKER_00]: least knowing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: People are so comfortable breaking your
balls on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that episode that Mike and I put
out, we got our balls broken over the
[SPEAKER_00]: internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, having 500 episodes under my
belt, London, a nice following on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do Instagram lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been at this for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on Periscope before Periscope was
popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing this for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can handle some trolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not asking for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying troll me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the messages and the the non
encouraging words, that's what I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to say that we got on YouTube and emails
from the last show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, people, they're keyboard warriors.
[SPEAKER_00]: When there's no face to face contact,
they'll say whatever the fuck they think
[SPEAKER_00]: they can say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they will they don't say that shit
when you're in the same room with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's way different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says there's a lot of that out there
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one wants to be the one who doesn't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's 50 replies, chances are it
got covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, the useful information
gets buried by all of the bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will post a link to the podcast and
three or four sentences about what we can
[SPEAKER_00]: do for your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll just get you got to filter
through to even find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's feed it vinegar, spray it with fire,
dip it in bleach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's my useful answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just gets overlooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people laugh at me for giving
useful advice like your hippie magic won't
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: My commercial fucking grower, bro,
I do commercial consultations,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you should pay me for the fucking
sentence I just posted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't even enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we're gonna keep going, it says,
but you would be surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people just argue with whatever the
other guy said, then someone says,
[SPEAKER_00]: then it's time to battle on the guy
posting is stuck there with no answer and
[SPEAKER_00]: confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he is racist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's, that's fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it turns into the F Trump.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I shouldn't even have said that
sentence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may bleep that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it turns into the anti Trump.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it also turns into that guy being
racist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it just continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that is social media, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, usually I make a bunch of notes on my
paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I print out your email, I write a
couple of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't I don't just blindly go into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got something to say after it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I wrote on your message was,
Yep, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I got for you, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a large part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said this why I started this podcast
because it's hard to filter through the
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshit on the internet, you don't have
to have any qualifications, any
[SPEAKER_00]: documentation, no licensing, no
regulations, you could post whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: want on the internet, and some people will
believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where we are with society today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not just cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the whole damn world.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my buddy, Papa, Willie,
I want to thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, you're having a tough time on
social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let it get to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that that is the place where I
don't know, it's just where all the
[SPEAKER_00]: nonsense happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real stuff is happening here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real people that care.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not doing that to each other when
we're talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang out with some real folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sound like a great person,
a great guy, you got a good head on your
[SPEAKER_00]: shoulders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let social media get to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're trying to referee in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like trying to herd kittens
refereeing on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to let it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just do your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people want to listen to you,
maybe start your own group.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people, you'll get a following of
people that realize you know what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about, and they'll listen to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll ask you questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that little bit will make the fucking
face punch feeling that you get from
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make all of that go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll balance it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make it feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get a little bit of reward to go
with the face punch is what I think I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Papa Willy, thank you for the
great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep going because this is
going to be a long show if I don't focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from used to be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, brother?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a bunch of great messages from a
bunch of familiar friends in this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one goes, Hey, Rosted Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's see, there's some parts we can
skip here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't use my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just call you used to be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a cool alias for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I'm sorry, we weren't able to
meet during your recent trip to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, what a breath of fresh air,
fresh breath, breath of fresh air to be in
[SPEAKER_00]: the mountains where everyone wore masks in
public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you were up there getting fresh air,
no mask, no social distancing because
[SPEAKER_00]: there were no other people up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you had a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I missed you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You understand what was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually commented on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to bring people into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually says here, Scotty real said on
the show that I had a tooth pulled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I had a little bit of dental work
done and I was unable to hang out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: tooth came out the same day you were in
town.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in no mood for company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize that dentist kicked my ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here we are now hanging out on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dentist didn't kick my ass that it was he
did a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: But goddamn, that sucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, go to the dentist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I have three questions for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll try to be brief three questions,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'll do them all just to spoil
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said I had a plant herm in my flower
tent with other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was during week six.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the worst fucking time for herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says it was not one of yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says of which I have two GGs and one
log.
[SPEAKER_00]: Funny thing, when I read that the first
time I had to rack my brain, I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the fuck is log?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just gave up and moved on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just hit me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's liberation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, gee, I had to stop thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the information just fell right out of
the sky to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: GG, of course, is probably the golden
goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I've inspected my other plants and
I don't think it was seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's almost harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe I skated by this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I wondered how long does pollen
stay viable when it has been released with
[SPEAKER_00]: my other plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to be environmentally
dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll probably sit around in the open for
like a month, maybe longer, maybe six,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe eight weeks, depending on the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heat will destroy and break down your
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cold will preserve your pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humidity and moisture destroy pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've had it 50, 60 percent
humidity in that room, that pollen is
[SPEAKER_00]: getting deactivated a little bit more
every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got it up to 70 or 80 percent in
there, the pollen is starting to cake
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's turning weird colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be any good anymore
after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't touch it, I'm going to
say it's probably good if you just if you
[SPEAKER_00]: just dumped pollen right here on the desk
and left it there and left it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This room stays pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not too hot because I got sneakers
and seeds in here as I try to keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both like the cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of like it cool, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that pollen would stay on the desk
for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could tell when it starts changing
colors and getting bad on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that'll take a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can keep pollen in the fridge for a
long, long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it in the crisper drawer in the
fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it put in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: When stored properly, pollen will stay for
a long, long time out in the open.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say depending on your
environment, two to six, maybe eight weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: max.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not saying like completely active
lots of bunches of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you could have it's like you could
have just a little fucking pollen is tiny,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, tiny pollen is you'd have just
one little grain of pollen somewhere that
[SPEAKER_00]: could still be active after a few weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no science to back that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is debatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is debated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it sticks around for quite a
while if we don't fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have humidity, if you've got wind
and moisture and a lot of varying
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures, extreme heat, that could
destroy it more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The extreme cold will preserve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, cold keeps stuff around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heat cooks things and deteriorates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It breaks it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple of weeks to a lot of weeks is
my unofficial official answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says my second question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to bill you for the second one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one was free.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second one I'm going to bill you for
says I have never used humidity packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But recently, it seems as though they are
stealing flavor from buds and long term
[SPEAKER_00]: storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your opinion on using them?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for a long time, I thought that
the humidity packs were messing up the
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor when I worked at a commercial grow,
where we were sealing stuff up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was how they did it when I came in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, sure, it seems to be
working.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I noticed everything had like a like a
watery flavor, like just straight when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're smoking it, it tasted like there
was water in the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had I've got a very sensitive pal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could taste a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you could tell by my flavor
descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I smoke concentrate,
when I smoke flowers, I could tell you if
[SPEAKER_00]: you use too much worm castings and shit
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I could taste I could taste like a wet
watery sort of a flavor in the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I wasn't smoking stuff that came
out of the humidity pack jars,
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't taste that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that stuff tasted stale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tasted bland.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all tasted the same like that watery
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my opinion, long term, extreme long
term storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it did start stealing the turps and
the flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once Mike and I took over that facility
and the harvesting and drying and curing
[SPEAKER_00]: was done in a much more controlled manner
by Mike and I, we eliminated the humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, we did our survey,
we did our method with the humidity packs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it tasted better than we got rid of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it tasted even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I concluded, in my mind,
in my theory, in my study, my unofficial
[SPEAKER_00]: study was that the humidity packs work
well for like a shorter term storage,
[SPEAKER_00]: if the product is dried and cured
properly, you've got to dry it and cure it
[SPEAKER_00]: properly to give it that effect,
then that works for like a medium storage,
[SPEAKER_00]: not a super long storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our versions of long lasting weed are
probably vastly different, but you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it around for super long in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I start thinking it steals the
turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's not like, beyond that,
like we should have smoked that like a
[SPEAKER_00]: week ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, when it gets to that point,
that's when I feel like they start ripping
[SPEAKER_00]: off the turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's dried and cured properly,
and it's just being moved from the
[SPEAKER_00]: facility to the store, and then it goes on
the shelf and sells in a few days,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel like we lose any turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's when it sits around in that container
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I feel like your turps get
stolen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually seen friends do experiments
and comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they put a fresh bud in a jar without
a humid a pack and a fresh blood in a jar
[SPEAKER_00]: with a humid a pack, the one with the
humid a pack, I'm not going to say the
[SPEAKER_00]: brand name, I did burn smoke and grind
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was like a week or two weeks that
they put it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think once you get to that four and six
six week time period, that's when your
[SPEAKER_00]: turps start kind of getting ripped off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a quick drink and then
we will answer question number three.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we've come to your last
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last question goes, I've got a
concern with red and purple stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: All three of my OG plants have developed
red stems, despite having ample magnesium
[SPEAKER_00]: in my super soil recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I know when red stems and petioles
are genetic and when they are from a
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency?
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing OG kush plants, quite often your
OG kush crosses and OG kush things will
[SPEAKER_00]: have purple leaves and purple petioles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could very well be just a genetic
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't panic too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do have some good advice for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few things that cause red and
purple petioles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got to make sure you've got red
or purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like you've got red and purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have a combo could be right in
the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hopefully my advice leads you to one
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got red and purple stems and
crunchy leaves, that is probably,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's see, where were we now?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably a phosphorus problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably got a phosphorus
deficiency, red and purple stems and
[SPEAKER_00]: crunchy leaves is a phosphorus deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's just purple, and the leaves aren't
super crunchy, that is probably your
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, your pH could be too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be causing a nutrient
deficiency and nutrient lockout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too low of a pH could make the nutrients
not absorb.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cold could be causing your petioles to
turn pinkish purple red.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the tops of the petiole is changing
colors, but the underside isn't,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is probably from cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the whole thing all the way through is
changing colors, that's going to be from
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the leaves changing colors as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: If the leaves are changing colors as well,
that is probably from low pH and also from
[SPEAKER_00]: the cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're crunchy, again, that's going to
be from phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned a minute ago that the OG Kush
varietals will do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff from the Afghanistan region will get
the purple petioles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see a lot of the, what did I used to
grow a long time?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Tora Bora used to get just straight up
purple petioles.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the Grateful Dog Cross will give
you purple petioles too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said it multiple ways because I've heard
it multiple ways and now you're still
[SPEAKER_00]: listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, something that may not have come to
your mind while you were working in the
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have done any bending, popping and
twisting or manipulation of that plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the new areas that are being
exposed to light may turn purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be a reaction to being exposed to
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parts that were going straight up,
maybe you snapped it and twisted it and
[SPEAKER_00]: bent it down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That new part that's getting light,
that may turn purple on you as a reaction
[SPEAKER_00]: or response to new light and also a little
bit of stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: The combo will add some purple onto there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a couple of options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red and purple stems with crunchy leaves
again is probably a phosphorus deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just purple petioles is probably a
magnesium problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH could be too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's something to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much potassium will block out your
magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got too much potassium in your
feed mix, your plants will not absorb the
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the opposite is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got too much CalMag,
you can give yourself a potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure that your nutrient mix is
where you need it to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if you've got crunchy leaves,
that's going to tell you it's phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's just straight up purple,
that is a magnesium problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check the pH of your solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a couple of episodes now on pH
meters and checking pH and dialing in your
[SPEAKER_00]: gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe check and make sure the pH is
accurate and that you're getting the pH of
[SPEAKER_00]: the solution you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the temperature could be a little
bit warmer in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only tell you what I suspect and
what could be options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got to go in there and do a
little investigating and see what of my
[SPEAKER_00]: options work best for you and see what you
need to correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is a phosphorus or a magnesium
issue, that is going to be very easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, oh, you said you were in super
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably make a top dress,
make a tee.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be able to pull that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a super soil or an organics
expert, so I'm going to keep my mouth shut
[SPEAKER_00]: and not say anything wrong in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, used to be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wraps it up with thanks for any help
you can give me and give your mom a hug
[SPEAKER_00]: for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise I'll take a fat dab and I'll
give my mom a hug for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, PS, I recently turned
66.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, how quickly it goes by.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy fucking birthday, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you had a marvelous birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot wait to wish you a happy 67th,
68th, and bro's 69th birthday as well and
[SPEAKER_00]: on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't wait to wish you many more happy
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy birthday, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to hear from you again soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we can figure out the issues with
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to used to be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I've got another message here
in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move right into this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says good evening rusted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff, do you want your name said?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you want your name said,
but good evening, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for reaching out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on and it says I hope this email
is finding you happy, healthy and feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am all of the above.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm reaching out today from newly
decriminalized Virginia to some to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: some questions as well as thank you for
the wealth of information you provide and
[SPEAKER_00]: for all of the work you have put into our
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a wonderful, wonderful sentence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got answers for your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for thanking me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for noticing that I put a lot
of work into the community and the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say your genetics or
community outreach and your willingness to
[SPEAKER_00]: share information are all very
inspirational and they've directly
[SPEAKER_00]: benefited me greatly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much respect, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for once again, thank you for
noticing and you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep doing what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep watching the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell more people about the show too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say my questions mainly
surrounded the usage of CO2 and commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work for a chemical detection company
and I'm looking into opportunities for
[SPEAKER_00]: synergy in your industry that I have a
personal interest in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a really viable answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says how widespread is CO2
supplementation in commercial grows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very, very viable and very
widespread.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is in almost every commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not in the commercial grow,
when I get there, I request it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the things we install almost
immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says what PPM range is generally
targeted for August?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the optimal growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with that is that CO2 can
become a little bit expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would prefer a little bit higher than
what we normally run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time we go between 900 and
1100 PPMs of CO2 in the rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to go closer to 12,
maybe 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may sound a little bit ridiculous,
but you'll see explosive fucking growth at
[SPEAKER_00]: that rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But getting a big 100 foot by 100 foot by
12 or 18 foot tall grow facility to
[SPEAKER_00]: maximize that with 1400 PPMs of CO2 for 12
hours a day is a struggle and it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We aim for the 900 to 1100 PPMs of CO2
consistently from the time the lights come
[SPEAKER_00]: on to the lights come off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want that amount of CO2 in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are things creating CO2 all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, are CO2 levels monitored at
various sites throughout a commercial grow
[SPEAKER_00]: facility?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: OSHA requires that we monitor the CO2 very
carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be installed professionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be monitored.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to have there are bright yellow
flashing lights that go off and say
[SPEAKER_00]: dangerous hazardous CO2 levels and the
alarm goes off and it will scare the shit
[SPEAKER_00]: out of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is completely loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a lot of meters, a lot of
monitors and alarms to go with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, is exposure to high levels
of CO2 a concern for workers?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because of all of the monitors and
meters and OSHA regulations that I talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about before.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it does get too high, too dangerously
high, that alarm will go off and everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: in the building will hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is as loud as the fire alarm and it's
kind of scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a really obnoxious sound to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says, I'd appreciate your input and
I look forward to the changing legislation
[SPEAKER_00]: in my state and hopefully seeing illegal
irie genetics growing in Virginia soil
[SPEAKER_00]: very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to see some photos of some stuff
growing down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, for the first time,
let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, it says, could you redact my name
and my company?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your name and company will not be said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep the email paper down here so
that nobody sees any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great question about CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did say we would talk a little bit about
how CO2 is used in a facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the state of Colorado, to the best of
my knowledge, at the last time I checked,
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 burners are illegal in a Colorado
commercial cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you cannot hang up the CO2 burner,
hook it up to the natural gas and run
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they deem that a fire hazard kind
of makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do we have got a service from a
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is called green CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see the logo in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure it's green CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to you guys if that's who you
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, if that's not who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually get big tanks installed
outside, they pour a concrete slab outside
[SPEAKER_00]: the appropriate size, depending on how
many tanks we're going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got to pour a pad outside then they
put six foot tall CO2 canisters,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the size of your rooms and
how much CO2 you're going to need.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come and do calculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got the equipment, the math to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've already done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come and do a calculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say you're going to need this much
CO2 per room per delivery time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they put tanks outside that they can
drive a big truck up that is loaded with
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 in the truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: They attach a hose to our main tanks and
it fills up all of our tanks at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just park for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watch the guy play on his phone,
fucking I don't know what he's doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: scrolling, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: The little dingy thing goes off and he
goes, oh, the shit is full.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gets out and he unplugs the cord
and he puts a little thing back in,
[SPEAKER_00]: closes up a gate, puts a lock on it
because people steal fucking everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that's outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: He waves and he drives off and my CO2 is
refilled for the next duration of time
[SPEAKER_00]: until he comes back usually about a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he came about every Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then he fills up those big tanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those big tanks run to a main line inside
of the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then each room has a controller and a
monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on that controller monitor,
you type in how much CO2 you want in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room and then it will release CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: We run lines around the perimeter of the
ceiling of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see where my tapestry is here in
the back of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll just be a line of like a plastic
line, a perforated plastic line that would
[SPEAKER_00]: go all the way around the room about the
door, the door jam height right around the
[SPEAKER_00]: doorframe there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just goes all the way around the room
and we'd run that perforated line all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way around the rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you turn on the CO2,
it just pumps through the room and that
[SPEAKER_00]: monitor reads it and it says, oh,
you're at the set the number you set and
[SPEAKER_00]: it turns it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sometimes the machines will
freeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes shit will go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes CO2 will keep coming out and
then it'll tell you you're at 2000 PPMs of
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it hits 2500, I think the alarm goes
off and you got to go outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really high number.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be like 25, it's 250,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only went off a couple of times,
but when it went off, we fucking heard it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they deliver the big tanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tanks are set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tanks run to a controller and a
monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You tell it how much you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a light sensor on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it knows when the lights are on and
when the lights are off, because we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to run CO2 during the lights off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a waste of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also not good for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got the light sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tell it how much to pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's shooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They told me that the technology shoots a
beam out approximately three feet every 30
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds and measures the amount of CO2
present at that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three feet from the monitor every 30
seconds and adjust it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also hang a few other monitors
throughout the facility at strategic
[SPEAKER_00]: places and it monitors there and the fans
are supposed to activate and move it
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have everything dialed in,
it's always hard to get all of the parts
[SPEAKER_00]: moving all together at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, honestly, there's always one or
two things that need to be dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a giant commercial grow, we'll get
them dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then once you get that dialed in,
something else is going to break too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get to work on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of fun, but we use a lot of CO2
and that is the short version.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know all the technical part.
[SPEAKER_00]: We run the lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We run the controller and then sometimes
the lines freeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as long as you got good customer
service, the CO2 works wonderfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only breaks down a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time it's right after a
refill.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fucking lines will freeze and then
they don't stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all your CO2 is just pumping
through the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is a great advantage to commercial
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see tremendous robust growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can run a little bit higher of a
temperature in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the summer, if you're struggling for
a couple of extra degrees, pump up that
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll cover you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I really think it's helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want your name said,
but you know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are welcome for the great advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you have a successful adventure in
the cannabis industry if you do choose to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide us with CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very necessary supplement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to get into it,
please get into it and be reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we need in this industry as
reliable businesses.
