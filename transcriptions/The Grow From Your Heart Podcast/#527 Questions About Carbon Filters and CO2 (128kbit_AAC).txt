I like to start this podcast off by
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about what I'm smoking today I've
been taking dabs of cowboy kush full
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum extract from green dot labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of ha og and stardog On
the package the flavor is described as
[SPEAKER_00]: earthy fuel and leather on the back The
potency label says the product does
[SPEAKER_00]: contain sixty four point eight eight
percent THC I am thoroughly satisfied and
[SPEAKER_00]: impressed with the cowboy kush full
spectrum extract This was a four gram jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say four gram jar because now it is a
zero gram jar It started off with big
[SPEAKER_00]: chunky diamonds just the right amount of
terp sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a beautiful presentation the
flavor and aroma were perfect And the buzz
[SPEAKER_00]: was delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm sitting back in the chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of mellow I'd like to go grab
some snacks, but that would be a
[SPEAKER_00]: never-ending process right now So big
shout out to our friends at green dot labs

spectrum extract Ladies and gentlemen in

[SPEAKER_00]: We had a great chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a good hangout Big thanks to
everybody who listened to that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a good time doing two guys coughing

[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable I do intend to zoo to do zoom
videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for the stuttering today We're
gonna blame that on the cowboy Kush full
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum extract It's got me my tongue got
caught on my teeth and I could not see
[SPEAKER_00]: what I was saying All right, ladies and
gentlemen, this is going to be a fun
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in a good mood I'm nice and stoned
about a good day It's nice weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's finally not cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 60 something degrees today where I
live That may not be warm where you live
[SPEAKER_00]: quit showing off, California where I live.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was super nice It's gonna start
getting super nice really soon and pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say they are going to lift the
quarantine restrictions I'm excited for
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly don't know how excited I am to
get back in public I don't know it's mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: emotions, but just to know I'm allowed to
go back outside and things may get normal
[SPEAKER_00]: again Has me feeling excited once I get
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see how my OCD and my journey
Termophobia really does with being out
[SPEAKER_00]: there in public again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna try not to talk too much about
quarantine and kovat We're just gonna make
[SPEAKER_00]: a timestamp on this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am recording this on Friday,
April 24th.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are currently like several days into a
quarantine kovat situation So if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to this in the future,
this was actually recorded during the
[SPEAKER_00]: kovat lockdown It's fucking weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just as weird as everybody said but
nothing too crazy has happened where I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your timestamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your historical moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on Move forward the first email
on today's episode comes from a longtime
[SPEAKER_00]: listener I'm not sure if they want their
name said but the email honestly I printed
[SPEAKER_00]: the email out and this was the last print
from that ink cartridge So there are a few
[SPEAKER_00]: words missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email is a little fuzzy on the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can make out what it says It goes
something a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says hey Rasta Jeff I never miss an
episode of the grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast and I usually catch the live feed
every Monday night Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me every Monday night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a lot of live Instagram feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go live 710 mountain time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually hang out for about an hour I
talk about cannabis and I answer random
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join me if you're available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm irey underscore genetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the live feed This listener goes
on to say I am a caregiver in Michigan and
[SPEAKER_00]: you have taught then the next sentence
gets cut out I'm gonna hope it says I have
[SPEAKER_00]: taught you a lot I'm gonna hope it doesn't
say that I've taught you anything terrible
[SPEAKER_00]: and taught you bad habits But it does go
on to say I have two quick questions on
[SPEAKER_00]: episode 523 you mentioned Rosen wasn't
your concentrate of choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an old-school flower smoker But
literally then a lot of it gets cut out a
[SPEAKER_00]: full line then I can read Concentrate
because the majority were being made using
[SPEAKER_00]: solvents, but it's hard to read that but
the next sentence says solvent-free I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought this was the best route to go I'm
new to all this and I thought I would
[SPEAKER_00]: really like to know the difference now I
did read this email before I printed it I
[SPEAKER_00]: think this listener does not have a lot of
experience with Concentrates and they are
[SPEAKER_00]: considering buying a rosin press because
that is a very affordable and efficient
[SPEAKER_00]: way to make concentrates at home It is
also very safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were considering purchasing a
rosin press is what I do believe if I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: correct So they're asking why I have said
that rosin is not my favorite concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Do not prefer rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like bh o concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Full-spectrum extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like batters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are what I prefer that is not made
With rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the rosin tastes a little bit
funky to me It always has a hint of a
[SPEAKER_00]: burnt popsicle sort of a flavor I do have
one friend who makes quality rosin,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is quite an extensive process He
makes bubble hash out of fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may be inaccurate on some of these
statements some of these details I believe
[SPEAKER_00]: he is fresh freezing concentrate making
bubble hash out of that then fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: freezing or freeze drying the concentrate
then he is making pressed rosin from That
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate so there are a lot more steps
when you remove the Vegetative part the
[SPEAKER_00]: flour part from the press it makes things
taste take makes things taste much better
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, that was hard for my face to say
the process of squishing raw flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes the final product taste much
better I don't think you get as much of
[SPEAKER_00]: that burnt popcorn flavor If you actually
press bubble hash if you make hash out of
[SPEAKER_00]: it, then press the bubble hash It's a full
another step.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a whole another process.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot more work, but it really
Drastically improves the quality of the
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to make rosin,
I recommend you follow Pedro's grow room
[SPEAKER_00]: on Instagram and on YouTube He teaches a
lot of great techniques on making high
[SPEAKER_00]: quality rosin It is not my favorite unless
Pedro makes it I would not buy rosin from
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody but Pedro Hypothetically if he
were to make some available So I am NOT a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge fan of rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my personal preference There are
thousands of people out there who really
[SPEAKER_00]: love Rosin, it's just not for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to smoke BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like sauce and diamonds I really prefer
the batters lately something about a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: batter a green dot batter a good
apothecary batter Just a nice dollop in
[SPEAKER_00]: the middle of the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a nice texture to it a good
flavor and when you hit it There's
[SPEAKER_00]: something it does in the lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a nice expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get a big fat hit It tastes real
nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any hatred toward rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just not for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that What's a food that I don't
like?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even think of a food.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like because I'll eat freaking
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a vegetarian So we'll just say steak
isn't there's nothing wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not for me You guys that eat
steak do that rosin is steak is just not
[SPEAKER_00]: for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd prefer to have something different So
that's my comparison just personal
[SPEAKER_00]: preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it tastes good It hits hard
and it gets me high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not my favorite thing So that's
a long rant on that then there is a part
[SPEAKER_00]: two of this question It says another
grower podcast had a quick video a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of months ago about pHing and said you
always need to put your pH down or pH up
[SPEAKER_00]: in water to dilute that solution before
adding it to your nutrient reservoir
[SPEAKER_00]: because if you dump it straight in with
your nudes and then again the sentence
[SPEAKER_00]: gets cut out but I'm going to say there's
a risk of a chemical reaction or that acid
[SPEAKER_00]: or base in your pH balancing solution
could possibly disrupt the Nutrients that
[SPEAKER_00]: you just put into that mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand why they could say that that
is a very That's almost too much detail to
[SPEAKER_00]: worry about I don't think that's gonna be
a thing Most folks are going to be mixing
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a cap full of pH up or pH down into
their solution You've got a five gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're putting very little pH up pH down
in there I don't think it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: enough Chemical to cause any problem at
that rate the nutrients you've already
[SPEAKER_00]: added to that water are chelated and
buffered They're protected basically from
[SPEAKER_00]: that other chemical reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're putting in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a chemist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a scientist But I don't think that
those products are powerful enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: cause any damage in small dilutions now in
a commercial environment we're putting a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred milliliters 250 mils of pH down in
a solution at a time that may need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: diluted that could be a good idea to
dilute that with a cup of water then pour
[SPEAKER_00]: that in when you're going with larger
batches that may really be helpful but for
[SPEAKER_00]: the basic home grower and a small batch of
nutrients with a small mix I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: it would be necessary but if you've got
crazy OCD and you want to be extra
[SPEAKER_00]: detailed that could be a thing that you
could do it could not hurt but I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: find it to be absolutely necessary for the
small grow environment keep in mind I did
[SPEAKER_00]: preface that by saying zero chemistry
experience I have zero chemistry knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any papers that say I'm good
at chemistry so I'm not really qualified
[SPEAKER_00]: to give that answer I'm just telling you
that I've never seen a problem in the
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands if not millions of fucking
batches of nutrients I've mixed so I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to thank you for sending a great email I
think we've been chatting a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: corresponding through email I think I've
answered a couple of your questions you
[SPEAKER_00]: may have actually supported me a little
bit so I thank you for all of the love and
[SPEAKER_00]: support I do know your name I don't know
if you want it said on the show but thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you I do appreciate the great message if
you have more questions please send them
[SPEAKER_00]: my way I will get them on the show if I
don't get them on the show I will answer
[SPEAKER_00]: privately thank you for the support if
anybody else out there has a question my
[SPEAKER_00]: email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com I would
[SPEAKER_00]: love to get your listener generated
cannabis cultivation or cannabis culture
[SPEAKER_00]: question here on the show you guys that
cowboy Kush has got me fucked up I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: talkative today let's keep flowing we have
got a couple of great questions which one
[SPEAKER_00]: are we gonna do first they're both right
here in front of me this one is gonna work
[SPEAKER_00]: well it says Rasta Jeff I appreciate all
of your knowledge on the podcast I have a
[SPEAKER_00]: quick question about carbon filters very
good question you guys how often do you
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend changing the whole filter I have
changed out the dust filter but I have
[SPEAKER_00]: noticed a little PM and the humidity is
starting to rise a bit I've been using it
[SPEAKER_00]: for a year they have to be replaced or
just the outer dust filter the smell has
[SPEAKER_00]: been in check but I'm a little bit
concerned with the PM I just added a fan
[SPEAKER_00]: in the corner and ordered a new clip on
oscillating fan prior to that I only had
[SPEAKER_00]: one small clip on fan maybe I just need
more airflow I'm in a four by four and the
[SPEAKER_00]: relative excuse me the relative humidity
has been 50 to 60 percent you're a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit high there we need to lower that
humidity the temps are around 72 with
[SPEAKER_00]: lights on 60 with the lights off I'm
running to Mars TS 1000 LEDs thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff from AJ all right there are a few
things we need to address here in this
[SPEAKER_00]: question yes you do need to replace that
carbon filter I think the manufacturer
[SPEAKER_00]: recommends every two years I don't know
how much air you're running through there
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what size blower you
purchased I don't know what size carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: filter you've got I don't know how big the
room is I don't know other environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: factors to put into my brain equation here
I don't know how much stank and dust and
[SPEAKER_00]: dirt and pollen and powdery mildew and
humidity have gone through that filter
[SPEAKER_00]: most manufacturers say 18 to 28 I think
it's 26 what's the fucking 18 to 30 months
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to do math in my head they say
one and a half to two and a half years
[SPEAKER_00]: they recommend about a two-year change
you're saying that so it is time to change
[SPEAKER_00]: it probably because you've got a lot of
other factors you've had powdery mildew in
[SPEAKER_00]: there the humidity is raising the humidity
will lessen the effectiveness and lifelong
[SPEAKER_00]: the longevity of your filter you've also
had powdery mildew I would consider
[SPEAKER_00]: swapping out that filter just because of
the powdery mildew I know it's going into
[SPEAKER_00]: there and then going out but I don't know
powdery mildew that makes me paranoid I
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't want to get that again so it is
probably time or close to time to changing
[SPEAKER_00]: out that filter if it's in the budget it
is something I would consider now you said
[SPEAKER_00]: that you had powdery mildew also you asked
about the the outer filter if that thing
[SPEAKER_00]: is dirty give it one clean with oxy clean
rinse it out one time put it back the next
[SPEAKER_00]: time it gets dirty that is generally when
I say that it's time to replace the filter
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's getting that much dust in it it's
showing you that it's getting really dirty
[SPEAKER_00]: on the inside it's probably gonna stop
taking out the smell real well you say it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't stink that's your grow you also
don't think your armpits stink when your
[SPEAKER_00]: girlfriend leans on you and goes God you
need a fucking shower we don't notice some
[SPEAKER_00]: smells we get nose-blind to certain things
bring somebody new into the house and see
[SPEAKER_00]: if they notice that grow that's how you
know if the filter works bring the
[SPEAKER_00]: landlord over see if they notice that's
how you know if the carbon filter works
[SPEAKER_00]: now we're talking we've talked about
changing out the filter that dust cover
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to be clean needs to be replaced
needs to be put back on run it again check
[SPEAKER_00]: for smell if you're confident that there's
no smell you may be okay I'm concerned
[SPEAKER_00]: with the powdery mildew in there that may
be all right I don't think you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: blow it back out it just makes me worried
keep things clean it shouldn't smell if
[SPEAKER_00]: you smell it swap it out now what has me
concerned you said that the humidity is
[SPEAKER_00]: high and what you have done to fix the
powdery mildew is to add a fan a fan is a
[SPEAKER_00]: good start but that is not going to lower
the humidity we need a way to remove the
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity from the room and that can be
done through an exhaust fan by sucking the
[SPEAKER_00]: air up through the top of the tent or that
can be done by placing a dehumidifier in
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual tent but I don't think that a
fan is going to solve the powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: problem it will slow it down it will make
it longer it will make it take longer to
[SPEAKER_00]: appear but I don't think it's going to be
the solution so find a way to lower that
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity 50 to 60 percent when you get
into flowers is going to be ridiculous and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're also going to have more vegetation
in the room at that time you'll have big
[SPEAKER_00]: buds you'll have more leaves you'll be
watering more frequently you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have more opportunity and more reason for
powdery mildew to pop up I recommend some
[SPEAKER_00]: way to get that humidity out of there I
also recommend maybe a harder defoliation
[SPEAKER_00]: and that should do it for you defoliate
take some leaves out of there and then
[SPEAKER_00]: just learn how to lessen the humidity
overall in the room exhaust at the top
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidifier something like that is going
to be required so you do need to replace
[SPEAKER_00]: that filter I would say about a year 18
months in I don't go over two years of
[SPEAKER_00]: course I grow super stinky weed I've got
just the right size filter the appropriate
[SPEAKER_00]: size blower so that it lasts about 18 18
months two years you're going to want to
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce your humidity or that powdery
mildew will keep coming back it sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: like we got you figured out bro you've got
that clip-on fan and another fan it may be
[SPEAKER_00]: time to add an exhaust fan to the top of
the grow tent I want to thank my friend AJ
[SPEAKER_00]: for the great grow question you guys I'm
going to take a quick drink of some water
[SPEAKER_00]: here I'm not going to press pause please
bear with me you folks on the video if the
[SPEAKER_00]: video ever comes out you get to watch me
take a sip so here we go take an equip sit
[SPEAKER_00]: quick sip join me hydrate motherfuckers
[SPEAKER_00]: well I needed that more than I realized
that was pretty damn refreshing drink some
[SPEAKER_00]: water you guys all right I've got another
message here in front of me let me get my

[SPEAKER_00]: land imagine some beautiful lemon Jeffrey
plants they're fucking perfect now we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: keep going it says I'm absolutely loving
the podcast I think you're doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: fantastic job educating your listeners and
helping us focus on things to help us all
[SPEAKER_00]: become better growers during these
difficult times that's awesome dude thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you now it says first question is about
co2 during the vegetative state is there
[SPEAKER_00]: any benefit to running co2 during veg yes
running co2 during veg will make your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants grow more quickly you'll get more
rapid growth you'll get better use of your
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients you're feeding the plants high
quality nutrients hopefully we've got them
[SPEAKER_00]: under high quality lighting if you can
afford it and the room is designed
[SPEAKER_00]: properly yes co2 will absolutely increase
the performance of your plants right now
[SPEAKER_00]: general atmospheric conditions are
approximately 400 ppms of co2 particles
[SPEAKER_00]: per million of co2 depending on where you
are that could be more or less about 50
[SPEAKER_00]: ppms more 50 ppms less based on your
location your altitude will have something
[SPEAKER_00]: to do with that but generally we're
sitting about 400 particles per million of
[SPEAKER_00]: co2 in the general atmosphere our plants
can eat much greater volumes of co2 than
[SPEAKER_00]: that they'll get a much higher performance
environment going on you'll see it if you
[SPEAKER_00]: do it they'll notice so I'm gonna keep
going because I'm rambling I want to get
[SPEAKER_00]: myself back on track it says my second
question is how much and for how long do I
[SPEAKER_00]: run co2 this is my first attempt at
running co2 I've started on day one of
[SPEAKER_00]: flower okay I would have done it in veg
but you started in flower you're putting
[SPEAKER_00]: them into turbocharged that's cool it says
my setup consists of a five by four tent
[SPEAKER_00]: with a high output forevergreen indoor
uniformity pro led I'm not familiar with
[SPEAKER_00]: that light sounds fancy if it's working
for you that's awesome I know what's nice
[SPEAKER_00]: tent that is it says I'm running two
five-gallon rain science air pots with pro
[SPEAKER_00]: mix and nectar of the gods this is all
making sense so far I've got an autopilot
[SPEAKER_00]: co2 meter and controller I said it 1200
ppm that is gonna work well for you that
[SPEAKER_00]: will work my tent runs around 80 to 85
degrees with RH around 60 you might want
[SPEAKER_00]: to reduce that RH just a little bit during
lights on AC infinity fans handle the
[SPEAKER_00]: exhaust I have two oscillating fans and
two stationary fans in the tent should I
[SPEAKER_00]: run the co2 until harvest or is this a
waste and is 1200 too much too little or
[SPEAKER_00]: just right all right there are a couple of
things to talk about in that you were
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it correctly I would reduce the
overall humidity and I think if you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: the LEDs 80 to 85 may be cool the
oscillating fans and stationary fans are
[SPEAKER_00]: cool should I run it till harvest yes I
would run it right up until the day of
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest you are not wasting it at that
point 1200 is good 14 is good 16 is when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're kind of pushing it 1600 ppms is
that's when you're kind of maybe wasting
[SPEAKER_00]: it 14 you're like oh yeah 1200 is great um
there's something that got my attention
[SPEAKER_00]: though where is it there's a line an
exhaust fan let me read back my tent oh AC
[SPEAKER_00]: infinity fans handle the exhaust my
question is are you exhausting out your
[SPEAKER_00]: co2 are you wasting your co2 with that
exhaust process you've got a very small
[SPEAKER_00]: environment it's not going to take a lot
of air movement to exhaust out all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: co2 you were generating so is the co2 in
the tent are you exhausting that tent into
[SPEAKER_00]: a room how big is that room how much co2
is happening in that room are we able to
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle that co2 back into the tent if you
have got co2 happening and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: minimize the humidity I may reduce the
exhaust fans and not run them or run them
[SPEAKER_00]: very minimally because you don't want to
keep sucking out that co2 it's expensive
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't want to keep going and buying
tanks or whatever you're doing to generate
[SPEAKER_00]: the co2 I would think of cost-effective
ways to set this up I don't know what your
[SPEAKER_00]: full environment is I don't know where the
tent is located but are you wasting co2 by
[SPEAKER_00]: pumping it right out of the tent every
time your exhaust fan comes on hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going into a bedroom an office the
spare room whatever and hopefully it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just drawing that right back in maybe it
mixes with the atmosphere in the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: the room and it can come back in you get a
little fresh air with it I'm not sure but
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're pumping co2 you can turn off the
exhaust fans as long as the heat and
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity don't get too high so that's a
juggle a balancing act you're gonna have
[SPEAKER_00]: to dial in there but it sounds like you're
doing things correctly you've got the
[SPEAKER_00]: meter the controller it sounds like you're
doing it right now as long as the co2 goes
[SPEAKER_00]: off when the lights go off I think
everything will be cool but my advice is
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure you are running that
correctly that you're not sucking it all
[SPEAKER_00]: out with your exhaust because that will
get very expensive it says feel free to
[SPEAKER_00]: share my pictures if you choose to use the
question on the show and also feel free to
[SPEAKER_00]: use my name all right big shout out to my
friend sour D bro you're killing it with
[SPEAKER_00]: that lemon Jeffrey I hope I answered your
co2 question 1200 is good 14 is high 16 is
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking really high 18 is when people go
what are you doing bro so you're right in
[SPEAKER_00]: the right ballpark you were doing it
correctly do it while the lights are on
[SPEAKER_00]: turn the co2 off when the lights go off
and I do recommend using it at the
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative stage I generally start co2
kind of low six or eight hundred ppm in
[SPEAKER_00]: veg and then about every week I increase a
little bit until we're into that beefy
[SPEAKER_00]: bloom stage and then you'll notice the
performance increase and take notes write
[SPEAKER_00]: down how much you're paying for the co2
and how often you buy it and then see how
[SPEAKER_00]: much performance increase you get at the
end you get a better harvest you get more
[SPEAKER_00]: yield was it worth it do it two or three
times and find out if it's worth that
[SPEAKER_00]: extra trip to the store the extra
equipment the extra effort see the extra
[SPEAKER_00]: money see if it's actually worth it all
right sour D I want to thank you for a
[SPEAKER_00]: great message if you've got any more
questions please send me another email all
