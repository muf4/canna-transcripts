[SPEAKER_00]: from your heart all of the information you
need will be right there on the screen and
[SPEAKER_00]: of course I did include a link in the show
notes and in the video description to make
[SPEAKER_00]: it super easy for all of my friends once
again you guys really thank you for all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the patreon support I also want to thank
everybody who supported my friend crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: hand grows on the last episode I asked you
guys to go follow and visit my friend
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy hand grows on YouTube crazy hand
sent me a great message saying how excited
[SPEAKER_00]: he was about his new followers so I want
to send a thank you from crazy and myself
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you guys for supporting other
members of the community in this episode
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to ask you to follow another
friend of mine I highly recommend you
[SPEAKER_00]: check out reclining with Riven Riven
waters has a new channel he is newly
[SPEAKER_00]: disabled he's adjusting to his new life
and it is very interesting and
[SPEAKER_00]: entertaining to watch so I invite you guys
to check out Riven reclining with Riven on
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube give him a follow support a few
more members of the community all right
[SPEAKER_00]: what else are we going to talk about I got
a lot of comments and messages lately
[SPEAKER_00]: about how many times am I going to adjust
this microphone during the podcast the
[SPEAKER_00]: answer is as many as I need to I've got
notes on a computer I've got notes on
[SPEAKER_00]: paper I've got headphones on I can hear
exactly what's going on in the show I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: doing microphone adjustments based on
where I'm looking I'm getting the mic out
[SPEAKER_00]: of my field of view but as I change my
position of my face I want to move the mic
[SPEAKER_00]: as close to my mouth as I can to keep it
sounding good trying to be a professional
[SPEAKER_00]: broadcaster that's why I got the fancy mic
arm so I can keep this bad dog right on my
[SPEAKER_00]: face so how many times am I gonna move
this mic as many as I fucking need to I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna make the show sound good if it
drives you crazy I do apologize but I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to keep it when I read the computer
I need it kind of here when I read the
[SPEAKER_00]: paper I gotta move it lower to get it out
of the out of the view of the paper so
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what's happening I'm not completely
crazy just a little bit like I said in a
[SPEAKER_00]: previous episode my mother had me tested
we know I'm not crazy anyway that's why
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm adjusting the mic so erratically there
is a method to my mic adjusting madness
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry if it drives you crazy trying to get
it out of my field of view also try to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep myself I can hear exactly how much of
me is coming through these headphones I
[SPEAKER_00]: notice when I talk right here it sounds
real good you get it about here I kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: fade off a little bit so that's why I'm
playing with the mic so much you can tell
[SPEAKER_00]: the mic arm needs a little need some
Viagra or some tightening it's getting a
[SPEAKER_00]: little droopy today this show is not
brought to you by by Bluetooth so we won't
[SPEAKER_00]: go there let me get myself back on track
what are we gonna do with this part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: show this is where we are going to work
into the emails and patreon messages part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the show the first question on today's
episode came from the grow help tab on the
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics website that's right if
you go to my website I read genetics comm
[SPEAKER_00]: you will find a grow help tab on that tab
if you click there you will be asked I
[SPEAKER_00]: think we determined there are 16
preliminary questions we ask your name
[SPEAKER_00]: what name to use on the podcast if I give
you a shout out we ask what strain you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing then we ask a few details about
the grow then we allow you to ask a
[SPEAKER_00]: question about your grow so this first
question came from the grow help tab on I
[SPEAKER_00]: read genetics comm and it goes a lot like
this this one they want the name on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast to be they want to be called
Jonathan they are growing Leonardo the
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry cookies s1 from I read genetics
they're growing indoors under a high
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure sodium bulb they are in flower
they're in week three of flower they're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in cocoa they're using here's the
list of nutrients in their last feed
[SPEAKER_00]: they're using GH flora series they used
armor side CalMac micro grow bloom cool
[SPEAKER_00]: bloom for a licious plus diamond next to
diamond nectar and black strap molasses
[SPEAKER_00]: that is a lot of nutrients that's a lot of
nutrients in one feed it says the pH of
[SPEAKER_00]: the last feeding was six point oh I would
bring that up to at least six to maybe six
[SPEAKER_00]: for some more in that range would be
better for your plants to absorb and
[SPEAKER_00]: uptake some of those nutrients the PPM or
the EC of the last feeding was 600 that's
[SPEAKER_00]: with all those nutrients in there that may
be acceptable there was a lot of shit in
[SPEAKER_00]: there though but you didn't use a lot of
it it looks like the daytime temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: is 75 to 78 which is acceptable nighttime
temps 70 to 72 here is where we get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: question or problem part of this message
it says hey Rasta Jeff I just want to
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you again for all that you do for
the community and myself you are very
[SPEAKER_00]: welcome thank you for thanking me that is
like recharge you're giving me a little
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients here to keep me going so thank
you for that it says a lot of great shit
[SPEAKER_00]: it goes on to say I'm now growing your
Leonardo to hopefully get some more color
[SPEAKER_00]: in the garden I'm in week three of flower
and the tips of my leaves are slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: discolored and burnt I feed with every
watering I feed one gallon at 600 PPMs
[SPEAKER_00]: every other day with 25% runoff so I was
wondering if I should do one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: three options so the problem is that the
leaf tips are getting a little bit burnt I
[SPEAKER_00]: call that getting your nails done if you
picture the leave is a giant hand the
[SPEAKER_00]: fingernail tips they're getting a little
bit done they're just starting to get
[SPEAKER_00]: their nails painted that is a sign that
you may be feeding just a little bit too
[SPEAKER_00]: much or is that the sign that you're
pushing them just enough that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: decision you need to make does it look
problematic or is it like like if you look
[SPEAKER_00]: at an athlete and they're like sweating
and they look like they need a fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: break do your plants look like they're
getting worked out and they're right at
[SPEAKER_00]: the point of like oh feel the burn or are
they like oh shit feel the burn which one
[SPEAKER_00]: is it that's the decision you need to make
there so they're getting their nails done
[SPEAKER_00]: one thing I did notice is that that's a
lot of nutrients and you are feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in week three of flower and you're
feeding the grow and bloom I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: enough about the GH flora series to know
if the grow and bloom are both required
[SPEAKER_00]: but I wouldn't assume with most lines that
by week three they would ask you to use
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow bottle and the bloom bottle you
may be doubling up on some things you may
[SPEAKER_00]: be getting more nitrogen than necessary
but big disclaimer I don't know this
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient line I don't know their nutrient
calculator so if it's says to use the girl
[SPEAKER_00]: along with the bloom do that but by now in
most lines I would have abandoned that
[SPEAKER_00]: grow nutrient we don't need this much
nitrogen you may be doubling up on
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus and potassium and getting a
whole lot of nitrogen which you don't need
[SPEAKER_00]: so that may be one thing you could adjust
just from reading your list of nutrients I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know that I would feed them that
many things all at once if you're feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple times a week I would go with your
base nutrients your cal mag maybe the
[SPEAKER_00]: armor sigh every time and then I would
switch up like the cool bloom and the
[SPEAKER_00]: floor alicia's I would do those on
different days but that that's what I
[SPEAKER_00]: would do if it's working for you bro you
keep doing your thing I'm just saying
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a lot of shit to feed it all at one
time even though your PPMs are only 600 it
[SPEAKER_00]: still seems like a lot of things to go in
there in one day I'm gonna get on to the
[SPEAKER_00]: three options which you have presented
which you think may help cure your nails
[SPEAKER_00]: from getting too burnt it says I was
wondering if I should do one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: three options should I keep feeding as
I've been doing if the plants don't look
[SPEAKER_00]: like they are super distressed if they're
just getting their nails done you're
[SPEAKER_00]: pushing them right to the limit you're
gonna get a huge fat harvest super fat
[SPEAKER_00]: chunky buds don't push them too hard keep
doing what you're doing and as long as you
[SPEAKER_00]: flush properly and cure and dry them
properly they should taste good at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: the other option is feed with half
strength PPMs once or twice to do a light
[SPEAKER_00]: flush of the cocoa urine cocoa so just one
quick flush would be enough and I would
[SPEAKER_00]: probably do I wouldn't even do half
strength PPMs that's not even a flush
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just a week feed I would just do
water one time until you get like 20 to
[SPEAKER_00]: that 20% runoff is fair which I don't know
that that's necessary unless they're
[SPEAKER_00]: really getting cooked then it says feed
only once or twice feed only water once or
[SPEAKER_00]: twice to flush the cocoa yeah if you're
gonna do a flush don't put any nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: in there that's just I don't know it's
what's the word there counterproductive
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to flush and you're giving
it nutrients at the same time so that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not gonna help you I would go with either
option number one or option number two
[SPEAKER_00]: keep feeding as you have been maybe no
excuse me for that I'm not even gonna edit
[SPEAKER_00]: that maybe spread out the feedings give
like I said give one bottle on one day and
[SPEAKER_00]: the other bottle the next day but with
your PPMs being at 600 or your EC PPMs EC
[SPEAKER_00]: being at 600 I think you're gonna be okay
with what you're doing so just pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to those leaves maybe reduce the
feeding just a little bit maybe separate
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the bottles on different days but
as long as the plants aren't looking
[SPEAKER_00]: pissed off keep doing what you're doing if
they do get too pissed off reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding a little bit if they stop eating
if they look like they've stalled out on
[SPEAKER_00]: you that's when I would give them one
flush and I would use I think the armor
[SPEAKER_00]: don't use the armor sigh I don't see an
enzyme product in here I would flush one
[SPEAKER_00]: time with an enzymatic product and then I
would continue to feed instead of 600 PPMs
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe hit 500 and see how they respond to
that but I think your plants are gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: okay unless this burn is getting really
really ridiculous I would continue to do
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're doing said also if you can
bring Sean or one of the organic guys back
[SPEAKER_00]: on the show again from the beginning we
would love we would be awesome we would
[SPEAKER_00]: love to eventually give organic growing a
try I would love to get some of the more
[SPEAKER_00]: organic guys on the show also make sure
you check out embracing organics if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not already watching the embracing
organics podcast we they talk a lot about
[SPEAKER_00]: organic growing embracing organics is a
cannabis growing podcast it is live on
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube it is 7 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: mountain time on Thursday that's when we
go live however the show is left up it
[SPEAKER_00]: goes up to YouTube and stays up forever so
you can go to YouTube right now and search
[SPEAKER_00]: for embracing organics I am NOT the host
of the show I'm a guest a panel member on
[SPEAKER_00]: the show we bring on a lot of other people
we talk about organic growing we talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about all types of growing but you can
learn a lot about organics on the
[SPEAKER_00]: embracing organics podcast and once we get
some things settled in with the pandemic
[SPEAKER_00]: and all this stuff I do plan on adding
another microphone to the table and we
[SPEAKER_00]: will get some folks to come talk about
organics we may just have to get some
[SPEAKER_00]: people to zoom in if you're an organic
growing expert and you'd like to be on a
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast send me an email email address is
bro from your heart at hotmail.com all
[SPEAKER_00]: right we're gonna keep moving hey bro
thank you for the great message and let me
[SPEAKER_00]: know how this goes give me an update in a
week or so and let me know what your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants look like let me know what you
chose to do maybe include a picture send
[SPEAKER_00]: me an email with a photo of these plants
and we can make better decisions on what
[SPEAKER_00]: to do I'm sure you saw the last episode I
actually dropped a photo in to show you
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant I was talking about I'm trying
to improve the show and that is a great
[SPEAKER_00]: way to do it so send me some pics I'll put
them in the podcast where do we go from
[SPEAKER_00]: there I've got another great message this
one says yo Rasta Jeff I'm really enjoying
[SPEAKER_00]: the show even more so since you switched
to being on camera instead of just having
[SPEAKER_00]: a static screen podcast format thank you
we've gone through a couple of different
[SPEAKER_00]: iterations of the video show now we had
the flag behind us and the old crusty
[SPEAKER_00]: white wall then we moved to the office
where we have the sneakers behind us now
[SPEAKER_00]: we got a new painted set with a fresh new
backdrop and some brand new lighting so
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you for noticing that I'm making
some improvement putting some effort into
[SPEAKER_00]: the show spending that patreon money here
on the podcast thank you for noticing that
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm glad it keeps your attention a
little bit better it says I have a
[SPEAKER_00]: question about selfing and of course
selfing is when we take a plant and we cut
[SPEAKER_00]: a clone of that same plant we reverse one
with a silver thiosulfate solution that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant will then create female pollen you
put that female pollen on a clone of the
[SPEAKER_00]: same plant to make seeds that are s ones
that is selfing we're gonna talk more
[SPEAKER_00]: about that in the message but it says I
have a question about selfing if you take
[SPEAKER_00]: a male and a female of the same strain and
you make seeds you get an f2 with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: variation right that is accurate a male
and a female of the same strain you make
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds you get an f2 with a lot of
variation that is accurate whereas F or as
[SPEAKER_00]: s1 seeds this is where we're gonna have
some some different conversation whereas
[SPEAKER_00]: with s1 seeds should show a lot less
variation because all of the genes are
[SPEAKER_00]: from the same plant what if you grew out
two females of the same strain from seed
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse one and breed them will you get
the same type of variation as an f2 and
[SPEAKER_00]: would it be called an s2 or would you just
call them feminized f2s thanks for all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the knowledge thank you from spanky nuts
for 20 this is a great question there are
[SPEAKER_00]: some things to uh to think about here so
let's kind of outline what he's trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: do here what our listener is trying to ask
about they want to grow a pack of seeds in
[SPEAKER_00]: that pack of seeds there are going to be
multiple phenotypes they want to find a
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype number one that's a female and
phenotype number two that's a female
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got two different phenotypes so
that's a good start for this what if we
[SPEAKER_00]: took two females of the same strain
reverse one of them and then put the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen on the other one um that is sort of
an s2 now i'm going to call that an r1 um
[SPEAKER_00]: that might be like an r1 inbred line i'm
going to call i don't know what the
[SPEAKER_00]: official name for that is because we don't
do that nobody really does that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff i've done something like that and
never knew what to call it uh it's not a
[SPEAKER_00]: self because in my in my vocabulary the
way that i see the word self is it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: to be on the same plant it's got to be a
clone of the same thing so this is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be an r1 but it's going to be i'm just
going to pick a strain i'm going to call
[SPEAKER_00]: it spanky's nuts 420 og that's the strain
we're working with this is going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: spanky's nuts 420 og r1 it's a reversal
because we used technically two different
[SPEAKER_00]: plants they may be the same uh the same
strain the same genetics the same all that
[SPEAKER_00]: but they are different phenotypes so we're
going to see uh different representations
[SPEAKER_00]: in the progeny you're going to see a
little bit of this phenotype and a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of this phenotype even though they're
the same strain they are different plants
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like uh it's like taking two
different plants they have the same
[SPEAKER_00]: parents so you're not going to see as much
weird grandparent expression you may see
[SPEAKER_00]: some crazy crazy uh recessive great
grandparent genes expressed in that but um
[SPEAKER_00]: i don't think we would call that an s2 i
think that would be an r1 or some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: an r1 end bread project is what that would
be i would just call it an r1 and explain
[SPEAKER_00]: to people i wouldn't label it like uh
spanky's nuts 420 number one cross to
[SPEAKER_00]: spanky's nuts 420 number two uh and then
just label it as an r1 because that is a
[SPEAKER_00]: reversal i think that's the way we would
do that let me make sure i covered this
[SPEAKER_00]: question let's see that's ones would show
a lot less variation what if you grow out
[SPEAKER_00]: two females of the same strain reverse one
or breed them will you get the same type
[SPEAKER_00]: of variation all right so um i think not
as much variation as the f2 because there
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't as many options um with the f2 you
know what the mom and the dad are gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: look like you're gonna see mom and dad
options and the grandparents definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: give you more options we don't have uh
basically different grandparents here so
[SPEAKER_00]: that recessive trait that pops up from the
grandparents it's going to be very uh very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar but you may see great grandparents
is what i think i was leading to earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: you may see weird great grandparents
traits come out of that that you have no
[SPEAKER_00]: idea what you're expecting there uh maybe
great great grandparents may be expressed
[SPEAKER_00]: in that when you go uh playing with
genetics like this this is when we open up
[SPEAKER_00]: weird stuff that's why the f2 shows a lot
of variation the f1 comes with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: vigor the f2 we really start opening up
variation uh f3 hopefully you've done
[SPEAKER_00]: selection to start narrowing back down
when we're working with fems we don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: as many uh many pieces to our puzzle as
many colors to our palette as many
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients to our recipe so you shouldn't
open as many things but uh that's when you
[SPEAKER_00]: start seeing background things pop up that
you never expected this is a fun project
[SPEAKER_00]: it's something that you should do if you
haven't already done this uh do it bro and
[SPEAKER_00]: tell me how this goes i would love to do
it for you but i honestly don't have time
[SPEAKER_00]: or space so i think you're gonna see
variation but it's going to be less
[SPEAKER_00]: variation and you may see great
grandparents at first i said grandparents
[SPEAKER_00]: but then i had to had to draw the family
tree in my head and talk it out you may
[SPEAKER_00]: see great grandparents uh come through in
some of the rare phenotypes but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: technically not an uh an r and s1 because
you're using different plants so that is a
[SPEAKER_00]: an r1 i hope i'm saying that correctly
it's an it's an r1 it's a reversal and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll see uh number one and number two in
there but it's gonna be you're gonna get a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of them that look 50 50 of number one
and number two a lot that look like number
[SPEAKER_00]: one a lot look like number two but then
you're gonna see some outliers that look
[SPEAKER_00]: like whatever that string was crossed with
you're gonna get some weirdness there then
[SPEAKER_00]: you may get some real mutants out of it
too because you're playing with feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics uh that's a really fun concept
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation that i would like to open up
um the question came from our friend
[SPEAKER_00]: sequoia organic farms it says hey
rostegyph i'm a new supporter from
[SPEAKER_00]: colorado check us out we are sequoia
organic farms they spell sequoia
[SPEAKER_00]: differently than you probably assume it's
s-e-q-u-o-y-a-h and then organic farms the
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional way it's all one word it goes
on to say i can't tell you enough how much
[SPEAKER_00]: your knowledge means to everyone thank you
bro i appreciate that it says thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: for all of the positive energy and keep
killing the game uh thank you bro just
[SPEAKER_00]: being me Trying to do what I do trying to
get these seeds and the message out to the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that need it Thank you for noticing
the hard work It says it's people like you
[SPEAKER_00]: who inspire people like me to tell you the
truth bro It's people like you who inspire
[SPEAKER_00]: people like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep it going We'll keep it going back
and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I do have a quick question for you
that I hope you can Talk about on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize if you've already covered
this in a previous episode That is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I already have with 600 episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realize people probably don't go back
and listen to all 600 If they've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: question, it's probably easier just to
redo it and since we're on this brand new
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome video format Why not have a new
episode on the old topics on the video
[SPEAKER_00]: format?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so if you already asked it or if
it's already been covered, that's okay I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna re-answer it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says can you dive into the specifics of
PPM TDS and EC?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they and what are their
relations?
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, there are multiple parts to this
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna answer all three I'll read
them quickly for you though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm an organic no-till living Soil
grower, I would love some tips on how to
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically water peat based super soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I seem to be an overwaterer My advice to
that you already know that you're an
[SPEAKER_00]: overwaterer Wait another day bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait until that plant looks like it's
thirsty It will let you know it will tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you then water it that's easy enough Then
it says any organic references to increase
[SPEAKER_00]: yields would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a whole whole organic episode I did
invite somebody to come on and do some
[SPEAKER_00]: organics and once again, I'll recommend
the embracing organic show Then I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: sure organic expert but for organic I
think I can recommend Budswell I think
[SPEAKER_00]: Budswell is an organic product and I think
that will help with your bloom booster
[SPEAKER_00]: situation Check out Budswell the liquid
make sure that's organic before you use
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not take my word for it I'm giving you
a disclaimer right now not a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: percent sure but that's what I would
recommend if it is organic do that now
[SPEAKER_00]: let's get into the part of the question
you actually wanted some help with that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm able to provide help for let's talk
about what our TDS PPMs and EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do all these letters mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: TDS is actually what we are measuring when
we measure PPM and EC TDS simply stands
[SPEAKER_00]: for total dissolved solids and there are a
couple of ways to measure the total
[SPEAKER_00]: dissolved solids in a solution So what
we're gonna do we're gonna have a solution
[SPEAKER_00]: up a container of water and nutrients That
is our solution in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to know how much Nutrient is in
our water the water if you've got RO water
[SPEAKER_00]: it should be zero PPMs zero EC so there
are zero total dissolved solids in there
[SPEAKER_00]: now We're gonna add our nutrients into it
and there are several reasons why it's
[SPEAKER_00]: good to know what your EC or your PPMs are
First of all if you're burning the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: like our one listener may be doing we can
see what the TDS is the PPMs and we can
[SPEAKER_00]: lower that or if we're getting a perfect
crop we can see that it was perfect we can
[SPEAKER_00]: write that down and we can repeat that or
if the plants need new new more nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: we can write down that 600 was a little
low and Let's give it 700 next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a good It's a good gauge a good
guide a good reference point and it can
[SPEAKER_00]: teach you a lot about your plants and what
they're uptaking So let's talk a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more specifically about what these
things are TDS is the total amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: dissolved solids in your bucket with your
water how many dissolved solids are in
[SPEAKER_00]: there the units of measure the common
units of measure of those total dissolved
[SPEAKER_00]: solids are PPMs and EC PPM stands for
particles per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got this many particles Of
nutrients per million particles of water
[SPEAKER_00]: in that solution TDS or no, I'm sorry EC
stands for electrical Conductivity,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's talk about electrical conductivity
Electrical conductivity is and I got this
[SPEAKER_00]: from the internet shout out to Google It
says electrical conductivity is the
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement of the ability of something to
conduct electricity I know that sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: very basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds kind of redundant Electrical
conductivity is the ability to conduct
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity the salts that we use for
Fertilizers do have the ability to conduct
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity All those salts you add in
there are conductive to electricity is
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm saying The EC measures how much
electricity they are able to conduct.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like you can plug in a light with
them That's very small amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: electrical conductivity, but that is what
the EC stands for PPM excuse me with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me fix my voice and try that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a 12 year old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise PPM meters particles per million
meters actually measure in EC and do a
[SPEAKER_00]: mathematical equation and convert that to
PPM So in my opinion EC is much more
[SPEAKER_00]: reliable than particles per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more used in science It's more used
in large-scale application.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll more likely see EC as a unit of
measurement over particles per million So
[SPEAKER_00]: also there are different conversion rates
Just like the imperial and metric system.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different conversions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in different regions different
countries different continents Particles
[SPEAKER_00]: per million will be converted differently
to EC in their conversion Calculator they
[SPEAKER_00]: use a different number to do the
conversion Unless you know where your
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient company is basing their
conversion on your PPM recommendations may
[SPEAKER_00]: be way off So particles per million are
telling us how much stuff is in that water
[SPEAKER_00]: Electrical conductivity is basically
telling us how much stuff is in that water
[SPEAKER_00]: But more specifically and that makes it
easier to remember to note How much
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient is in our solution?
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be mixing in five or six different
products into your solution You can always
[SPEAKER_00]: take your EC meter start off and see what
your starting water EC is if you're using
[SPEAKER_00]: RO It's gonna be zero if you're using tap
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have a few PPMs or a
little bit of EC in that water Now add
[SPEAKER_00]: your nitrogen or your base nutrient Stir
your EC meter around in there and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see what your particles per million or
your electrical conductivity level of your
[SPEAKER_00]: base nutrient is A lot of people like to
measure the EC and particles per million
[SPEAKER_00]: of their Cal Mag a lot of plants are very
critical on how much Cal Mag they use this
[SPEAKER_00]: is a really good way to dial in exactly
how much Cal Mag or calcium or magnesium
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever individual bottled nutrient
you've got you can definitely measure out
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly how much of that is going into
your solution by measuring your EC and
[SPEAKER_00]: your PPM while you are adding that product
to the reservoir You can actually have the
[SPEAKER_00]: meter in the reservoir pour it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what it is before you pour it and see
what it is After you pour it now,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I've got 600 PPMs of nitrogen
now You can pour in your Cal Mag if your
[SPEAKER_00]: goal is 200 particles per million of the
Cal Mag bottle pour that in until you see
[SPEAKER_00]: 800 PPMs of stuff or whatever number you
want on your EC screen You can do exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: how much of each nutrient bottle you want
at that rate So I highly recommend using
[SPEAKER_00]: EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I write down the EC of my solution before
it goes into the plants I write down the
[SPEAKER_00]: EC of my solution that runs out of my
plants I also write down the pH of that
[SPEAKER_00]: solution Before I feed it and what comes
out of the bottom of the plants I also
[SPEAKER_00]: write down every single nutrient that went
into that nutrient solution If I put 100
[SPEAKER_00]: mils of one thing 80 mils of another 20
mils of another and then a bunch of grams
[SPEAKER_00]: of recharge I write that all down on a
spreadsheet Then I write down my EC in my
[SPEAKER_00]: PPMs in my pH in and then I write down the
EC out and the pH out So I've got a good
[SPEAKER_00]: documentation of what happened Then if
something goes wrong, I can look back in
[SPEAKER_00]: my Feed chart I can look at the plants I
can look at my paperwork and that helps me
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of decide kind of determine kind of
decipher What may have gone wrong through
[SPEAKER_00]: a process of elimination?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we sprayed something that's written
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, maybe we defoliated too heavily
that's written down also But I take a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the EC as a reference guide I always
write down my EC of my solution in and out
[SPEAKER_00]: then we can use that data Like I said
earlier to either correct an issue or to
[SPEAKER_00]: repeat success if you've got a problem The
numbers will tell you maybe where your
[SPEAKER_00]: problem happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the pH coming out was a little
funky The EC coming out was a little
[SPEAKER_00]: funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was too high too low Maybe one of them
went one way one with the other that'll
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you what's happening with your runoff
the runoff reports are a whole other
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast I think I may have done that if
not, I need to do an updated version Even
[SPEAKER_00]: if I did I should probably do an updated
version But you can use that data to
[SPEAKER_00]: either correct or adjust or mimic your
previous results And when you're working
[SPEAKER_00]: with standard operating procedures in a
large-scale environment Repeatable results
[SPEAKER_00]: are what we're after if we nail this crop
We definitely want to nail that crop next
[SPEAKER_00]: time get a bonus reach potency goals reach
harvest weights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody gets a bonus Everybody's after a
bonus check all the patients get a better
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what happens when we take good
notes So it's my recommendation to stick
[SPEAKER_00]: with electrical conductivity as it is a
little bit more accurate When you're
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring each nutrient you can do your
PPMs that way if you want to it is easier
[SPEAKER_00]: to tell the numbers are more there you're
using like 600 700 800 when you're using
[SPEAKER_00]: the EC it's gonna be like point eight
point nine So it's easier to use the other
[SPEAKER_00]: scale as you're measuring each thing
individually overall go with the EC find
[SPEAKER_00]: your zone find what your plants love stick
with that and Repeat it.
