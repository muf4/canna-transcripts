[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, welcome to the show, ganja smokers
and ganja growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 442 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by my friends at Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds in your garden,
I highly recommend Seeds Here Now,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can find them at www.seedsherenow
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has come a bit of a tradition that we
start this podcast off by talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Stardog
Batter from Apothecary Farms, the label
[SPEAKER_00]: says this product contains 68.4% THC and
79.9% total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been scooping up big chunks of the
Stardog Batter, and then I am dunking that
[SPEAKER_00]: in the leftover Terps from a jar of GG4
Ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought a big jar of the GG4,
it had a lot of saucy Terps in the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: of it, so I am using the Stardog Batter as
a sponge to soak up the GG4 Terps,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these dabs are delicious and
tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always a fan of Stardog, I am always a
fan of the GG4 Ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you mix the two, it is really
delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to call this some Gorilla Dog or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to my friends at
Apothecary Farms for the delicious
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World, I am recording
on the 3rd of July.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to talk briefly about the 4th
of July.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to talk more about 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let's do a few shout
outs to some of our friends on Patreon.

[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World, I said we were
going to talk briefly about the 4th of
[SPEAKER_00]: July.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you hear a bunch of noise outside,
a bunch of explosions in the background of
[SPEAKER_00]: this recording, that is because I am
recording at the start of July.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where I live, we like to get started a
little bit early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody is blowing shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's had their fireworks going
since about the 1st of July in my
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun just went down about an hour ago,
so they are really getting going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to be a party in my
neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you hear some noise, please excuse
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just having a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everybody out there has a safe and
joyous 4th of July.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get yourselves blown up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get yourselves in any trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get a DUI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be safe out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do throw a barbecue,
don't forget about your vegetarian
[SPEAKER_00]: friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have something available for those folks
who don't want to eat a burger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make fun of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Invite us over.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to have a good time, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I've got for the 4th of July.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's segue into talking about 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: 710 is the next big holiday we are going
to celebrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is 710?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people may not be up to speed on what
710 is.
[SPEAKER_00]: As my buddy Adam Hill puts it,
710 is the new 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: 710 upside down says oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you write 710, flip it upside down,
that says oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend Task Rock wanted something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's been talking about 420 for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Task needed something to help represent
the oil movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So him and a few other folks coined the
phrase, 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the 710 movement became the new
concentrate movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: 710 is when you're supposed to take a fat
dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: 710 represents the oil movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where 710 came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what 710 is all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the 710 culture erupted from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 710 is all about smoking oil,
smoking concentrates, taking a dab,
[SPEAKER_00]: however you want to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has evolved so far since those days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember just a few years ago,
we would get concentrate that we thought
[SPEAKER_00]: was the most amazing shit on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would be completely impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started off as this kind of dark
colored, kind of looked like glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of looked like candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We called it shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started off like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it got a little better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then people started making it more clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started getting more shattery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got a little tastier.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started learning more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then people started making live resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started seeing a whole bunch of new
consistencies, a bunch of new textures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then a lot of us started laughing at
ourselves because something we were
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking six months ago, we would not even
touch at this new point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like the concentrate world keeps
evolving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like about every six months,
there's a brand new tech or a brand new
[SPEAKER_00]: product out that blows the concentrate
market away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I laugh because I'm thinking,
weren't we smoking the best shit on the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet just six months ago?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have vastly improved that to where
the things I was smoking in 2010,
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably would just pass and laugh at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I would not even consume that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went from that shattery stuff and we
had live resin and people started making
[SPEAKER_00]: better consistencies of live resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we started seeing sauce and turps
come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we started seeing big crystals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can go to the dispensary and you
can get just about any consistency you
[SPEAKER_00]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: On my table, I don't really fuck with
shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense to the people that still smoke
shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't smoke shatter anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've moved forward from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense if that's still what you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be in your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some batter here on the table
that kind of looks like cheesecake batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some HCFSE, it just looks like
diamonds and little rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some turps that is just saucy and
looks like golden water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of looks like a glass of tea with
ice cubes in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got all kinds of different textures
and consistencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have come so far in this oil industry
since we started this movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now people are learning how to squish buds
and they're making rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people making solid diamonds out
of rosin that they're making at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the 710 movement has come a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really give a lot of credit of the
coining of the phrase 710 to my buddy Task
[SPEAKER_00]: Rock from highly educated titanium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also now, highly educated quartz.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make great gavels and bangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has come a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we talk about 710, we are
generally talking about dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about the concentrate
movement that sort of spawned from the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is the cannabis crowd, but then the
dab crowd is a completely different level
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can spot the dab crowd when you go
to the cannabis events.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like that is a great way to
segue into talking about 710 events.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is coming up for 710?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing for the 710 holiday?
[SPEAKER_00]: 710 falls in the middle of the week this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will be events on the weekend
before and the weekend after 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that also means that when 710 happens
in the middle of the week, wherever you
[SPEAKER_00]: are, whatever you're doing, it is time to
get yourself a big fat dab and join the
[SPEAKER_00]: world and take a dab at 710 for the 710
movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be spending the weekend before 710
getting ready for an event.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weekend after 710, I will be at the
Dude Grows concentration celebration at
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivated Synergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivated Synergy is in Denver,
Colorado in the Rhino district.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is on the Saturday night after
710.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can be there, I look forward to
seeing you at the Dude Grows concentration
[SPEAKER_00]: celebration.
[SPEAKER_00]: For tickets and information on that event,
I would recommend you visit dudegrows.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a 710 cup tab right on the front
of their website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need for the
event should be easily accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I look forward to seeing you at the
Dude Grows concentration celebration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be there with my brand new booth
set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will also have dab and granny at my
booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come say hi, take a dab, get a hug from
dab and granny, get a hug from myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: take some photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will also have a very limited supply of
the brand new iRegenetics drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stop by the booth and say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to seeing you at the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am also doing a special drop for 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: On 710, I will be releasing three
feminized seed lines through my vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The things that will be available on 710
are Golden Goat Feminize Seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Gazum Feminize Seeds, and the
return of Lemon Jeffrey Feminize Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will all be available on 710 at
seedsherenow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be available at dankseed.store,
and you will be able to find them at
[SPEAKER_00]: oregoneliteseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check those three websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you grab them before they run
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I will have very limited supplies of
these new lines at the Dude Grows
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration celebration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're able to attend the event,
stop by the booth and grab some before
[SPEAKER_00]: they run out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Golden Goat is a golden goat S1,
that is a female golden goat pollinated by
[SPEAKER_00]: a reversed golden goat female that made
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a Golden Goat Feminize Seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Orange Gazum is a Platinum Tangy
Female pollinated by the reversed golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat, and the Lemon Jeffrey is a Lemon
Skunk pollinated by the reversed golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: All three of those have been quite sought
after, and they all three make amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you catch these before they
are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Feminized Seeds will also be available
at Organica in New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are a New Mexico medical
marijuana patient, Organica in Albuquerque
[SPEAKER_00]: will have the Feminized Seeds on 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is only available to New Mexico
medical marijuana patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have all of your New Mexico
medical marijuana paperwork up to work and
[SPEAKER_00]: valid, and you have to have your ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got all the proper paperwork,
stop by Organica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab yourself some Feminized Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell them Rasta Jeff sent you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like email updates about
where my seeds are available, if you would
[SPEAKER_00]: like email updates about sales I am having
or events I may be attending, or perhaps
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe I will send out coupon codes when
I'm dropping fresh strains, you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: inside information by joining my mailing
