[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I did say we were
going to talk about some seasonal
[SPEAKER_00]: adjustments here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am in southern Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not quite cold yet, but I do know
that hoodie season is soon approaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be fall here very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm surprised I haven't busted out the
hoodie yet, but I want to be prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to talk about this episode
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get ahead of the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to have our equipment in the
garage dusty, dirty, under a tarp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you need to order it from Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you need to figure that shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to be delayed on having
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be ahead of the game for
seasonal changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something that is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bigger the grow gets, the more
important that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy to change the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adjust the conditions in a smaller room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you start going 4, 6, 15,
20, 50, 100, lights, it gets increasingly
[SPEAKER_00]: more challenging to control the room,
control the space, adjust to the outside
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year in Colorado, we had a day where
it was negative 17 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the coldest weekends I've ever
experienced that I can remember in my
[SPEAKER_00]: adult life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely one of the coldest experiences
I can remember in my growing career.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think I saw negative 24 at one point
in my life that negative 17 really put
[SPEAKER_00]: some stress on my grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to be prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be prepared for things like
negative 17 coming up pretty soon here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The conditions, the environment,
the temperature changes rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, in Colorado, need to get my shit
together and need to get my gear prepared,
[SPEAKER_00]: get a strategy in place, start thinking
about what I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of seasonal changes are coming
in your location?
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be listening anywhere on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out wherever you are,
but think about the changes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to get colder?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to get hotter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will it be more humid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will it get drier?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you need to do to adjust your
grow, to set yourself up for success?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of my main goals of this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal is to help you set yourself up for
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a lot of trial and error.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a lot of experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to take a lot of that experience
and cut out a lot of bullshit,
[SPEAKER_00]: get you right to the point, set you up for
success, tell you a lot of things will
[SPEAKER_00]: fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to show you the best way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my main goal here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's focus in on a few of the
adjustments that I feel like I need to
[SPEAKER_00]: make for my grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm currently going from a warm summer
environment here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had 104 degree days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had 108.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might've been 112 in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some super hot days here over the
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have got LED lighting in my main
flowering space right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using a Canon lighting from
black sale market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to black sale market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over the summertime and over the spring
time, I had great success with the Canon
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting from black sale market.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I know that in the winter time,
those lights will not keep my grow space
[SPEAKER_00]: warm enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those lights are great for when it is hot
outside and I don't need warmth in my
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, but it is about to get really cold
and I'm going to use my grow lights to
[SPEAKER_00]: heat my grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'll use my grow lights to sort of
heat part of my living space as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heat will get ducted into my living
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be heating up the grow space with
the lights, exhausting that extra heat
[SPEAKER_00]: into my living room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way I don't have to turn on the
heater as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to use that electricity that I'm
already running for the grow lights to
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiently heat my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one adjustment I will make.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it gets just a touch cooler,
when I have a weekend available,
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to take down all of my LED
lighting and rehang my HPS lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will have high pressure sodium lights
for flower over the winter time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing that I definitely will
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with the Canon
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those Canon LEDs are amazing lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make beautiful plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants grow with great vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I will leave the Canons in one
area in a veg space because that area
[SPEAKER_00]: stays warmer just naturally and where the
grow space is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the flowering room does need to get
changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up against the exterior wall of the
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will get much colder there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to swap that out for HPSs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing wrong with the Canons other than
they don't make enough heat for the
[SPEAKER_00]: winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to hang a light that will
make enough heat for the winter and use
[SPEAKER_00]: that gear to my advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would I put up a heater when I've got
HPS lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: I could just throw those right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a heater, if you want to do
it, do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to use the HPS lights
because I've got them and then I can duct
[SPEAKER_00]: that heat that comes from those to another
room as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heat up part of the living space.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first major adjustment I will
make because I will use the HPS lights to
[SPEAKER_00]: heat up part of the house and the grow
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way my grow is set up, once I
change those lights, I will need to change
[SPEAKER_00]: my ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will also change the way I set up my
carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have caused a chain reaction of
things to set up and change in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a beautiful process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that resetting things up and
rebuilding things gives me a good
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to clean things that I may not
have cleaned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maintenance things that may not have
gotten the maintenance they needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are coming off of the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be down on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can clean every inch of it before it
goes back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll go into summer storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll wrap it up in plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will clean it, then wrap it up into
plastic, put it in summer storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way next summer when I need it or
when the winter, whichever, when I need
[SPEAKER_00]: that gear again, it's clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ready to rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to go polishing it,
but now is a good time to clean everything
[SPEAKER_00]: up, give everything a good once over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will probably repaint the walls while
I'm in the process of rebuilding
[SPEAKER_00]: everything, but I will definitely do the
different lighting and redo the ducting,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is going to lead me to redoing the
exiting of the room where the air,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ducting goes out, which is going to
lead to me repainting the entire room,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will probably lead to me redoing the
flooring in the entire room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like a task, but I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like a trigger for good work to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these things probably needed to
be done anyway, so this is a good time to
[SPEAKER_00]: do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seasonal change will trigger this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now things to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said I'm going to change my ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something to think about is the air that
you are bringing into your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where the air is coming in
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've got an air
conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you have a passive intake
and active intake.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we are bringing frosty cold air into
our warm grow environment where we've got
[SPEAKER_00]: grow lights going and it's nice and warm
in there, we're bringing basically icicles
[SPEAKER_00]: into the room that creates condensation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that really creates is opportunities
for powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already had enough powdery mildew
and the warm season in the spring and
[SPEAKER_00]: summer season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get away from that for the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got such dry conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's avoid powdery mildew and use those
dry conditions to our advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can bring that outside air into your
grow, but let's warm it up before it hits
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe bring it into another room,
warm it up, then shoot it into your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's not shoot that frosty cold air
directly into the grow directly over the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's got to go directly into the room,
if you don't have any other way to do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: run some ducting to where it goes
somewhere else further from the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it warms up a little bit before it
actually makes it to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good thing to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the water which you are feeding these
plants, where does the water come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it super cold?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I turn on the water outside in the
middle of winter, that water is super
[SPEAKER_00]: cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't want to put that water on my
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I get water from one spot in my house,
it is super cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I get water from the kitchen,
it's nice and room temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't feed your plants really cold water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wouldn't put your feet in there,
don't feed it to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants can't walk away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants can't pull their feet out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants can't say, ah, shit,
that's cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to get out of the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're stuck there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're torturing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't feed them super cold water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that water warmed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least 69, 70 degrees should be ideal
for a soilless soil, cocoa sort of a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing hydro, hold another ball
game, do your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys like to adjust your temperatures
accordingly to avoid the mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not an expert in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about something with soil,
soilless mix, cocoa, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't feed too cold of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will shock your roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be cool with that, especially if it gets
real cold outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that people often overlook
when it gets cold, how cold is the floor
[SPEAKER_00]: in your grow space?
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked a minute ago about putting cold
water on your feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you walk around in the grow space
barefoot and your feet not be too cold?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a good idea to walk around the
grow space barefoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one solid reason why I think it's
not a good idea to walk around the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space barefoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If and when we apply pesticides,
I apply pesticides on a routine basis in
[SPEAKER_00]: my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apply spray pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also spray foliar feeds, which we may
talk about more on this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apply a lot of things to that grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feed the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of shit ends up on that floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pesticides grow nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of stuff is on that floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do my best to keep it clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mop it, I clean it, I sweep it,
but there is stuff on that floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shouldn't be in there barefoot because
the bottoms of your feet are one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: most absorbent parts of your body for
chemicals, toxins, contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can suck up pesticides through the
bottoms of your feet quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technically, maybe you shouldn't be in
there barefoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, protect your toes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of hippie are you in there
barefoot anyway?
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's your style, be that way,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's risky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So walk around, see if the floor is cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the main point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it cold on your feet?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's cold on your feet, get the plants
up off of the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay to have a cold grow room floor,
but raise the plants up off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe just put them on a cinder block.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a very affordable way to get the
plants up off the floor is to flip another
[SPEAKER_00]: pot upside down and set the pot right on
that pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just you got one upside down, another pot
on another pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're that pot height taller and off
the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that's not the best because it
gets you too close to the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if I got a plant that's not
growing tall enough, that's how I get the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucker closer to the light and adjust that
plant to match the rest of the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But get them up off the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flip a pot upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use some cinder blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Build a table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get those plants off the floor because it
is probably quite cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about the air coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the cold water and think about
that cold intake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cold floor, cold water, cold intake.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all going to happen very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to freeze out these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to use that cold air to your
advantage, but don't blast the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't cause any frostbite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, this time of the year is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe time to turn off some things,
turn on some other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your full grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have your pulse monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what your minder unit is
telling you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to that and make the
adjustments, but I'm giving you a heads up
[SPEAKER_00]: the best I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the time to start thinking about
the equipment for the seasonal changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't say I can go buy that in two weeks
because everybody's going to go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow store and buy that in two weeks and
it's going to be gone, sold out,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially during these weird times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a really long time for shit to
get replenished, reshift and restocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get ahead of the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go get that shit now, especially if it's
in the budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's in the budget, why are you fucking
around?
[SPEAKER_00]: Go get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go get it before it goes in demand because
once it goes in high demand, they'll raise
[SPEAKER_00]: the price on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to go on sale when people
need more of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not the way this industry works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, go get the shit you need now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do all of the shit today that you can do
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is work that can happen in the
grow room, this is a side rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just some Rasta Jeff advice here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is work that can be done in the
grow room today or tomorrow and you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: time, energy, equipment and electricity
still to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the lights are on and if you're not
getting too much overtime and the boss
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't going to get on your ass,
get in there and do that stuff because
[SPEAKER_00]: tomorrow there's going to be more shit to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be some new shit to do that you
didn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially in a commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I am very experienced in working
in large commercial grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing I train people when I teach them
how to operate in a new grow, I say the
[SPEAKER_00]: first thing we do is we walk in and we
find out what went wrong last night
[SPEAKER_00]: because in a hundred flowering light
environment, you've got a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering lights, somewhere between 30 and
60 vegetative lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got clones, clone trays,
hydro pumps, fans, air conditioners,
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Computers, all kinds of shit in a big
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing we need to do when we walk
in is find out what went wrong last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's some stuff that you can get
done today, go ahead and do that stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: because I don't know what your surprises
are going to be tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have a five minute surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could, and I hope this doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could kick over a bucket, take you 15,
20 minutes to mop that bucket up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to go smoke a dab, get your shit
back together and regroup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's a 30 minute fucking waste of
your day that you didn't see coming or
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe just maybe I don't even want to jinx
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe something catastrophic goes wrong in
the grove and you don't get any of your
[SPEAKER_00]: side work done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get any of your main work done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now your side work, main work and
tomorrow's work is already fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get as much done today as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand we've got families,
we've got kids, we got dogs we want to run
[SPEAKER_00]: around with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got reggae shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to go see you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw the most amazing reggae show
tonight, today, earlier today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of late now that I'm recording,
but the vibe were high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got stuff we want to do in our lives,
but try to knock out those garden chores.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a small grove, it really
can't take that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a big grove, then you ask
for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in there and do the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what my job is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how long it should take.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how much to allow myself and I also
know that shit happens, surprises come up,
[SPEAKER_00]: things go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Murphy's law.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can go wrong fucking will and be
prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how you react, respond and adjust to
those things that make you a good grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you're prepared, those things are
much easier to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I'm fucking rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, that's the bottom line here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to succeed as much as you want
to be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want you to be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to go buy all this gear,
set up all this stuff, send me money on
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon, buy expensive seeds and then not
have a fruitful harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to make me feel bad,
especially if you bought my seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to my show and still didn't
succeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I kind of guided you and you
didn't get there, so I want us to get
[SPEAKER_00]: there together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to feel that pride that I feel
when I harvest some plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, Stone and Rambly, I'm telling
you, the reggae vibes are high tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a Patreon question here in front
of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get this one Patreon question going.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from my buddy Cinti Nasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I send me a lot of great stuff on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, one of them has made it to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one from my buddy Cinti goes a lot
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, your silver thiosulfate blend is
working bland.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said bland.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't say bland here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, let me try it in this camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe this camera will get it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your silver thiosulfate blend is working
amazingly on my auto flower project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a few episodes back, quite a few
episodes back, I gave an explanation on
[SPEAKER_00]: how to make silver thiosulfate to use for
reversing plants to make feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend Cinti Nasty here has used my
recipe to make some auto flower feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, which is a great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't make auto flower, so I'm glad
somebody else is out there doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said, I have followed your instructions
to a T and I'm getting a pretty decent
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is great to hear because sometimes
the recipe will take some adjustment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time you make that mix,
it might not be strong enough to reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be so strong it burns the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spray schedule may need to be more
frequently, less frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might not do anything to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are adjustments to be made per
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad that it worked for you on the
first try.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives me confidence that my mixture
is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very universal, versatile,
and it worked on your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That feels good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says big up for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It saved us a ton of money and I'm not
even close to using up the first batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, silver thiosulfate or at least the
components to make such are very
[SPEAKER_00]: affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I see people selling products to
reverse plants and I see companies selling
[SPEAKER_00]: silver thiosulfate for exorbitant amounts,
it drives me a little bit crazy because
[SPEAKER_00]: you can make hundreds of gallons for like
30 bucks, hundreds of gallons for maybe 30
[SPEAKER_00]: bucks and most of that 30 is probably
going to be shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two products you need are very
affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 bucks per bottle, 10 bucks for shipping
and then you need a gallon of distilled
[SPEAKER_00]: water every time you do it and that'll
make enough to reverse a plant and you got
[SPEAKER_00]: it covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really affordable in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I see the people charging too
much, it drives me crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just price gouging that's stabbing
at the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shouldn't be a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be able to have access to the
products which we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make your own silver thiosulfate much more
cost effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says this is kind of a breeding and
market question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is sort of a sales question,
a business question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a great person to ask this I would
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says knowing that the market is driving
femme and autoflower seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a breeder trying to serve the market,
does it make sense to search for elite
feed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Females more than trying out different
males.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a couple things to talk about
in that one sentence there in that one
[SPEAKER_00]: statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing that the market is driving on
femmes and autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the market loves feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than half of what I sell would be
femme seeds if I could make more femmes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't keep up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't make enough femmes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make a lot of regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about that in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're honestly easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get more pollen from a regular plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to reverse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reversing is science.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to learn each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a little more effort,
time, energy, space, work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the market is after femmes and autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are a lot of people who will not
grow feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of people who will not
grow autoflower seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are large portions of the cannabis
community who are opposed to both of
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not bashing those products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have nothing against autoflowers,
especially against feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people will not grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people feel that feminized seeds
are doing something wrong to the gene
[SPEAKER_00]: pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people just simply won't grow
those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to talk about a certain group
and why, but we don't need to go down that
[SPEAKER_00]: path today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep me a little bit focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people do want the reg seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people want the femmes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people want the autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that there's a market for all of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me follow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, as a breeder trying to serve the
market, does it make more sense to search
[SPEAKER_00]: for elite females more than trying out
different males?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to do both.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a breeder who wants to be relevant in
the market, that wants to be on top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: market, that wants customers, you have to
do both.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have a solid male plant at
least.
[SPEAKER_00]: The male plant is what sets you apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's got the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's growing the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entire community is growing the
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see those in large numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the breeders who are seeking out the
elite males that do the work to make new
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to find both.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to find the males that will
contribute to the gene pool and move the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants forward for our purpose,
whether my purpose is usually producing
[SPEAKER_00]: high-yielding plants with a lot of terps
and very high THC potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because that's what I enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like since I make a product that I
enjoy, I am successful because I'm doing
[SPEAKER_00]: it with my heart, for myself, and other
people like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a good musician.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your favorite musician wrote songs for
some girl, those songs are going to suck,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if your favorite musician writes songs
for themselves, they're going to be great
[SPEAKER_00]: songs and that girl will love it and so
will you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's why my brand works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make a product that I feel is up to my
standards, up to what I like, and you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: happen to like it also because I've got
high standards and I know what people
[SPEAKER_00]: want, what to expect, and what to look for
in quality cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it is finding that male.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it is finding the boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of my company is based on King
Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned Solomon later in this
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solomon is the stud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me a lot of searching,
a lot of hunting to find Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: First I had the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to find the plant that fit the
criteria which I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a list.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of an OCD guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I write lists on paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had to have all of these traits and
once I found a plant, a few plants with
[SPEAKER_00]: all of those traits, we bred with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we grew out those seeds and we had to
see what that male plant was doing to the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how I found Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why Solomon stands out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why my company stands out because
of that elite male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the other half of the equation,
you do have to have those elite females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having a stud and a bunch of half-assed
females to breed with won't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to make solid female selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I said before, the entire community
has got females.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all female hunting, female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got the beautiful advantage of I
can grow the plants and I can find my own
[SPEAKER_00]: females or we've got a squad of people out
there buying seeds, getting free seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: growing seeds, trading seeds, and they
find good keepers and somehow they end up
[SPEAKER_00]: back in my garden and I can breed with
those elite females as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is does it make sense to
search for elite females more than trying
[SPEAKER_00]: out different males?
[SPEAKER_00]: As a breeder who makes a lot of regular
seeds, I need to have solid males in my
[SPEAKER_00]: garden and I have to have a revolving
stable of quality females.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to keep a couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm limited on numbers so I keep a
percentage of my numbers for a male plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: a percentage for solid keeper females,
and then a percentage of my numbers go for
[SPEAKER_00]: rotating plants, something that's going to
come and go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I usually have a list of this many
and when I get a new plant, I go where
[SPEAKER_00]: does it fit in the list?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's got to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one on the bottom of the list,
that plant gets kicked out and the new
[SPEAKER_00]: ones come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I were to only make feminized seeds,
then I wouldn't even worry about boys and
[SPEAKER_00]: we would be searching for the best females
all the time and I would just breed stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: and find I would grow it first,
which I normally do, and I would find the
[SPEAKER_00]: winners out of there and then I would send
out the seeds and let you guys grow it
[SPEAKER_00]: next, but I would be one or two steps
ahead of you breeding with the new shit
[SPEAKER_00]: that you don't have yet so that I'm ahead
of everybody just a couple of steps,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is honestly kind of what I do with
my own line anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I were only to make fems,
yeah, we would be searching out a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: badass females and then just breed each
female to every female.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had a list of six girls, I take
number one and pollinate everybody else
[SPEAKER_00]: with it and then we take number two and
pollinate everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take number three, pollinate everybody
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just reverse that plant, pollinate
everybody with it is what we would have to
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like making red seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like watching what the boy does to the
plants, to the mix, to the recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of like that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like the boys in the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love feminized seeds also, but there's
just something about a male-female cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being a breeder, being somebody who's
deeply curious and passionate about
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics and breeding, that boy plant
means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to have both.
[SPEAKER_00]: The males are what separate us from each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our male is kind of like our style.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like our calling card.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our catchphrase or whatever you want
to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: The male is what does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one male can do a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like a reversed female can do a lot
of work, but if you've got nine females in
[SPEAKER_00]: the room, pollinate all nine of those
females from that one male and make nine
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses from one dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that's how I do it with King
Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put him in the room with just the
whole stable of ladies and let him go buck
[SPEAKER_00]: wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: He may be in a greenhouse right now,
getting frisky with like 12 beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: ladies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's got a hot, hot fucking weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me keep moving because I am kind of
rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to find my place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Furthermore, it says furthermore,
knowing that the market doesn't want male
[SPEAKER_00]: plants or most of the market, would it
make sense for breeders to start charging
[SPEAKER_00]: more, not less for regular seed
production?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is common.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said common.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put the bunch of seeds across
the screen again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is common that feminized seeds are
usually double the price of regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at my website, if you look at
most of my seed vendors, a regular pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds is 80 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: A feminized pack of seeds is 80 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the regular seeds, it's a 10 pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the fem seeds, it's a six pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're almost double the price.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is because I said earlier,
it takes more work, much more work in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion and in my experience to make a
feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to treat that donor,
the pollen donor plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to treat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be treated with a specific way
for about three or four weeks before
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to make it a plant that will
give you pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once it does reverse, sometimes they
don't make very much pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on how your recipe was,
you've got to adjust the recipe,
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect that, dial that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't get it right, you may have
just done a full run and not produced
[SPEAKER_00]: enough pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a bunch of buds with very minimal
seeds, kind of wasted a whole run there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to dial it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why fem seeds are more expensive
and regular seeds are generally half the
[SPEAKER_00]: price.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on top of that, regular seeds are
one price, fem seeds are double,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then auto flower fem seeds are double
that price.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're paying a lot more for your auto
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me keep reading because there is more
to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says,
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, with King Solomon in the stable,
it does make it hard to do any other work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just want to work with Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not put Solomon pollen on every female
cannabis plant in the world?
[SPEAKER_00]: Solomon is a stud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything he touches turns to fucking
gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes it hard to do other projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did find a Jack the Ripper male that
does amazing work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been playing with him and you
know, I do love to cross a few,
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse a few of those females I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, Solomon is a beast.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a true stud.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a lot of work, dedication,
time, energy and effort into finding that
[SPEAKER_00]: dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad it paid off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had to name him Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you understand anything about Solomon
and why he's named Solomon, big up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you'll do some research now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason for that name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I gave a lot of insight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you know what I think by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, lastly, I think you should
redo and re-release a lot of your early
[SPEAKER_00]: grow instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a bunch of new people and way
more podcast competition than he mentions
[SPEAKER_00]: his mentions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said mentions his.
[SPEAKER_00]: He mentions some of my podcast
competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel that anybody out there
podcasting his competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all bros.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the same exact goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our goal is to make you a better grower,
to give you better knowledge, to make you
[SPEAKER_00]: more comfortable in the grow room,
more comfortable with your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel it competitive any
competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that word twice in this sentence
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no competition, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all love.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, there are so many more podcasts
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now let's revisit the point of that
sentence redoing and re-releasing a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the old episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will work on doing that, but I get so
many messages and questions that redoing
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff sometimes is it's on the back
burner, keeping up with the current
[SPEAKER_00]: content, the current questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Staying on top of the Patreon questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those people do pay me to answer their
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that is priority.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always print out the Patreon questions,
bang those out first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I work my way to older questions,
stuff that's just on my mind that I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to ramble about, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will redo those episodes over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did the cloning episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did the bottom and lollipopping episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were just kind of redos of episodes
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you can do if you don't want
to wait for the redo is you can always go
[SPEAKER_00]: back and listen to the old episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're an old listener, a new listener,
if you've just discovered the podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: please do feel free to dive into the old
catalog of episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of great knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check out the way that the podcast has
changed, just grown over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, it was really scripted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote down most of what I was going to
say was on paper and I would just read it
[SPEAKER_00]: and just fucking do the show like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it got more comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I hit my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a chunk of episodes where I've got
I'm recovering and dealing with a
[SPEAKER_00]: traumatic brain injury and a lot of
weirdness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those episodes are really interesting to
listen to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just over time, things change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had a pandemic which taught me
a lot about podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when I went to video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go listen to the old stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the lessons you're looking for a
lot of questions you guys might have maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: hidden in those old episodes and I will
over time redo them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm slowly they're slowly organically re
happening the winter stuff I just talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure I've said a lot of that in an old
episode before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of it will get repeated recycled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt kind of weird about doing repeats
and recycled episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people have asked the same
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm realizing that a lot of podcast
listeners, you either do or you do not go
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to old episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen to old episodes,
you start at number one, and you listen
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way up to the current or you just
start where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of how podcast viewers and
listeners are two types of podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: viewers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got no judgment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they either go all the way back or
they don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got to redo a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I do invite you to go to listen to
that old shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, I am stoned and rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me wrap up this podcast while it still
sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cincy nasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cincy, thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me make sure I covered all the notes
because I did abandon this one quite
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, bro, we covered all of this point,
all of these points.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to have a male and good females.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just going to make femseeds,
then you don't have to worry about the
[SPEAKER_00]: boy, but you got to be certain that your
pollen donors are tried, true,
[SPEAKER_00]: tested and reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I covered all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for a great question,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the continued Patreon
support.
