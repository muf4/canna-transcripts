[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for episode number 215 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_03]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_03]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_03]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_03]: for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_03]: My friends call me Rossy Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_03]: Roots Band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to Kat, Koosh, and the
entire Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope everybody's having a good week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope you had a good weekend.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you're listening to this on Monday
when it comes out fresh.
[SPEAKER_03]: No matter what day of the week it is,
what time it is, wherever you are,
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you're having a good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you're smoking a fat joint,
maybe taking a dab with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been smoking on the, I've got some
Three Rivers Distillate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got some Three Rivers Organics
Dubwise Distillate.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was grown by me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually, extracted by the folks at
Peer Distilled.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really enjoying the Three Rivers
Dubwise Distillate.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been talking a lot about the HCFSE
and the HTFSE, the high cannabinoid full
[SPEAKER_03]: spectrum extract and the high terpene full
spectrum extract and all those extracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if I prefer the Distillate or
the HCFSE to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: To treat my, most of you folks that listen
to the podcast know I've got a little
[SPEAKER_03]: traumatic brain injury and sometimes it
fucks with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think smoking a fat dab of Distillate is
the quickest way to make my head noise go
[SPEAKER_03]: away, but sometimes I really enjoy the
effects of the high cannabinoid full
[SPEAKER_03]: spectrum extract crystals and a nice
chunky dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure which I prefer, so they're in
competition.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're both trying to win my heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will see which one wins.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do we start?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about this thermal banger.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had an eventful week.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you guys have had as good of a week
as I have.
[SPEAKER_03]: On Wednesday, I had an adventurous day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started off by hitting and heading to
Elevate, Elevate Glass, 517 South Tahone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I picked up in Colorado Springs,
I picked up a brand new thermal banger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me explain this thermal banger a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me explain a normal banger and then we
will kind of describe the thermal banger.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a normal banger, a banger fits on a
hash pipe, a bubbler, a small bong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I prefer a very small dab rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the part that you actually will
put the dab into.
[SPEAKER_03]: This part fits on your hash pipe,
your bubbler, your small bong,
[SPEAKER_03]: your little dab rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: A Hitman sidecar or a little mad rob or a
little Toro piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: This piece fits on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the part you heat up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You put the dab into here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of looks like it could be just a
normal bowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a stem that comes up and then
it's got a 90 degree angle and then
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a quartz, just a dish.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just looks like, you heat that up and
then you put your dab in there and then
[SPEAKER_03]: you put a carb cap on it and you take a
dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a normal dish.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just looks like you took a dish,
like maybe a thimble and then attached it
[SPEAKER_03]: to a way to put it onto the bong or onto
your rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and the idea is you heat that up and
then you let it cool a little bit and you
[SPEAKER_03]: put the dab in there and you cover it with
a carb cap and the carb cap stokes the
[SPEAKER_03]: heat and then you get a nice healthy dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the thermal banger, this is a little
bit different.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like they took the original idea of
the banger and then on the inside,
[SPEAKER_03]: they put another piece of glass,
which is where the dab will actually go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it's hard to explain.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a thimble with another thimble
inside of it, basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're both made out of glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all made out of glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's supposed to be quartz.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you heat the outside of this thermal
banger and the outer layer of glass gets
[SPEAKER_03]: really hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: The glass on the inside does not get hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: You drop your dab into the glass on the
inside and you cap it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this does a few things.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, the dab you just dropped on
there doesn't come in contact with the
[SPEAKER_03]: heated surface, so it doesn't cool the
nail down super quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're taking large dabs,
sometimes the hash will cool the nail and
[SPEAKER_03]: it will steal your heat so you don't get
all the dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that can't happen with this because
you're not actually putting the dab on the
[SPEAKER_03]: heated surface.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, it gives it low temp.
[SPEAKER_03]: We say low temps for taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to waste it to taste it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lower temps for better turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have realized that is not how I want to
dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like hot dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like my shit a little bit too hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am in the glow squad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to burn myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like wasting hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like going at it too hot and making sure
I get it all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not feel like the thermal banger is
something that I'm going to enjoy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to keep giving it a few tries.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might test it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked watching the HCFSE burn in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seemed to melt a little bit
differently.
[SPEAKER_03]: It puddled differently, but it is not my
style.
[SPEAKER_03]: The thermal banger is not Rasta Jeff
approved.
[SPEAKER_03]: I may have to get a different carb cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: I may have Barefoot come over and show me
how to use it a little differently,
[SPEAKER_03]: but so far from what I've played with and
what I've seen my friends do with it,
[SPEAKER_03]: that is not my style.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's for low temps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Low temp dabbing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like these hot, hot and hurty,
lung-burning dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know that the thermal banger is
for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying to bash a product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I want you to go buy one and try
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: See what you think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me know what you think about the
thermal banger.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got mine at Elevate Glass at 517 South
Nahon in beautiful downtown Colorado
[SPEAKER_03]: Springs, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get one.
[SPEAKER_03]: See what you think about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to my friends at Elevate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was talking about my amazing day on
Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk a little bit more about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than getting the thermal banger,
we headed up to Denver.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started my evening with a Metallica
concert.
[SPEAKER_03]: We headed up to Denver and there were two
opening acts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the first band was called Volby.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then after that, it was Avenged Sevenfold.
[SPEAKER_03]: No offense to anybody that's into either
of those bands or those bands.
[SPEAKER_03]: I purposefully missed them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was not into those bands at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to see Metallica.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not really into the hard rock metal
thing, honestly, but I grew up on
[SPEAKER_03]: Metallica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Metallica was my first favorite band.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there may have been bands before
that when I was a little kid and didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: know any better, but I think when I was
becoming a rebellious teenager,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Metallica is what helped me do
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to wear a Metallica shirt every
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: My closet was just filled with black
Metallica shirts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had all of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they put out a Metallica shirt in that
era, I had it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been a Metallica fan for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a drummer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've played drums.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I got drums for my 14th or 15th
birthday.
[SPEAKER_03]: The drummer for Metallica was the dude
that inspired me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was about probably 13 or 14 years old,
and my uncles, they're bad influences on
[SPEAKER_03]: me, but they're really cool dudes,
they decided to take me to a concert in
[SPEAKER_03]: California.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd never been to a big stadium concert.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd been to little shitty gigs and stuff,
but I'd never been to a real concert.
[SPEAKER_03]: My uncles Ron and Eric, shout out dudes,
they took me to see some shitty bands.
[SPEAKER_03]: They took me to see Jackal and the Damn
Yankees.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the coolest bands on the planet,
but when you're a 14-year-old kid or a
[SPEAKER_03]: 13-year-old kid, fucking drums and guitars
and loud and lots of people, and
[SPEAKER_03]: weird-looking freaks and boobs everywhere,
it was a great time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how does Metallica tie into that?
[SPEAKER_03]: My uncles, my uncle Eric had a Chevy El
Camino.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a super fucking white trash rock
star ride.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like a truck.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of lowered, but it had a camper
shell on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my uncles were in the front,
and I was in the back part where the
[SPEAKER_03]: camper shell is, and there was no window
between us and them, or between myself and
[SPEAKER_03]: them, and they smoked a joint and put on
the black album.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd been smoking a little bit of weed with
a friend of mine, but not regularly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hadn't become a pothead yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: They put on the black album.
[SPEAKER_03]: It starts with Inner Sandman, and then
it's Sad But True, and then I think it's
[SPEAKER_03]: Through The Never, maybe, or Holier Than
Now, but Inner Sandman and Sad But True
[SPEAKER_03]: are all you fucking need.
[SPEAKER_03]: It starts the whole album off.
[SPEAKER_03]: It starts the whole day off perfectly.
[SPEAKER_03]: They smoked the joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure I got a little stoned from
the joint that they smoked in the front of
[SPEAKER_03]: the car, because they just hotboxed that
bitch.
[SPEAKER_03]: They rolled up the windows and smoked on
the highway.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all the smoke came to the back of the
car, where I was.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got good and stoned.
[SPEAKER_03]: That day, I decided I was going to be a
drummer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew that I had to play the drums,
and that joint that my uncle smoked and
[SPEAKER_03]: Metallica and that adventure that day
changed me, and that told me that day,
[SPEAKER_03]: hey, you're going to be a drummer.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is part of your fucking life.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've been a huge Metallica fan since
then.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was already a Metallica fan,
but that's what sold me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting stoned with my older uncles on
accident.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even think they realized they were
getting me high in the car.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were just doing their own thing,
but I got stoned with them, saw a great
[SPEAKER_03]: concert, and then they just changed my
life.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure that the next day, I was
obnoxious, air drumming on everything,
[SPEAKER_03]: drumming on the desk at school.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually got kicked out of several
classes in school.
[SPEAKER_03]: It continued all the way through my high
school career.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got kicked out of all my classes for
drumming on the desk, and eventually my
[SPEAKER_03]: last year of high school, I only had band
classes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not a joke.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so I drove up and saw
Metallica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Metallica was fucking awesome,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sports Authority Field is huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck trying to park it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that place.
[SPEAKER_03]: It took me, no joke, 30, maybe 45,
maybe an hour to find a parking place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eventually, I ended up paying $25 for a
parking space, ended up paying $20 more
[SPEAKER_03]: for a pedal cab to get me from that
parking space to the venue.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was worth the ride.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was worth paying the little dude to
pedal me around.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: He knew a lot of stuff about Denver,
knew about the area.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was helpful.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, man, fuck parking, but once we got
there, it was cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once we got into the venue, it was cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I timed it beautifully.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got some food on the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: We stopped at Elevator.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, we hit some traffic.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a little bit of rain.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had to drive around and find parking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once we got into the venue, we had time to
find... We got some snacks.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a slice of pizza.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got some drinks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just Coke, so you guys know beer or
nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't go crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't drink at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we found our seats, and we looked
around, and I talked to the guy next to
[SPEAKER_03]: me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, what's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he goes, it's going, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently the guy in front of me was
super drunk and being an asshole and
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to talk to everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did not want to talk to me,
so that was cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Metallica came out shortly after that and
did quite a few cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: They did mostly new stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: They did the Atlas Rise, and they did...
There's another one that I can't fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: hardwired to self-destruct.
[SPEAKER_03]: They did those.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a huge fan of the new stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just... Like everybody says,
everyone that's a fan of music,
[SPEAKER_03]: they all like the old stuff better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody just says, I want to hear the
old stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of how I felt about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking at my phone because I made a
note, really a list of songs that they
[SPEAKER_03]: played, but I cannot find it here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I have it in my phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were jamming.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were rocking out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They did For Whom the Bell Tolls,
and they did another song.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after that, the band looked kind
of confused.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were like, I'm not sure what's
happening here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they all walked off the stage,
and a dude came on the microphone over the
[SPEAKER_03]: PA system, and he said, hey guys,
we are not canceling the show,
[SPEAKER_03]: but there's a major lightning storm over
Denver right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you could see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: People had been watching it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, there's a major lightning
storm.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need everybody to exit the grandstand,
which this is the football stadium in
[SPEAKER_03]: Denver.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need everyone to exit the grandstand
and please make your way safely to the
[SPEAKER_03]: concourse.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we all had to get up out of our seats
and go find a shelter basically from the
[SPEAKER_03]: rain and from the lightning in the
concourse at Sports Authority Field.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was crowded.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was obnoxious.
[SPEAKER_03]: People were smoking and blowing fucking
cigarette smoke in my face.
[SPEAKER_03]: Half the people were drunk and ridiculous,
but I knew that if I waited, there was
[SPEAKER_03]: more Metallica.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm scrolling through my phone slowly
here because I made a couple of notes on
[SPEAKER_03]: songs that they played.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't find the note, which is weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, Metallica did come back on.
[SPEAKER_03]: We made it back to our seats.
[SPEAKER_03]: Metallica came back on.
[SPEAKER_03]: They played, I think they played Motor
Breath at that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they talked for a couple of
seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: James Hetfield actually gave a little bit
of a speech.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, hey, I forgot exactly how he
said it, but he talked about, I don't care
[SPEAKER_03]: if you voted for this guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care if you voted for that guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care if you drink this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care if you smoke that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care if you believe in a god.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care if you don't believe in a
god.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's basically said, we're here to fucking
party and listen to Metallica.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're all fucking friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck all that bullshit, which I thought
was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they played.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then James asked, do you guys want some
hard stuff?
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course the crowd was like,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And James Hetfield from Metallica is kind
of funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: He tries to be a comedian on stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a pretty good front dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then he's like, you guys want to hear some
hard stuff?
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course the crowd was like,
fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's when I really feel like
Metallica started firing it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: They did Sad But True.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they did One.
[SPEAKER_03]: Followed by Master of Puppets.
[SPEAKER_03]: Followed by Creeping Death.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they brought out another drum set and
set it at the very front edge of the
[SPEAKER_03]: stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, this was at Sports Authority
Field.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a mile away.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a mile high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus I was a mile away from the fucking
stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody looked like they were about a
quarter inch tall from where I could see
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: The drum set was just a blur.
[SPEAKER_03]: The backdrop was amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The backdrop was so cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had 50 foot tall video screens.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would play video games.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had videos on.
[SPEAKER_03]: The pyrotechnics were pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pretty bitching.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then they did Seek and Destroy on the
front of the stage like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they did Fight Fire with Fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then there are a couple more songs that I
did not make a note of.
[SPEAKER_03]: They shredded for a little while longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember hearing Creeping Death in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fade to Black was in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they on-chord, of course,
with fucking Inner Sandman.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody sang Inner Sandman.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a great show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of great pyrotechnics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, I was a mile away.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in the back section of the Sports
Authority Field.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when some of the pyrotechnics would go
off, I could feel the heat.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could tell that my date was cold because
it was getting chilly and it was raining.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could tell that she would feel relieved
when some of the pyrotechnics would go
[SPEAKER_03]: off.
[SPEAKER_03]: She'd be like, oh, warmth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she would reach to it like a little
heater.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Metallica was fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Metallica shredded all night.
[SPEAKER_03]: The show ended.
[SPEAKER_03]: It took us a little bit to get out of
there because humans are fucking cattle
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're half retarded.
[SPEAKER_03]: But once we got out of there, we made it
to the car.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we headed to Cervantes' Other
Side at Five Points in Denver because one
[SPEAKER_03]: of my favorite reggae artists,
Capelton, was playing at Cervantes' Other
[SPEAKER_03]: Side.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we walked in, he was already playing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like he'd only been going for a few
songs because he went for a good 45
[SPEAKER_03]: minutes to an hour or so after we got
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, Capelton is a reggae artist who is
known for playing really high energy sets
[SPEAKER_03]: at Reggae Sunsplash and Rototom,
a reggae music festival.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check him out, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were into reggae music,
if you were into high energy music,
[SPEAKER_03]: check out Capelton.
[SPEAKER_03]: Capelton put on a great show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to everybody at Cervantes' Other
Side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, I had a good time there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not a lot to talk about about the
Capelton show.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Metallica show was huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many people, so much pyrotechnics.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Capelton show was a small club show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to say maybe three, maybe 500
people there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There couldn't have been 500 people in
that club.
[SPEAKER_03]: But every single person was paying
attention to every single moment of that
[SPEAKER_03]: Capelton concert.
[SPEAKER_03]: He speaks, the way he speaks, you just
have to listen.
[SPEAKER_03]: You cannot turn your head when Capelton
speaks.
[SPEAKER_03]: He really gets your attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had a huge weekend seeing some music.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tomorrow night, actually, I will be seeing
Dead & Co.
[SPEAKER_03]: at Folsom Field in Boulder, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I look forward to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I've got a whole bunch more cool
stuff coming up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Phish.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm super excited to see Phish.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to do all three nights.
[SPEAKER_03]: of Phish at Dick's Sporting Goods.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I've got some comedy shows coming up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a great summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, let me know if you're going to any
shows.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to go see some reggae
music, if you're going to go see whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of music you're going to go see,
whatever you're doing for summer fun,
[SPEAKER_03]: let me know what you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to hear about it because I just got
to brag for like a good 15 minutes about
[SPEAKER_03]: all the cool shit that I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me know what you're doing this summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me know how you are involving cannabis
in your summer fun plans.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_03]: Growfromyourheartathotmail.com or you can
tweet me at GFYHpodcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's move this podcast forward just a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, there are over 50 YouTube videos
posted.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I've got video number 52 or 53 is
up now.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the time you listen to this,
53 should be posted.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank everybody who has been
subscribing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been getting a lot of video views and
a lot of subscribers already.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've only got 50 something videos.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got another 160 to put up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate everyone who has
subscribed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to check out the videos of the
first 50 episodes, go to YouTube and just
[SPEAKER_03]: search for the Grow From Your Heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Click subscribe on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, you guys, the first 50 videos
are a mess.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not a lot of effort put into them
because I'm just trying to get them out
[SPEAKER_03]: there and get caught up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once I get caught up, the videos will get
better.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what I'm doing now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've played with iMovie enough to kind of
have a little clue on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just need to take some time,
make some effort and get caught up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes, however long the podcast is,
it takes about two or three times that
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of time to make the video for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus it takes like another two hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two hours for it to upload.
[SPEAKER_03]: And while it's uploading, I can't work on
the computer very much because the way
[SPEAKER_03]: that iMovie works, if you change anything,
it fucks everything up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it kind of ties up my computer for two
or three hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I try to make the videos at night and
then launch one up before I go to bed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'll make another one early in
the morning and start launching it to
[SPEAKER_03]: YouTube before I go to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that way it's loading while I'm busy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, the videos are happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would appreciate it if you
subscribe.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a way for you to listen to old
episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So also I want to know what you think of
the Thursday episodes I've been putting
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been putting out old episodes,
blocks of old episodes on Thursdays.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm calling it Throwback Thursday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me know what you think of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: A few people have emailed me and said that
they appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: One person asked me to put the titles of
the old episodes in there so they know
[SPEAKER_03]: what they're listening for.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will try to remember to do that,
but honestly it's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes I don't even listen to the
old episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have to make the chunks of shows
and put them out and get them to you
[SPEAKER_03]: because I am a little bit overwhelmed with
all of my commitments and projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: Priorities to tell you the damn truth,
but I love getting the podcast out to you
[SPEAKER_03]: guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's always going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't missed a single Monday in three
years, 215 episodes I haven't missed to
[SPEAKER_03]: show you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm dedicated, I promise.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I want to keep moving the
podcast forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am going to talk about cannabis in the
show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I promise I've just got a whole bunch of
other shit on my mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: If this episode doesn't keep you
entertained, there'll be another podcast
[SPEAKER_03]: coming out Thursday and there'll be
another one Monday.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope I don't lose you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about Patreon right quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I haven't talked about ganja at
all, but we're going to Patreon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I owe a few people some thank yous.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if people want me to say
their real names on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just going to cover everybody in
one gigantic thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, if you have contributed on
Patreon, thank you for your contribution.
[SPEAKER_03]: I truly appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does not go unnoticed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every contribution is appreciated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see it, I get an alert and this is my
thank you to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if I'm supposed to say your
name because I don't know if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: supposed to be known that you're donating
your money to a podcast or if you're even
[SPEAKER_03]: supposed to be known that you're listening
to a ganja podcast or if it's even
[SPEAKER_03]: supposed to be known that you're growing
cannabis or supporting cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't say people's names.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to be better about that,
but thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't know what Patreon is,
let me explain it really quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Patreon is a service that allows you as a
listener to financially contribute to the
[SPEAKER_03]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you feel like the podcast was worth a
couple of bucks of your time, all you have
[SPEAKER_03]: to do is go to patreon.com slash grow from
your heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: You put in a little bit of information,
your name, address, phone number,
[SPEAKER_03]: all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it will ask for your credit card
number.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once it asks for that, you get to decide
how much you want to contribute.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can sign up for a monthly
contribution, which is known as a
[SPEAKER_03]: subscription, or you can sign up for a
one-time contribution.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's up to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you sign up for a monthly, your credit
card will be billed on the first of every
[SPEAKER_03]: month for the amount that you decide to
contribute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that will be taken from your credit
card and put directly into my PayPal
[SPEAKER_03]: account on the third of the month.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now what I am going to do with those funds
is I will use those funds to pay for my
[SPEAKER_03]: website, iregeneticscolorado.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is where I host this podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my way of keeping the podcast free
for the general public.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody can listen to this podcast for
free.
[SPEAKER_03]: 100 episodes of this podcast are always
kept in the feed for free.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus I'm updating all of the old episodes
on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've got the entire archive to listen
to for free forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not need everybody to pay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want you to listen to the show for free
and I want you to appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want you to enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want you to learn how to grow better.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want you to teach people the right ways
about cannabis and break the myths and
[SPEAKER_03]: break the truths, support cannabis,
legalize cannabis and get everybody
[SPEAKER_03]: healing themselves with proper cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want it to happen for free.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are people out there, however,
who do want to contribute and who are able
[SPEAKER_03]: to contribute to the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those folks can do so by going to
patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can't contribute, I still love you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still want you to listen and I still
want you on my team.
[SPEAKER_03]: This podcast is still for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like an evangelist for a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to hold off on all this
Patreon talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about some ganja related
madness.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's something I've wanted to talk about
because it's something I've been
[SPEAKER_03]: experiencing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys ever go through phases where
sometimes you can smoke all of the hash or
[SPEAKER_03]: all of the weed and nothing happens?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've got days where I feel like I
could just open up my shatter and just
[SPEAKER_03]: take half gram dabs all day and I don't
get high properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'll get a little bit of a woo for a
couple of seconds, but then I'm just like,
[SPEAKER_03]: that was fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it'll last for days like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll feel like I just smoke all of my
hash and all of my weed and I just keep
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking and nothing happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then one day it'll flip to where I can
think about smoking some hash and I just
[SPEAKER_03]: feel high as shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, Oh God damn, I'm super high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or some days you just open up the
parchment and before you even get the
[SPEAKER_03]: dabber on the nail, you're like,
why am I so high already?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there some days I can take just a
little dab and get super wrecked?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really odd.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been noticing that I go through
phases where I can smoke all of the hash
[SPEAKER_03]: and then it'll flip on me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I could just barely smoke and get
wrecked.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been trying to pay attention to a
few things and see what causes this and
[SPEAKER_03]: what is related to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first thing I would say is it's
directly related to my hydration.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I have not been drinking enough water,
my lungs hurt when I take a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can feel it.
[SPEAKER_03]: My lungs are like, dude, that's hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hydrate yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how much food I have consumed and what
kind of food.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I've had a lot of sugary stuff,
I can't get high properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes if I've had too much caffeine
and too many sugary snacks and I take a
[SPEAKER_03]: dab, instead of getting high properly,
I just get jittery and anxious and I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: feel good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have to wait like through the
initial high of the dab to feel okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a good 15 or 20 minutes later,
once the blood sugar and the fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: Mountain Dew or the Dr. Pepper sugar and
the cookies and the dab all stop fighting
[SPEAKER_03]: each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's directly related to my hydration
and my food consumption and my blood
[SPEAKER_03]: sugar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of those three together are the
most main components.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's mostly hydration because I can
take huge dabs if I'm well hydrated.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I wake up and just hydrate heavily and
then start taking big globs, I can smoke
[SPEAKER_03]: heavy all day and my lungs are okay with
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I don't drink plenty of water and I
start taking big dabs, my lungs burn.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then by the late part of the day,
I don't want to dab hard anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm tired and worn out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think a lot of my thing is directly
related to hydration, which is directly
[SPEAKER_03]: related to my blood sugar.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like when I don't have the right
food, I get high and I get lazy and I get
[SPEAKER_03]: wrecked.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I eat right, I get high and I get
uplifted and I feel much better.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also think that a lot of my being able
to get really wrecked and not being able
[SPEAKER_03]: to get high properly has stuff to do with
the weather.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it's really hot outside, I don't even
like to get real high.
[SPEAKER_03]: I skipped an opportunity to go smoke with
some friends today because it was 90
[SPEAKER_03]: degrees outside and there wasn't anywhere
cool to go smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just too hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just being in the car, if we would
have gone to the car to smoke,
[SPEAKER_03]: if we would have gone somewhere else to
smoke, just being outside back in the heat
[SPEAKER_03]: is just going to fucking ruin my day and
give me a headache and make me lazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sometimes the weather has stuff to do
with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like to get too blazed in the too
hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it's cold, let's smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, I can smoke all of the hash
when it's cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just something about it that I
really enjoy being wherever out in the
[SPEAKER_03]: car, out in the backyard, camping,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just smoke when it's cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can handle that.
[SPEAKER_03]: My body likes it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's probably because I'm not getting
so dehydrated and I'm not just trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: survive and my hydration isn't suffering.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing that affects my ability to
medicate or get high properly is my stress
[SPEAKER_03]: and anxiety level.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm stressed, have you guys ever
experienced this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you been, maybe you got high and you
went for a drive or maybe you got high and
[SPEAKER_03]: you had an experience that some adrenaline
kicked in and you can't be high anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you noticed your high just fucking
goes away at those points?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or have you ever had just something scare
you and just blow your whole high?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like maybe you get pulled over and as soon
as you see those red and blues,
[SPEAKER_03]: miraculously, I am not even high anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think stress kind of blocks my ability
to get blazed properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm too worried about work or
podcasting or whatever it is that people
[SPEAKER_03]: worry about nowadays, half the time it's
dumb shit that we fucking invented anyway
[SPEAKER_03]: because this is just a fake world that we
live in.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should be doing totally different shit
than what we do with our lives.
[SPEAKER_03]: But see, that stress right there is what I
think fucks with my high sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just doesn't let me get where I want to
be because I'm too stressed with the
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking world and with stupid shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also environment, I feel like when I smoke
at this table at this spot right here,
[SPEAKER_03]: I could never get too high at this spot
because I'm in my comfort zone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a bottle of Dr. Pepper right
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a bottle of water right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got all my apothecary jars right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: My iPad's right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: My phone's right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: My computer's right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: My bed is like 30 steps from here.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a refrigerator full of goodies
right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a TV over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not a lot could go wrong in this
environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I feel like when I smoke right here,
I allow myself to get pretty high,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I get in a bubble.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get in this productive bubble.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to clean this area up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to organize all this shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I want to start writing podcasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to start just, this is my creative
zone of my space right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I smoke right here, certain things
happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I were to go, I know I keep talking
about the car.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I medicate in my car.
[SPEAKER_03]: The vibe is completely different.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I get much more medicated when
I smoke in the car because I'm not in my
[SPEAKER_03]: comfort zone.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm a passenger or a driver,
if I'm out smoking in the car,
[SPEAKER_03]: I get way more blazed because my mind is
more stimulated and I can't just be here
[SPEAKER_03]: in my bubble.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I'm here in my bubble, I don't have
to worry about anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: My sense is no, you're safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can turn off.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I'm out in public, I'm like a fucking
deer out in the danger and everything is
[SPEAKER_03]: just blinking at me and I got to pay
attention to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I get blazed, I see that even more
and I get even higher from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So also I think when I go to places like
the Canna Canyon, my high is way different
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's a social high.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't get blackout blazed or silent
blazed because sometimes I like to smoke
[SPEAKER_03]: myself into a silent stupor.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I enjoy when I'm alone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it makes my mind go and gets me
creative and I just start flowing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can't do that at places like the
Canna Canyon because people want to talk
[SPEAKER_03]: to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think my environment has a huge part
about how my high plays out and how high
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm able to get and just how much I
notice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I don't notice that I'm super high
when I'm sitting at this table because
[SPEAKER_03]: nothing can go wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe you do notice that you're super
blazed after two dabs when you're out at
[SPEAKER_03]: the mall just because you feel like
everyone's looking at you just because
[SPEAKER_03]: you're aware.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think environment plays a huge part
in how high I am and am not able to get.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I really don't like to do that a
lot of my friends love to do, they like to
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke and then eat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I am the exact opposite.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to eat and then when I'm done
eating and I don't need any more food,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's when I toke down and get blazed
because I feel like if I eat right after I
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke, I pretty much just wasted the food
and I wasted those dabs because they're
[SPEAKER_03]: both just going to balance each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just going to negate each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't notice either one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So eat a big, fat meal, get nice and
nourished, get comfy, then a chug of a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit of water.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then right after that, the dab time.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, you guys, I've been rambling
for like 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am going to press pause for a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to take one of those dabs I've
been talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also going to take a couple of drinks
and then I will be right back and we are
[SPEAKER_03]: going to read an email from a listener.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Podcast World, I am back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got hydrated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely took way too many dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was dabbing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lemon Jeffrey high cannabinoid full
spectrum extract with a little bit of high
[SPEAKER_03]: terpene full spectrum extract poured into
it with a little bit of Dubwise distillate
[SPEAKER_03]: dropped on top of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I rolled that sticky dab into a
little bit of this THCA powder and then I
[SPEAKER_03]: got way too lit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I coughed for about seven minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I blew about a gallon of snot out of my
nose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I think I've got my shit together and
we're going to try to do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so I got an email from
somebody.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if I'm supposed to use their
name.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we're just going to skip that.
[SPEAKER_03]: This email comes from a listener and if
you'd like to email me, you can send me an
[SPEAKER_03]: email at growfromyourheartatahotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'll read your email on a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: This email goes like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey brother, did I hear that correctly?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he says half asleep on a
throwback episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember where.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you say that you switched back to 18.6
for late flush?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you still do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in the hydro days, I would sometimes
put them back into total blackout for the
[SPEAKER_03]: last two or three days.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never heard going back to more light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you mind giving your thoughts behind
that?
[SPEAKER_03]: To tell you the truth, bro, I don't think
I said that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope I did not say that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do remember one instance where that may
be useful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have talked about revegging your plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only reason that I would recommend
going to more light at the end of flower
[SPEAKER_03]: would be to revert your plant back to the
veg stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only time it's useful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not go back to 18.6 at the end of
flowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to change your time at the
end of your flower period, I would go with
[SPEAKER_03]: more darkness and less light.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe go from 12.12 to 14 hours of
darkness and 10 hours of light,
[SPEAKER_03]: or maybe increase your dark period.
[SPEAKER_03]: But do not add light to the end of your
flowering period.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll fuck your plants up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will confuse them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will make them think that it's time to
reveg.
[SPEAKER_03]: They will start revegging.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to reveg, that is something
you can do.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you don't want to reveg the plant,
don't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You must have been happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might have been half asleep,
you might have been high, and it's fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: weird that you're dreaming about me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But please don't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thanks for the email.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's more to this email I'm going to
keep reading.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, I really like your show,
incidentally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only recently discovered it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep up the good work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep up the good hard work ethic,
the fun, and I appreciate the rallying
[SPEAKER_03]: content, which is always solid.
[SPEAKER_03]: I learn stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think new thoughts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I respect the point of view, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm good with you using the content of
this email in any episodes or not,
[SPEAKER_03]: as you prefer, but no name, please,
as I'm in not land.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think he meant to type, I'm in
prohibition land, or not legal land.
[SPEAKER_03]: He skipped the word there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then he says, thanks, man,
and he signs his name.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you did not try to put this 18.6
into practice at the end of your flowering
[SPEAKER_03]: phase, because that would have caused you
problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I would have felt like a dick for
messing up your crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about the only reason that
would be useful, because this is where I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: sure you got this idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only time that going to 18.6 at the
end of your flowering phase would be
[SPEAKER_03]: useful is if you plan to revege that
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only time that that's useful is if you
do not have a clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say you got a clone from your
friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: You grew it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You thought your buddy had more clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: He doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: That weed that you grew about week six,
week seven, you realize this is the best
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking weed I have ever grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to grow this more.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are no clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are no other options.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only plant of that strain left.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's what you could do.
[SPEAKER_03]: 14 days before harvest, you can turn your
light timer back to 18.6, or you can put
[SPEAKER_03]: it on 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: That will make the plant start thinking
it's time to go back into veg.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that 14 days will not be enough time
for the plant to actually return to veg if
[SPEAKER_03]: you cut it down as predicted in 14 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're going to cut down most of the
plant and you will leave about four,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe five or six shoots at the very
bottom of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just small little buds with just enough to
keep the plant alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you put that back into the 24 or
18.6 after you harvest the rest of the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant, the remaining plant will eventually
turn itself back to veg.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you are speeding it up and buying
yourself time by putting it under the veg
[SPEAKER_03]: flowering cycle while you're in flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just going to save you time to
revert your plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, if you're trying to revert it,
feed it a high nitrogen diet and also add
[SPEAKER_03]: some sea kelp to there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are tricks that you can do with
gibberellic acid.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have enough experience to talk
about it on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to research revegging your
plant by using gibberellic acid,
[SPEAKER_03]: it is very possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know somebody who does it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That information is very easily available
online.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not enough experience with it to
talk about it myself, but I encourage you
[SPEAKER_03]: to try it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't have a clone of your favorite
plant, you can reveg it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's the only time that I think that
increasing your light cycle at the end of
[SPEAKER_03]: a flowering phase would be useful.
[SPEAKER_03]: So please, like I said earlier,
don't do that to your normal flowering
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're trying to speed them up,
if you're trying to make them hardier,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you're trying to make things change,
reduce the light because these plants are
[SPEAKER_03]: photosensitive.
[SPEAKER_03]: The light does 90% of the shit to these
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gives it all of the signals.
[SPEAKER_03]: It tells it what's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you start adding more, it thinks the
days are getting longer, which means it
[SPEAKER_03]: thinks it needs to veg.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you reduce time, it thinks days are
getting shorter, which makes it think it
[SPEAKER_03]: needs to finish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a tip that I gave somebody online
just recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: This tip was about a very specific strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a strain that goes around Colorado
right now that produces very delicious
[SPEAKER_03]: oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hash that comes from this plant is
fucking delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: The turps that come out of this are
amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Top shelf turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's what everybody wants.
[SPEAKER_03]: The flowers are ugly as shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: This plant doesn't finish up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would take, you could probably let this
plant go 12 to 14 weeks and it would
[SPEAKER_03]: finish up nicely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people don't have that much time and
they're impatient and they don't
[SPEAKER_03]: understand what's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had the opportunity to play with this
plant several times and what I learned,
[SPEAKER_03]: and this was just thinking and trying to
figure out how to speed up the plant and
[SPEAKER_03]: thinking what I could do, I simply reduced
the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I go from 12, 12 when I'm in flower,
about the end of week seven or eight,
[SPEAKER_03]: I drop it from 12, 12 to 10 on,
and 14 off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm giving it 10 hours of daylight and
14 hours of darkness.
[SPEAKER_03]: It thinks the days are getting shorter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll let it go for about a week like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I'll take two more hours off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm only running that light for eight
hours a day on and 16 hours a day off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now this plant is thinking that winter is
coming and it says, what the fuck am I
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna do?
[SPEAKER_03]: I must reproduce.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it starts making fatter and fatter
buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: The trichomes start ripening up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I make it a little colder in the room,
drop it just three or four more degrees,
[SPEAKER_03]: get it nice and chilly in there at night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those plants will finish up much more
quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can cut two to three weeks off of
these plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of 14 weeks, you can finish these
plants at 10 or 11 weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've cut them down at the end of week 10
and I've considered them to be done,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you've got to speed them up by
reducing the timer late in flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do it at week six, you're kind of
cutting yourself off of optimal growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do it at week seven, at the end of
week seven, you can really start speeding
[SPEAKER_03]: up the finishing time of long or flowering
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, you guys, I want to thank
everybody for listening to this semi short
[SPEAKER_03]: episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I didn't talk a whole lot about
cannabis and I did not give a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: useful information, but I hope you had fun
hanging out with me anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a long productive week.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not have as much time for the
podcast as I would like to have had,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I will bring you a better episode next
week.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to get myself ready to go see the
Grateful Dead tomorrow in Boulder.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the Grateful Dead, but it's close
enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's dead and co.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is most of the remaining Grateful Dead
members.
[SPEAKER_03]: That are alive, minus Phil Lesh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Phil's taking it easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's staying in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the original bass player right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got Oteel Burbridge on bass and
also they've got John Mayer on lead
[SPEAKER_03]: guitar.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you haven't seen dead and co with John
Mayer on guitar, you're probably going,
[SPEAKER_03]: what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_03]: John Mayer plays guitar for the Grateful
Dead.
[SPEAKER_03]: He does.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at first I wanted to hate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I heard about this years ago,
I was like, they put that dude on guitar
[SPEAKER_03]: with the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are they doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I went and saw it and I have no
complaints.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm satisfied.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am amazed at how perfect it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is one of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've listened to him talk about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen him play it.
[SPEAKER_03]: No doubt in my mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: John Mayer is one of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So big shout out to John Mayer for making
the dead and co magical.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait to go tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to everybody that I got to dance
with in Boulder because this is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: come out on Monday.
[SPEAKER_03]: The show will already have happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope we all had a good time together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ladies and gentlemen, I would love it I
invite you to email me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, don't forget about Patreon,
patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I want to thank everybody for
listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love each and every one of my listeners,
my followers, my friends, my fans.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are all my friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you see me out somewhere, don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shake my hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me what you think.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like making new friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just as shy as you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just a normal dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Say what's up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I may have a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I may have a sticker.
[SPEAKER_03]: I may have a fucking seed pack on me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't email me later and be like,
hey, bro, I saw you at this event.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't want to say hi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, just fucking walk up and say hello.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fist bump me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: The people with me are cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might change both of our day.
[SPEAKER_03]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to meet you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to meet me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hang out to be friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I'm really rambly after the
dabs I took and all the Dr. Pepper I
[SPEAKER_03]: drank.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's time to wrap up this show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
friend Brett, also known as Mary's
[SPEAKER_03]: motivation on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: And until next time, take a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: And give your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're missing righteousness.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't shun them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if we did them come there and knock
us, knock us, knock us, then we put
[SPEAKER_01]: another fire upon them first, first.
[SPEAKER_01]: You understand, money will not love us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Signs of the time are plain to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: They reap in the fruit of their vanity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark us, we teach them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Know the price it reads them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fire is burning.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fire is burning.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fire is burning.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fire is burning.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fire is burning.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fire is burning.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fire is burning.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fire is burning.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fire is burning.
The fire is burning.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fire is burning.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fire is burning.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fire is burning.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fire is burning.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fire is burning.
