[SPEAKER_00]: Is the terrible twos kicking in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait till you get to the fucking
terrorizing threes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think two is bad, three is when it
kicks in, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to talk about kids the
whole podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to get it out of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do respect Mike for coming and taking
time away from his family.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had to walk away from that little boy
who's a handsome little fucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure he's fun to play with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, dude, it's so much fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the things that I'll tell
you, dude, being a parent is a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: My kid's 13 now and it's a totally
different kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now she can talk shit to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like troll each other a little bit and
send each other emojis of elephants
[SPEAKER_00]: farting in monkeys' faces and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fun relationship with my kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my kiddo if she ever listens
to this damn podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has no reason to listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: She doesn't care about cannabis at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough kid talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, are you okay after those dabs?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friends at Apothecary
Extracts and also my friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Elevations, the dispensary in Colorado
Springs on Razorback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I was at work and I received a text
message that there was a secret drop of
[SPEAKER_00]: some lemon jeffery high cannabinoid full
spectrum extract and also some high
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: I zipped up there after work and I bought
fucking all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friends at Elevations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't even put it on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: They waited for me to get there and I
scooped it all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a moment ago I took a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I heated the banger quite hot and I
took a dab of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dumped some THC crystals on there and
then after that I dumped way too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like half the vial.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't come out dude and then I gave
it like a little nudge and it just poured
[SPEAKER_00]: out and I was like fuck was the only thing
on my brain but I was like I'm gonna smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a dollop of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I poured a big fat dollop of high terpene
full spectrum extract onto the nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on a dabber I had some high
cannabinoid full spectrum extract also
[SPEAKER_00]: with some ambrosia and all of it was made
from lemon jeffery except the THCA was
[SPEAKER_00]: made from another strain but everything
else came from some lemon jeffery.
[SPEAKER_01]: It still smells like lemon candy in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rig still smells like lemons.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just pull through the rig and it
tastes like lemon candy without any hash
[SPEAKER_00]: on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking about the high
cannabinoid and high terpene full spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I've got some of this high
terpene full spectrum extract in my hand
[SPEAKER_00]: let's talk a little bit about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's describe this little vial of stuff
to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a half dram vial as the unit of
measure this size would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: How tall is that Mike?
[SPEAKER_00]: Without the lid?
[SPEAKER_01]: Three quarters of an inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was gonna say half an inch but it's half
to three quarters of an inch tall and the
[SPEAKER_00]: lid is almost a third of the size of the
whole bottle and it holds a gram of
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene, high terpene full cannabinoid,
full, this is hard to say, high terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: full spectrum extract in this one
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very well reasonably priced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it look like really runny honey
possibly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe thick vegetable oil or thin
vegetable oil?
[SPEAKER_01]: The runny honey is a good description.
[SPEAKER_01]: That hits the color right on the mark and
it's way too runny for actual honey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a light motor oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like some 5W30 but real nice and
clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was funny watching you try to dab it in
motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well I poured it out of that container
into a banger, a quartz banger and it
[SPEAKER_00]: puddled in there and when the dab hit my
[SPEAKER_00]: face was filled with the flavors of lemon
Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reached the maximum of flavor that your
face can take.
[SPEAKER_00]: My face was like that's such a good flavor
and then it went oh that's way too much of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen you take huge dabs before and
you don't usually fight them like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to finish the dab but I had to
keep forcing my lungs to like inhale that
[SPEAKER_00]: and they were like but dude like it's like
if you put vapor rub on the tip of your
[SPEAKER_00]: nose and then try to take a dab you're
like I'm having a hard time my lungs don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to breathe that in real heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I gave Mike a similar dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't put as many things on there
because I don't want to kill Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were shooting for a tighter more
succeed show tonight so not getting super
[SPEAKER_01]: baked was part of the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully there aren't as many rambles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully there's a little we're already
off to a rambly start but hey had to
[SPEAKER_00]: explain these dabs these dabs were
tremendous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much fun folks we're so spoiled here
you should come check out what we got
[SPEAKER_01]: going on in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah come visit Colorado take a few dabs
and then go home don't move here it's
[SPEAKER_00]: crowded everything sucks it's traffic you
don't want to live here shout out to my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends in the Mystic Roots band.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah there's a rule now if you want to
move to Colorado you have to trick someone
[SPEAKER_01]: into moving somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes two people and don't don't drive on
I-25 or I-70 promise that you won't go
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere near I-25 or I-70 because it's
already packed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to drive up to Springs today to go
pick up this hash and it should be a 45
[SPEAKER_00]: minute drive thanks to the the lovely
weather and surprise turns and shit
[SPEAKER_00]: traffic in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me closer to an hour and 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are rules that you have to be inside
the dispensary by a certain time you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to be rung up by a certain time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look like an asshole because I was
pushing the fucking limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if I didn't know what I want already
they might have been mad at me for going
[SPEAKER_00]: in there at that last very second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right they've got to be closed all the way
up by what seven?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes the last person's got to be out the
door locked up by 655 right means if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not in the building by 620 you're a
dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: 630 ish yeah I was 632 ish when I was
getting out of the car and I got a fork at
[SPEAKER_00]: five and just zipped up there so it took
me all that time to get there I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: stop for gas I didn't pee I had everything
I needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've made that drive a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah that dab is working it made me sweaty
it made me it made me very euphorically
[SPEAKER_00]: high and it made me chatty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can still taste it it's like lemon
starburst like I ate a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: lemon starburst earlier and I've just got
that wonderful little after flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the side of the lemon meringue
pie where it's a little more whipped cream
[SPEAKER_00]: and a little less lemon that's kind of the
flavor that left in my mouth I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah lemon meringue dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't have gotten my hash today if I
did not get my medical marijuana card
[SPEAKER_00]: renewed yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: No my card hasn't expired yet but
everybody in Colorado has been trained to
[SPEAKER_00]: be very proactive on getting their cards
renewed because in the past it has taken
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking 10 to 12 weeks to get your card
when you send in the paperwork it takes 12
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks to get your card back.
[SPEAKER_01]: The CDPHE the the state department that
sends them out just got hammered in the
[SPEAKER_01]: press like a month and a half two months
ago because they were backed up again and
[SPEAKER_01]: so I'm glad to see that that backlog is
gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes they're catching up I think they're
about two weeks behind right now but
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem the problem in that is so
let's say not everybody has a lot of extra
[SPEAKER_00]: money you're running out of funds you
can't go to the medical marijuana doc
[SPEAKER_00]: that's probably the bottom of several
people's list you got lights you got the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking car payment you got the rent you
got whatever food you're gonna eat this
[SPEAKER_00]: week maybe somewhere on there's the weed
doctor at the end of the month.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of telling information in
the order of those items folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got lights rent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well sometimes the lights are more
expensive than the rent in some instances.
[SPEAKER_01]: No I was that usually people list stuff in
the order of personal importance and that
[SPEAKER_01]: was just cracking me up you're like man I
can have lights outside I don't need rent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right we got sidetracked already but
dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you get your medical marijuana card
renewed at the time that it expires
[SPEAKER_00]: there's going to be a long time waiting
before your replacement card comes in and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not allowed to renew your card 30
days before it expires so if it takes 32
[SPEAKER_00]: days for that card to come in you're two
days without your medical marijuana card
[SPEAKER_00]: which means if you're growing an elevated
count or an increased count which your
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor can give you if they do choose to
do so based on your condition you are now
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal for a few days until your card
comes you cannot shop in a dispensary if
[SPEAKER_00]: you need medicine until that card comes it
fucks a lot of things up and it was uncool
[SPEAKER_00]: it was just shitty it wasn't working it
was on it wasn't organized it wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a period of time where it was
almost the backlog was almost a year yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: which in practice meant you got a free
weed card for a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at that time you were allowed to use
the temporary paperwork to shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had they had to have different rules
then now there's because of that now you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't shop with temporary paperwork now
they're like bring that purple card or get
[SPEAKER_00]: the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The new restrictions on when you can renew
and where like when you can shop if you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have your active card with you are
part of the reason that the CDPHE took
[SPEAKER_01]: heat in the press because because lots of
people need these cards to buy their
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine and if the backlog is longer than
the allowed period to do it you're
[SPEAKER_01]: screwing people badly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely and people would come into the
dispensary when I was with green and
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy I would take deliveries or I'd be
there shopping and people would come in
[SPEAKER_00]: with their paperwork like hey I've been
waiting can I shop and the bud tenders
[SPEAKER_00]: would have to say sorry you can't come in
here they don't have to turn them away and
[SPEAKER_00]: that looks like shit when you have to they
don't come back even though it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: state's rule and a rule that the
dispensaries have to follow to stay in
[SPEAKER_00]: business it pisses off the consumer
because they don't have their medicine and
[SPEAKER_00]: they have to blame it on somebody and so
they blame that dispensary that won't let
[SPEAKER_00]: them shop there and they don't come back
you lose their business because of their
[SPEAKER_00]: paperwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep so the good thing there is a positive
now I went to the medical marijuana doctor
[SPEAKER_00]: yesterday my appointment was at 120 it's
the weed docs over around three o'clock I
[SPEAKER_00]: finally saw the fucking doctor that's the
bad that's the worst part about going to
[SPEAKER_00]: the weed doctor is you make an appointment
for I made my appointment for one they
[SPEAKER_00]: sent me my reminder saying that it was at
120 I showed up at 115 and at about three
[SPEAKER_00]: o 'clock I finally saw the doc yep the
appointment took honestly five or ten
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes because I've seen this guy ten
times we have a relationship he's a bona
[SPEAKER_00]: fide we've got a bona fide relationship
he's like how's this paperwork annual yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah basically the paperwork is way
different now there are way more specific
[SPEAKER_00]: questions they ask how much cannabis you
use what type you use how you grow it how
[SPEAKER_00]: much you yield per plant how many harvests
you get per year if that's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: turned into edibles or concentrates how
many how much of that you're going to use
[SPEAKER_00]: per day per hour they ask a lot of shit
and then also there's a caregiver registry
[SPEAKER_00]: that you cannot become a caregiver now on
somebody's paperwork unless you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: caregiver registry number so if you're a
caregiver in Colorado you got to get your
[SPEAKER_00]: ass on the caregiver registry that's easy
just go to the Colorado Department of
[SPEAKER_00]: Public Health and Environment thing type
in marijuana or just google Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: caregiver registry all that shit will pop
up make it really easy to find so I did
[SPEAKER_00]: the basic paperwork and the lady behind
the counter goes you got enough of that I
[SPEAKER_00]: can finish that out for you and because
it's all just a cut and paste she typed it
[SPEAKER_00]: into the computer from there and then
filled out all the rest of the forms for
[SPEAKER_00]: me just by cutting and pasting and then I
pulled out my phone and went to a website
[SPEAKER_00]: that she gave me I created a username I
got an email I logged in through my email
[SPEAKER_00]: on my phone I created a template there was
a draft I saw the doc he approved all my
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff I took my stamped paperwork to a
desk with the lady who took my credit card
[SPEAKER_00]: and ran it through the Department of
Public Health and Public Health and
[SPEAKER_00]: Environment website charged me $16.10 for
the card swiping to the state I paid the
[SPEAKER_00]: doc a fee to get my doc visit plus my
plant count and then she turned in all my
[SPEAKER_00]: paperwork by clicking a button on the
thing and then today at one o'clock I got
[SPEAKER_00]: an email saying thank you your new card is
activated so I've got a brand new medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana card today it took less than 24
hours to have my card renewed and
[SPEAKER_00]: activated that's impressive yeah I can
print it off if I need to but some
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries will take it right off of my
phone they say they should not but some
[SPEAKER_00]: places will take it right off of my phone
I should print that out but my old one
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't expire for a month still I've got
three weeks right you were on it when I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: at the office one day at work and I think
about it I'm just gonna print that shit
[SPEAKER_01]: out and then I've got my new card yeah I
made sure that I've got a reminder set my
[SPEAKER_01]: phone for a month before my next one right
well the reason you need a month reminder
[SPEAKER_00]: now is because the docs are so busy yep it
takes a month just to get into that
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana doc especially if you
are trying to receive an extended plant
[SPEAKER_00]: count or any sort of special treatment or
anything like that a lot of people ask
[SPEAKER_00]: just because I'm I got asked this question
today I've got a friend with a child who
[SPEAKER_00]: is under the age of 18 and is experiencing
some conditions and symptoms that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: very easily treated by the use of medical
cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: the younger the the younger the patient
the more stringent it is if you've for the
[SPEAKER_01]: the really young kids coming to Colorado
it's got to be two specialists which can
[SPEAKER_01]: be incredibly difficult for a lot of
people there are two people that two
[SPEAKER_00]: places that I think may do it I just want
to make sure so I'm gonna research that
[SPEAKER_00]: after the show I'll contact them tomorrow
or something it's not too hard to just
[SPEAKER_00]: call them two local places findable
information we have ones in Springs ones
[SPEAKER_00]: in Pueblo just ask them if they've got two
docs on site should I just say the names
[SPEAKER_00]: dude I don't want to advertise but it's
helping people fuck it I'm gonna say I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna say it just to help people I don't
care these people aren't paying me you can
[SPEAKER_00]: check out relax clarity in Pueblo they may
have two doctors on site in a place called
[SPEAKER_00]: Medi Val in Colorado Springs often has two
docs on site I don't get paid for that I
[SPEAKER_00]: just want to help you guys out if you need
fucking if trying to get a kid a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana card there's no reason to
fucking hold anything back I'll share that
[SPEAKER_00]: info that's worth the fucking one kid
getting their card right one little kid
[SPEAKER_00]: not having a seizure it's worth that shit
free shout out to those places Tom Ross to
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff sent you maybe they'll fucking do
something if not whatever but getting your
[SPEAKER_00]: card is it's the process with the doc is
just as hard extended plant counts are
[SPEAKER_00]: harder if you're relying on going to the
doc for an extended plant count you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have a bona fide relationship with your
medical marijuana doctor or you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: getting your medical marijuana card from
your regular physician which is always an
[SPEAKER_00]: option if you have the balls to ask them
and you don't want to lose your paper
[SPEAKER_00]: patient-doctor relationship with some
people because some docs will drop you
[SPEAKER_00]: just for admitting that you use cannabis
or the idea so make sure you have a good
[SPEAKER_00]: doc first but if you want an extended
plank out you need paperwork you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: have some sort of proof that you've got
some sort of condition that the use of
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis would improve the quality
of your life it's got to fall on the list
[SPEAKER_00]: of qualifying conditions so but once you
get that part done getting it taken care
[SPEAKER_00]: of like registering with the state and
shit if you know how to point and click on
[SPEAKER_00]: a Facebook page you can register and get
your card done I'm thrilled they've
[SPEAKER_01]: streamlined it it takes a couple processes
were I mean it was so painfully slow I
[SPEAKER_00]: remember the first time I waited in line
in the snow outside of a building in
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver it took me about three hours to get
there because I drove in the snow and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we waited outside of the building for
about another three hours saw the doc for
[SPEAKER_00]: seriously seven seconds he goes what's
your claim to fame was what he asked he
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't say what ails you what hurts you
does what's your claim to fame and I said
[SPEAKER_00]: man my knees are fucked and he goes sit
down and he put a hand under my left thigh
[SPEAKER_00]: and he said may I touch you and I said
yeah doc and he put his hand under my left
[SPEAKER_00]: thigh and he goes move your leg up and I
moved my leg up and he goes oh that's
[SPEAKER_00]: terrible and he just went to writing that
was my first medical marijuana doctor
[SPEAKER_00]: experience he's like yes is your money
green yes sir my money's green oh I will
[SPEAKER_00]: take your money here is your card and he
handed me my paperwork and he goes the
[SPEAKER_00]: building right there at the green door is
a dispensary you get a 30% discount for
[SPEAKER_00]: shopping here today thank you have a great
day and just sent me out of the fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: way and then they give you a bundle of
papers and you have to figure out which
[SPEAKER_00]: ones to mail which ones to keep which ones
to post on your garden then you mail off
[SPEAKER_00]: shit and then you hope that this little
certified mail thing comes back and then
[SPEAKER_00]: it would finally come back it took for
fucking ever for that thing to come back
[SPEAKER_00]: it would come back and then like fucking
six or eight weeks later you'd get this
[SPEAKER_00]: crinkled up envelope from the state and
you'd open it up and it would either say
[SPEAKER_00]: oh you wrote your middle initial a little
weird it doesn't look like an M it looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like a crooked N so you don't get your
card you have to fill out all this
[SPEAKER_00]: paperwork again take it to another notary
and then send it back and we'll try again
[SPEAKER_01]: or one that used to wreck people was used
the wrong color ink yeah you could only
[SPEAKER_01]: use black ink you screw up something or
your hands shakes a little bit so you just
[SPEAKER_01]: slap a line through it and finish whatever
nope you just voided that whole page your
[SPEAKER_01]: whole application shit yeah and then
you've got to wait just three months for
[SPEAKER_01]: them to open it the two months for them to
process it the week for it to get mailed
[SPEAKER_01]: back to you to know that oh no now you've
got to start over yeah or you would get
[SPEAKER_00]: the card the mail yep or your card shows
up finally and then those cards the ink
[SPEAKER_00]: wore off of them so a lot of people were
just carrying around red cards they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like it doesn't even say my name but I
have a card the first batch was fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: flimsy as hell they used to be like $120 a
pop that was the original price now this
[SPEAKER_00]: the purple card that you got from the
state for the past few years it's purple
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's real thin and shitty plastic and
the numbers just wipe right off if you get
[SPEAKER_00]: it warm and your hand is sweaty and you'll
just take the numbers right off I I've
[SPEAKER_01]: been to two different shops that give you
a protective sleeve yeah come in and yours
[SPEAKER_01]: is unprotected because they know it's
gonna be toast in weeks and the numbers
[SPEAKER_01]: just stick to that in good shops know that
like if their customers card dies they
[SPEAKER_01]: can't let them in and out anymore right
and so yeah it's just protecting your
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to shop they give you a free
sleeve I keep my medical marijuana card
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly to shop at three specific stores
like mostly one or two stores but
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes it's two or three I like to be
able to stop and shop anywhere I'm at in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado and that helps a lot it is
completely helpful protections it provides
[SPEAKER_01]: I still really not rely on but it's
helpful it's another it's good for my
[SPEAKER_00]: mental health to have that in my back
pocket old Doug gets really it starts
[SPEAKER_00]: getting like antsy when his card expires
he's like guy we got to go get my card I
[SPEAKER_00]: need my card renewed and I'm like bro it's
legal now and he's like I just feel better
[SPEAKER_00]: with it I feel better I'm like I get you
Doug we'll go get it for you man let's do
[SPEAKER_01]: that I mean Doug's been around for a lot
of that real crazy parts of the drug war
[SPEAKER_00]: that we were just kids during he's amazed
we got to get Doug back on he's amazed
[SPEAKER_00]: that he gets to see this yeah I don't know
that he believed it would happen in his
[SPEAKER_01]: lifetime that was the fun conversation I
had all the time when I was working a
[SPEAKER_01]: sales counter in a dispensary was people
that were my parents age that were just
[SPEAKER_01]: blown away that the thing they were
talking about his teenagers finally really
[SPEAKER_01]: happened and they got to enjoy it before
they died these kids get to smoke weed and
[SPEAKER_00]: we didn't even get to do it it's totally
legal now who to thunk it I knew it was
[SPEAKER_00]: coming I saw it all right let's move
forward a little bit Mike we're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: make a tight show already 20 minutes in we
haven't even gotten really to a topic we
[SPEAKER_00]: love you guys man I feel bad for the
recreational shoppers because the
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational dispensaries are kind of
tourist traps I've gone in there they're
[SPEAKER_00]: set up completely different than medical
shops their price points are different
[SPEAKER_00]: it's all geared differently everything's
geared different
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're if you're a Colorado resident
just go get that medical marijuana cart
[SPEAKER_00]: and shop medically it'll help you out all
right I want to give a big shout out to my
[SPEAKER_00]: friend big Gare for the email that they
sent me on the last podcast that I read
[SPEAKER_00]: and also the follow-up that they sent to
me it's a really long email it's more
[SPEAKER_00]: personal and to me more than it is to the
listeners so I kept it to myself but man
[SPEAKER_00]: this person you never know who you're
talking to and you get an email from
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody and this person knows what the
fuck they're talking about when it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: to breeding they have earned my respect I
cannot wait to grow some seeds that this
[SPEAKER_00]: person has bred because they have goals
they started a breeding project with the
[SPEAKER_00]: goal in mind they've reached the outcome
they were looking for the very smart
[SPEAKER_00]: person well-spoken person Gare I'm proud
to be friends with you thanks for reaching
[SPEAKER_00]: out to me thanks for the new email and I'm
going to respond to you through email
[SPEAKER_00]: personally I just wanted to give you a
shout out here on the show it's so nice
[SPEAKER_01]: when you run into people that are good at
what they do oh he's got pride and heart
[SPEAKER_00]: he's the one that sent me the email about
breeding that we're getting away from
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding like hearty plants we're making a
bunch of pussies to put in our grow rooms
[SPEAKER_00]: the dude grows with heart dude breeds with
love dude's doing it all the way properly
[SPEAKER_00]: much love and respect to that dude for the
way he grows and breeds also I owe a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to I'm not sure if I'm supposed
to say your name the reason I don't do
[SPEAKER_00]: that is because maybe your wife listens to
the show and you're not supposed to be
[SPEAKER_00]: throwing money around I don't know I try
to respect people's privacy but somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: contributed to the patreon account
recently and they also sent me an email
[SPEAKER_00]: and they said hey I would rather send you
a lump sum instead of just doing a monthly
[SPEAKER_00]: payment on patreon I don't have a method
of doing that right now but if that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to do I'm not going to deny myself
of funding and I'm not gonna leave money
[SPEAKER_00]: on the table so I may create an account to
make that an option because the people
[SPEAKER_00]: want to throw money at you you find a way
to catch it right would it be possible to
[SPEAKER_01]: just set up a larger donation on patreon
set it up for monthly and then just cancel
[SPEAKER_00]: it after one payment you probably could
but if I just went and like that seems
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of complicated they mentioned that I
should have a venmo and they're not the
[SPEAKER_00]: first person to say that so I should just
go set up a venmo account anyway and then
[SPEAKER_00]: make it grow from your heart podcast venmo
page and then people could help us out
[SPEAKER_00]: that way also dude man I should also do
one of those Amazon links an affiliate
[SPEAKER_00]: link on Amazon but uh um I'm busy I'm
sitting here smoking fucking lemon turps
[SPEAKER_01]: all day right you've already got it how
many social media accounts to manage right
[SPEAKER_00]: and I have a full-time job everybody uh
don't they don't all know that I run the
[SPEAKER_00]: the semi-large garden that's a small
garden three rivers organics I don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to out you too much but it for a minute in
the recent past it was raining in the
[SPEAKER_00]: exact space where we record no I talked
about on that pod on the podcast a lot on
[SPEAKER_00]: the show yeah this this exact spot where
the MacBook is sitting is where the puddle
[SPEAKER_00]: of water accumulated on this table and
yeah so every time I get when Mike leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: and we get done recording the the iPad
will get peeled off the table and the
[SPEAKER_00]: MacBook will get taken to another area all
this gear gets put away to where it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: a waterproof safe place because I don't
trust this roof right now until I get it
[SPEAKER_00]: fully repaired it's patched and it's cool
for a minute but you got lucky none of the
[SPEAKER_01]: gear got too toasted but all this travel
and rearranging and repacking and
[SPEAKER_00]: restoring it's gonna add to the wear and
tear it's been a bitch and I say peel the
[SPEAKER_00]: iPad off the table you guys because it's
got so much probably stick it to the wall
[SPEAKER_01]: watch Netflix we could glue it to the wall
right now with the loose it's stuck
[SPEAKER_00]: there's too much glass around and it's an
iPad but watch I want to try to move it
[SPEAKER_00]: off of the table and see if it makes a
noise I'm gonna move the mic a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: toward it I think you guys probably heard
that that was serious sounded like that
[SPEAKER_00]: snap was coming through my headphones too
that was the hash sticking my iPad to the
[SPEAKER_00]: table so yeah that's my life you guys
where the heck are we we're thanking
[SPEAKER_00]: patreon contributors and possibly making a
venmo I think that's where we were thank
[SPEAKER_01]: you everyone that's contributed it's so
nice to have a clean microphone cover to
[SPEAKER_00]: spin on you notice that huh these are from
China they came from from Amazon and they
[SPEAKER_01]: smell like new shoes and weirdness I
remember like episode 12 where the first
[SPEAKER_01]: microphone covers were really starting to
smell like a locker room and I was so
[SPEAKER_01]: happy when we started rotating those out
every now and again but patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: contributors you're helping mount Mike's
sanitary conditions over here I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about patreon I want to move on

[SPEAKER_00]: see me and tell me dude great fucking
podcast that makes me smile all day so I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to talk about growing cannabis for at
least a couple of seconds here this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis based podcast I'm gonna talk
about something that I got into a
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation with some other people about
and then we will talk hopefully we'll read
[SPEAKER_00]: this dude sent me three emails I don't
know if he thinks I'm really gonna answer
[SPEAKER_00]: all three of them on one episode or if I'm
gonna stretch him out and tease him I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know what this dude expected sending
me three emails Chris what are you doing
[SPEAKER_01]: bro come on anyway I love it keep sending
them folks I was taking a quick step for
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris give us a second to respond to your
first three Chris slow down bro what the
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck come on bro everybody but Chris keep
you grow from your heart at hotmail.com
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris I got you blocked no I'm just
kidding I'm just playing with you man
[SPEAKER_00]: please send me more messages so I want to
talk about when you're transplanting let's
[SPEAKER_00]: say you're taking a clone from at the
large grow where I work we run clones in
[SPEAKER_00]: clone domes we put rapid rooters in a tray
we cut a clone into there dip it in what's
[SPEAKER_00]: the purple shit clone X then stick it into
the plug and then we put the dome over it
[SPEAKER_00]: for like four days five days and don't
even fucking touch it then we water them
[SPEAKER_00]: lightly as needed then we start I don't
want to go over the whole clone thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't the idea here then we get roots
eventually we're gonna fast forward to
[SPEAKER_01]: having roots fast forward to clones with
roots how much spaghetti are we talking
[SPEAKER_00]: here just enough to man it works I have
transplanted clones and plugs with just
[SPEAKER_00]: one spaghetti coming out one noodle yep
one white healthy noodle but if you got
[SPEAKER_00]: like four or five decent noodles coming
out you're ready to go you can let them go
[SPEAKER_00]: a little longer if you want them to get
like a little bit a little more than that
[SPEAKER_00]: personally but not I like to put them into
a bigger pot and I like to this is why I
[SPEAKER_00]: like to do it because at that point I will
get some sort of root inoculant a powder
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe something like great white shark
something like Azos there's cheap stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: there are like store brand products that
you can buy that are probably the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing there's mycos there's plus life if
you're gonna use plus life go light that
[SPEAKER_00]: shit's strong from veg bloom read your
labels and know what you're using there's
[SPEAKER_00]: forage but I believe forage will be
discontinued we've got about 12 bags of
[SPEAKER_00]: forage left at the big grow and we're
using them sparingly but what I like to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with these powdered root inoculants when
you take your clones out of the clone dome
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're putting them into soil so you
get your pot and I like to use a six inch
[SPEAKER_00]: net pot or something maybe a small one
gallon pot to put my clones into so that
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have to over water too much dirt
for a small plant save yourself some space
[SPEAKER_00]: save some water let that fucker get rooted
in there and get kind of kind of tight in
[SPEAKER_00]: there before you up pot it but anyway
before it goes in there put in your dirt
[SPEAKER_00]: get it packed in semi tight finger it a
little bit to make a hole for the clone
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I take that rooting powder and
just sprinkle it all over the roots just
[SPEAKER_00]: rotate the clone a little bit in your
hands and just sprinkle that powder nice
[SPEAKER_00]: dusting yeah just dust them real good and
then put that clone in there and cover it
[SPEAKER_00]: up just like normal and then when you get
them all done water it like normal like
[SPEAKER_00]: you would put some fulvic acid in there
maybe some kelp extract of some sort a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of nitrogen if you got any
other if you want to put some plus life or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you used back in the water and do
it again go for it but I really think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful to inoculate the roots at the
beginning also when you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant from that small pot to a bigger
pot do it all over again fill your pot put
[SPEAKER_00]: your fist in there process just a bigger
piece of where you see those roots on the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside and don't transplant until you see
roots on the outside of the smaller pot
[SPEAKER_00]: when you see them gathering up out there
that's when it's time to go you want it
[SPEAKER_00]: almost pushing to be like oh it's been in
there too long because that's when you put
[SPEAKER_00]: in the next pot it's gonna explode it's
gonna go oh it's time it just don't wait
[SPEAKER_00]: too long right cuz it you'll piss it off
if you wait too long but right when it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets tight then take it out and just turn
it in a circle and just sprinkle root
[SPEAKER_00]: powder whatever you're using Azos,
Micos, Great White Shark, Plus Life,
[SPEAKER_00]: Forge there's a ton of them you guys I bet
there's a ton that I don't even fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: know about just sprinkle it right on there
and then pot it just like normal and then
[SPEAKER_00]: feed it with healthy nutrients put it
under a good light put a fan on it let it
[SPEAKER_00]: get some airflow get it healthy I think a
little dusting of the roots would really
[SPEAKER_00]: improve your grow that's one small
affordable way just got to go buy and wear
[SPEAKER_00]: a mask you guys just get one if nothing
else get one of those cheap tanner masks
[SPEAKER_00]: the fucking Asian bird flu mask dust the
roots it's fucking good for your roots and
[SPEAKER_00]: good for your plants and they will
appreciate it and then feed them stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like Plus Life throughout their veg phase
in their early flower phase happy roots
[SPEAKER_00]: will help you out so um we teased Chris's
email we're 30 minutes in let's give him
[SPEAKER_00]: at least one email and then we'll see how
much time we've got maybe we'll read his
[SPEAKER_00]: other two or maybe we'll just save time
for other listeners to get emails in the
[SPEAKER_00]: show all right Chris I'm gonna pick on you
till the end of time Chris sent me an
[SPEAKER_00]: email and it goes like this I don't know
if we should have been saying his fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: name the whole time because that's not
what he signed it as maybe I'll just go
[SPEAKER_00]: put a bleep over it 37 bleeps now because
we said his name a bunch that's cool 30
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes in I can edit the shit out of this
sorry dude just everybody be cool with it
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah it's not the name I said I was saying
his fake name the whole time the email
[SPEAKER_00]: goes like this hey Rasta Jeff I'm hitting
you with a few questions in a row tonight
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hoping you could talk about your
methods for taking down a plant to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: those turps loud do you do a dark cycle
pre chop dry trim or wet trim we would
[SPEAKER_00]: love to hear how you do it big fan of the
show I've been a listener for about a year
[SPEAKER_00]: and a half now you definitely make my mind
numbing 50 plus hour work week plus hour a
[SPEAKER_00]: week day job a lot better sorry that was
hard to read big thanks for putting out a
[SPEAKER_00]: quality podcast and helping people learn
something and have a laugh while listening
[SPEAKER_00]: much thanks sincerely so his question was
can we give him any tips on keeping the
[SPEAKER_00]: turps loud at harvest time let me start by
saying most definitely can yes I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: tips on all day the first tip is a little
advice that light destroys turpinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly so dark is always good for your
turps keep the lights a little bit away I
[SPEAKER_01]: loved that part of the question yes the
question was do you do a light site a dark
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle before you harvest so yes if you
were going just for loud turps yes that
[SPEAKER_00]: will help you out it will also in my
opinion add to density don't put them in
[SPEAKER_00]: the dark cycle when they're super wet if
you're gonna put them in the dark let them
[SPEAKER_00]: get not dry but don't put them in there
when they're soggy because dark and soggy
[SPEAKER_00]: is never a good thing that will could lead
to problems I'll let them get a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: dry before you put them in the dark yes
light does like I said light does kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: kill the turps so they are producing more
turps the turps are getting louder like
[SPEAKER_00]: you asked they're getting richer and
stronger they're developing more in the
[SPEAKER_00]: dark phase so if you do cut them down in a
dark phase there will be more turpines
[SPEAKER_00]: present in your trichomes in your plants
in your flowers in your concentrates so a
[SPEAKER_00]: dark phase is always good I like to get it
a little bit cold toward the end that
[SPEAKER_00]: makes them dense up a little bit also make
some purple I think it kind of makes them
[SPEAKER_00]: panic make sure you flush I think you say
something about that in another email so
[SPEAKER_00]: also the less you touch those plants the
better cut them down you ask wet or dry
[SPEAKER_00]: trim I prefer a dry trim cut them down
hang them upside down touch them very
[SPEAKER_00]: little okay let me back up a step flush
cut off all the fan leaves flush is so
[SPEAKER_00]: important he's got another email about
that so we're just gonna do that one next
[SPEAKER_00]: but flush cut off all the fan leaves when
they start getting close to the harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: time then put them in the dark without
those big fan leaves on there let them sit
[SPEAKER_00]: for 24 to 48 hours in the dark cut them
down hang them upside down until the stems
[SPEAKER_00]: begin to pop and from there you have to
listen to the dry and cure episodes
[SPEAKER_00]: because now you're drying and curing more
than harvesting but that's where you get
[SPEAKER_00]: it that's where it starts then you have to
let it dry until the sticks pop then you
[SPEAKER_00]: cut the buds off of the sticks into a
container and seal that container and burp
[SPEAKER_00]: it appropriately until the moisture is
gone I like to make it go really slowly if
[SPEAKER_00]: possible in Colorado weed dries really
quickly it's hard to go slow here you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get chlorophyll out and keep
terpenoids in so you want to keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: right temperatures and you want to keep
light away from it try to keep it semi
[SPEAKER_00]: cool around 72 degrees 74 degrees is
probably right around where you want it
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe 77 don't go too high heat destroys
turps light destroys turps so dry and cure
[SPEAKER_00]: it properly handle it properly don't touch
it plastic will start causing problems if
[SPEAKER_00]: you can keep it in glass containers that's
recommended what else can we recommend you
[SPEAKER_00]: dry trimming never use a trim machine I'm
gonna get off on a side rant I fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: hate trim machines the cannabis industry
hates trim machines the only people that
[SPEAKER_00]: like trim machines are greedy growers and
grow facility owners that want to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of money trim machines mangle buds in
my opinion this is all my opinion I could
[SPEAKER_01]: be fucking wrong I've yet to see one that
does what it's supposed to without a
[SPEAKER_00]: serious detriment to the final product and
another thing that a trim machine will
[SPEAKER_00]: never do I had a trimmer today find issues
in buds if those buds got pulled aside
[SPEAKER_00]: they will never make it to the public that
whole plant got re-inspected because there
[SPEAKER_00]: was one small issue in one small area that
part got segregated and counted as waste
[SPEAKER_00]: and destroyed the rest of the plant was
okay I deemed I would smoke it I would
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke that myself so it got passed on and
trimmed and taken care of a machine would
[SPEAKER_00]: have never seen that and that shit would
have rolled down the line and got put into
[SPEAKER_00]: either our hash or our pipe or a jar to
get sold and it would have embarrassed us
[SPEAKER_00]: you cannot put a value on that quality
control that a good well-trained educated
[SPEAKER_01]: trimmer brings to the table I mean when
you say don't touch it I've been trimming
[SPEAKER_01]: with people and you look over and their
glove is just solid right that means
[SPEAKER_01]: you're manhandling your fuck out of my
book half of what I grew is now on your
[SPEAKER_00]: glove yeah there's a stick on there just
handle that stick yep yeah find yourself a
[SPEAKER_00]: stick to handle and don't manhandle the
buds I think we kind of answered that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna have I would recommend you
listening to the drying and curing episode
[SPEAKER_00]: also but for the most part that's where
the harvest turps come in you cut it down
[SPEAKER_00]: in the dark you keep it dark cut it down
keep it in the dark dry it really slowly
[SPEAKER_00]: when the sticks pop then you cut the buds
off the sticks put them into a glass
[SPEAKER_00]: container and burp them I start I'm I've
got OCD I like to burp it at four hours
[SPEAKER_00]: tumble them around a little bit get air in
there because they're gonna be a little
[SPEAKER_00]: damp you might want to pull them apart put
them back in the jar close it up burp them
[SPEAKER_00]: at eight hours do it again at 16 and start
doing it like every 12 hour do it eight
[SPEAKER_00]: four eight and then 12 so doing every 12
hours before when you wake up before you
[SPEAKER_00]: go to bed every day burp these buds give
them 15 20 maybe 30 minutes open you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not trying to dry them you're trying to
let moisture escape the bud but you want
[SPEAKER_00]: so when you close that jar a reaction
happens there's oxygen and moisture and
[SPEAKER_00]: darkness and those create the perfect
moisture in there to dry slowly to pull
[SPEAKER_00]: out that chlorophyll chlorophyll is what
gives you the rough harsh taste turps are
[SPEAKER_01]: what give you that sweet delicious taste
that burnt green yeah flavor yeah that's
[SPEAKER_00]: why uh that's why rosin always tastes like
burnt popcorn if you overheat it and press
[SPEAKER_00]: it too hard you're just burning the turps
right there so there's more to this email
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm opening up my phone because it locked
here we go he goes on to say um my phone
[SPEAKER_00]: is making noise into the mixing equipment

[SPEAKER_00]: the mission statement I'm a filthy
comedian inside I try to keep it at bay on
[SPEAKER_00]: the show and I love to grow cannabis so
I'm glad that you noticed that dude thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you for the email I'm gonna email you

that's always nice thank you everybody for
[SPEAKER_01]: as baked as we got people really enjoyed
it it's it got so much feedback today when
[SPEAKER_01]: we were like let's not get so baked and do
a tighter show but my first thought was
[SPEAKER_01]: like but everybody loved our super baked
show there's one point in the show when I
[SPEAKER_00]: think I purposefully paused to edit and
when I listened to back I didn't even edit
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was like right here I need to edit
the show is why I paused at one point I
[SPEAKER_00]: was like and here we go with the podcast
and fucking I didn't edit that at all I
[SPEAKER_00]: was listening back and then my friend
Elijah's like I don't think you did that
[SPEAKER_01]: right and I was like oops we recorded it
like we meant to hit record it like 930 we
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't actually end up recording until at
well after 10 the video was or the the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast was posted at midnight and by 4 a
.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was getting tweets and messages about
how good the show was nice like it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: quick turnaround on that one that's fun
when you post it and people listen as it
[SPEAKER_00]: goes up yep when the alert comes up on
your phone we've got an awesome little
[SPEAKER_00]: community you've built all right do we
want to read the next one from the message
[SPEAKER_00]: goes like this I'm gonna read two because
I said his fucking full name on the show
[SPEAKER_00]: and we may have to edit a few minutes out
anyway so it goes like this hey Rasta Jeff
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a question about flushing in cocoa
do it that's my advice do you do just
[SPEAKER_00]: plain water plus a flushing additive or do
you water with a small amount of cow mag
[SPEAKER_00]: added in because of your cocoa I heard
that was given as advice also wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: hear your thoughts on behind unph water
flush or phing your flush in cocoa as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as soil like a pro mix all right there's a
couple of things to touch on their
[SPEAKER_00]: flushing in cocoa do you add just before I
go that far I want to ask and I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: address this are you flushing just at the
end of flower because some people think
[SPEAKER_00]: that they need to flush their cocoa during
the flowering cycle which I find
[SPEAKER_00]: unnecessary when I'm watering with cocoa
and I'm growing with cocoa I add nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: to every single watering when I'm growing
with cocoa some people feel the need at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of week three to just run so much
clean water through it and flush out the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients I don't feel the need to do that
I like to have it in there cocoa has a low
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say this wrong because I'm
full of shit there's a low cation exchange
[SPEAKER_01]: shit doesn't bind to cocoa I was thinking
for the slightly more scientific term for
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't hold the nutrients as well as
dirt right you're not getting that same
[SPEAKER_00]: salt built it doesn't live like the dirt
does it's it's real slick and it's oily
[SPEAKER_00]: and the nutrients and the salts will slide
right off of it essentially it's more like
[SPEAKER_00]: a sponge that will hold stuff by design
all out of and that's the idea so we're
[SPEAKER_00]: more able to feed more consistently so
when I'm talking about flushing I am only
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about the final phase of flowering
when you were trying to get the nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: out just before harvest right at DNA and
and soil or cocoa I don't recommend a mid
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle flush of any type unless you're
seeing a problem and then if I do that I
[SPEAKER_00]: mix up a very specific batch of nutrients
that I use and I flush every plant heavily
[SPEAKER_00]: with that until water is running out and
then I know that most of the old nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: are out and what's in there now is this
mix that I trust and I know that's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: make my plants happy that's what I put in
there to fix a problem so now when I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about flushing I'm gonna go to
just the end of flowering right now is
[SPEAKER_01]: what I'm talking about Mike you look like
you want to jump in I was gonna ask are
[SPEAKER_01]: you do you recommend just watering the
normal volume of water with clean or clean
[SPEAKER_01]: pH water or do you like to I think if it
is flooding the plant we're like say
[SPEAKER_01]: you're gonna start flush today the plant
gets six or eight or ten times its normal
[SPEAKER_01]: volume of water to kind of just force
everything out it would be ideal to know
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly how much you can put through and
what it takes but there are several ways
[SPEAKER_00]: to do it depending on your environment and
you're in your situation and your time
[SPEAKER_00]: frame let me write down something with my
pen here which is funny because I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: writing down the word pen let me write a
note to kind of get back to what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: asking but then I want to kind of read the
email because you've got a side question
[SPEAKER_00]: that's gonna kind of put me onto that yeah
do you add do you flush with just plain
[SPEAKER_00]: water or a flushing additive you can do a
flushing additive if you want if you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to speed up the process if you only have
seven days to flush put a flushing
[SPEAKER_00]: additive in there in the first day if
you've got ten days of flush consider the
[SPEAKER_00]: flushing additive if you've got 12 to 14
days it's not necessary what a flushing
[SPEAKER_00]: additive does it sugars when you add the
sugars to the water and pour it through
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow medium sugars will help release
bonded salts is basically what happens
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not a hundred percent what goes on
there but the sugars will help release
[SPEAKER_00]: bonded salts in your rhizosphere which
will help flush your plants and help speed
[SPEAKER_00]: up the metabolism of your plants that's
the part why you would use that it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary but it's helpful and if you've
got it go for it so just plain water works
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you say would you water with a
small amount of cal mag added in because
[SPEAKER_00]: of the cocoa no I if I'm flushing this is
why I wasn't sure if you meant flushing at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end or like at the end of week three
and five or something like that no if I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: flushing I'm flushing I want it gone I
don't want anything in there unless I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: using veg bloom I will go until the last
five or seven days with some shine but I
[SPEAKER_00]: never said that out loud check out veg
bloom tech on Instagram for all the
[SPEAKER_00]: details on how to use shine properly
because it's a great product they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: pay me to say that but it helps I don't
put anything in there at the end of flush
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm flushing I want it all to go bye bye
um also I want to hear your thoughts
[SPEAKER_00]: behind unph or ph water during your flush
if you can ph it if you've got the ability
[SPEAKER_00]: why not do it if you are flushing an
outdoor plant that you've got a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon fucking smart pot outside just put
the hose on there and let it run dude
[SPEAKER_00]: don't even try to ph that shit it's gonna
take so much ph down you may not have a
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir to do it it's outside you'll be
okay you don't have to pee they're done
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing too bad is gonna happen but if you
can ph it do it why not in some places
[SPEAKER_01]: that's gonna be crazy important depending
on your water that is true if your water
[SPEAKER_00]: is completely fucking funky you are going
to need to ph it if you've got we're very
[SPEAKER_00]: lucky here our water kind of tastes like
shit it's got a weird flavor but if you
[SPEAKER_00]: test it it's really not that bad the ppms
are low the ph is all right it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: not that bad so you can flush with water
from here I don't know where you are a guy
[SPEAKER_00]: whose name I keep fucking up and shouldn't
say that I almost said again I don't I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know if you can you if you got well
water I don't know what you're using you
[SPEAKER_00]: might want to ph that but let me recap and
make sure I got all your stuff before I go
[SPEAKER_00]: on to the part that Mike made me write
down with my brain plain water flushing
[SPEAKER_00]: additive if you're in a hurry but make
sure if you use that flushing additive
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure you get at least one clean water
rinse after that so that your flushing
[SPEAKER_00]: additive isn't what you taste no I don't
use cow mag in my flush the only thing I
[SPEAKER_00]: would consider using during my flush would
probably be shine from our friends at veg
[SPEAKER_00]: bloom also known as hydroponic research ph
it if you can it's not necessary also
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to know it may not be necessary
sorry I don't want to mislead you it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary for me wanted to know my
thoughts behind unph water and flush in
[SPEAKER_00]: soil as well soil is much more forgiving
if you've got decent water you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: want to run a lot more water through your
soil than your cocoa to flush that out
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gonna be a lot harder to get
everything out in the soil than it will
[SPEAKER_00]: the cocoa but it depends on how much
you're using honestly if you want to ph it
[SPEAKER_00]: or not if you're going if you've got a big
outdoor fucking grow you might just want
[SPEAKER_00]: to run the hose so I wrote down something
here flushing either in cocoa or soilless
[SPEAKER_00]: mix or however you want to grow one thing
you can do elevate your pot off of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground maybe use or put a tray under this
would work to put a tray under it just a
[SPEAKER_00]: little saucer catch the water that's
coming out of it is my point clean your
[SPEAKER_00]: vessel set the pot on a vessel of some
sort that is going to catch the water you
[SPEAKER_00]: need like a half inch of water maybe an
inch of water coming out of the bottom of
[SPEAKER_00]: your pot flush it flush it flush it until
it's draining a lot until you see a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of water coming out go hard then catch
some of that water and stick an EC pin in
[SPEAKER_00]: there stick a PPM pin in there and see how
much shit's coming out of the bottom of
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant see how low you can get it if
you're in cocoa you can get it really low
[SPEAKER_00]: and soil it's gonna stay up kind of higher
just because there's stuff in the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got natural stuff in your soil
you're not getting it all out till you
[SPEAKER_00]: rinse out all the soil right see how you
see how low you can get it in that cocoa
[SPEAKER_00]: you should be able to get it fairly low
maybe maybe test the cocoa when you get it
[SPEAKER_00]: run some water through it see what an EC
is at before you put nutrients in it try
[SPEAKER_00]: to get it back to there before you flush I
don't know if you can this is all an idea
[SPEAKER_00]: but I know what I don't want to say and
I'm trying to think an arbitrary number
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't want to give you a number of
what my ECs come out at the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: week when we test we test every day when
we water and my girl we catch the water
[SPEAKER_00]: every table gets water that gets the EC
tested the pH tested it should be in a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain range but I don't know what you're
feeding I don't know what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting in I don't want to give you a
fake a false hope or a fake guideline so
[SPEAKER_00]: see what you see how low you can get it in
your cocoa see how much you can flush that
[SPEAKER_00]: shit out and see how low you can get so
you got to go get a P EC meter or a PPM
[SPEAKER_00]: pen and see how low you can get it it's
all about the right tools yeah so that's
[SPEAKER_00]: my advice on flushing in just about any
medium if you're using Rockwool or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever else type of hydro stuff like
that flush you can flush about 10 to 14
[SPEAKER_00]: days 7 is maybe enough if you use some
sort of product and you go really fast and
[SPEAKER_00]: I but I like 10 to 14 days all right this
next question should be pretty quick but I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to proofread it so he says hey I was
just laughing to myself saying the dang
[SPEAKER_00]: team was giving your strains a name that
they made up I definitely don't agree with
[SPEAKER_00]: them doing that for reasons you stated on
the show but I'd love to hear even in a p
[SPEAKER_00]: .m.
[SPEAKER_00]: what names they added so it turns out one
of them was called depth charge which was
[SPEAKER_00]: not my seeds it was another brand and then
the other one that they just put a label
[SPEAKER_00]: on was they just called it ire and it was
the lemon Jeffrey to arise they just
[SPEAKER_00]: slapped the name on it and called it ire
which if they're gonna call it anything I
[SPEAKER_00]: guess ire is okay but there are other
strains out there called ire another
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder used the name ire OG but yeah I
that's all they did they just called it
[SPEAKER_00]: ire so answer all three of your emails
since I kept saying you're a real name on
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast hopefully let me leave that in
so that I don't have to edit too much it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just getting the habit of saying every
email is from Rusty Shackleford yeah if
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys when you email me which you can
do it grow from your heart at hotmail.com
[SPEAKER_01]: that should be like instead of hi Rasta
Jeff it should just be bold letters you
[SPEAKER_01]: can or you cannot use my name on the show
there you go start your email with what's
[SPEAKER_00]: up Rasta Jeff do or do not say my name on
the podcast or just yeah because that
[SPEAKER_00]: would help me out I apologize and if I
busted you out before anybody else sorry
[SPEAKER_01]: dude keep sending emails that we
absolutely love the questions yes send the
[SPEAKER_00]: emails to grow from your heart at a
hotmail.com I would love to hear from you
[SPEAKER_00]: I love answering listener emails because
that lets me know that I'm actually doing
[SPEAKER_00]: something for at least one person yep
you're not just rambling over here to Mike
[SPEAKER_00]: being all high did they like it when we
ramble Mike those dabs are wearing off you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to wrap up a podcast and take couple
of dabs thinking exactly the same thing we
[SPEAKER_01]: should high five wrap this show up and
