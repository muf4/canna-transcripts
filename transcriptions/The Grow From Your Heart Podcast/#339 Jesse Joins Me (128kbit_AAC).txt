[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode 339 of the Grow From
Your Heart Podcast, your source for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_01]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who is
[SPEAKER_01]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, this episode of the
podcast is brought to you by our friends
[SPEAKER_01]: at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_01]: Company, and you can find them at dankseed
.store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, in this episode of
the podcast, I'm joined by our friend
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse, and we sit down to talk about
indoor growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about commercial growing,
and then we hung out and had a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I like to start the show off by
letting you know what I'm dabbing on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, we took dabs of orange earth nectar
from our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super delicious concentrate put me in a
really good mood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, with no further ado,
let's get right to the podcast with Jesse
[SPEAKER_01]: and myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are here live with Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a long time, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: How things been?
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been a very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things have been pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been loving your pictures,
your Mexico pictures, your garden pictures
[SPEAKER_01]: from other places.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are very entertaining to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congrats on the adventures and on the
anniversary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's just four years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the wife for letting me come
play for a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been hanging out bullshit and we
took a bunch of dabs, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll have to excuse the slowness that
will wear off eventually, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as soon as it does, we're going
to take more dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wanted to bring Jesse on because
somebody asked me a very interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: question and I tried to politely not laugh
at them when they asked.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it kind of made me giggle a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a lot of things that I was
like, oh, this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I thought I'd talk about on the show
with Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody asked me, why is it so hard to
grow indoors when it just happens
[SPEAKER_01]: naturally outdoors?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that sparked a lot of thoughts in my
head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse looks like he's already got stuff to
say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it go, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like you want to launch something
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, it's been so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot how to podcast for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing is easier to grow inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to recreate a natural
environment and even in a harsh
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, it's still a harsh outdoor
desert environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why I'm assuming desert,
but it's still going to be harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I trying to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even that is more loving to a plant than a
rough indoor environment that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: getting fresh air, has hot lights being
down on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing I really thought you were going
to laugh at is that they actually thought
[SPEAKER_01]: it was easy to grow outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people think we can just throw a
seed out there and pour some water on it
[SPEAKER_01]: and hope that we have good buds at the end
of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand the notion though that it is
a little easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not trying to balance environmental
differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, still definitely not easy unless
you live somewhere where it rains about an
[SPEAKER_00]: inch a week on time and then it dries out
in the fall and you don't have any
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity and you have dark, deep,
beautiful soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say Hawaii is about the
only place for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're going to grow outdoors,
we've got to be out there every morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to supply water if there's not
water being supplied.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to put water on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to protect it from the elements if
we don't have some sort of cover out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to prevent bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to do all of the maintenance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not as easy as a lot of people would
like to think it is to grow outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, everything you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your arms are huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're fucking sun burnt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your hat's got a sweat line on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are a physical description,
a depiction of what an outdoor grower
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel that I've definitely stepped it up
to, I proudly call myself a farmer now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got that farmer tan going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as easy to grow outdoors as some
people would like to think.
[SPEAKER_01]: When our friend said, why is it so easy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is it so hard to grow outdoors?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is it so hard indoors when it happens
so easily outdoors?
[SPEAKER_01]: My first thing was like, oh, this dude
thinks it's easy to grow outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad he didn't say that in front of
Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that easy to grow outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to dig holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to put, or at least fill giant
pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got plants out there in the heat,
which means they're thirsty, which means
[SPEAKER_01]: you're out there in the heat giving them a
drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting sweaty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're hauling water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're tending irrigation systems,
whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Top dressing plants, mix and feed,
however you do your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thinning of the plants throughout the
season, topping, trellising.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the work is identical to what you
do inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's outdoors in the damn heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you've got elements to deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's going to rain this morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's going to rain late tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been straight up hail season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a few farms, vegetable and
cannabis completely wiped out this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just completely fucking wiped out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing left.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also powdery mildew season outdoors
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is hot as shit during the day and moist
as shit at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is beautifully conditioned for powdery
mildew right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my first side of the coin is it is
really not that easy to grow outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the light is free, but the heat is
excessive and you have to water and you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to go out there and do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be out there in the heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as easy as one might think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's talk about why indoors is such a
challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to bring all of that stuff
outside into a room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just say most people are going to
pick a bedroom in their house,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably a basement, maybe an attic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the classic places you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've chosen a bedroom, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang up a couple of lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always the first step, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang up a couple of lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: You plug them in.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the first thing that's going to
happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets hot as hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets hot as hell in that room.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to run up to 90, 110 degrees
pretty quickly if you got a thousand watt
[SPEAKER_01]: light going on in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is zero air exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zero air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we got to get some air out and some
air in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the plants want, but now we're
heating it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the plants are just roasting in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we've just created basically a little
oven.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just putting Auschwitz plants in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you've got to either put cooling or
some sort of airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're adding another piece of
equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say we decided to put a blower in
there to remove some of that air and pull
[SPEAKER_01]: in some fresh air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it stinks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you've got to add a carbon filter
because that air is blowing out to the
[SPEAKER_01]: neighbors.
[SPEAKER_01]: The neighbors are going to smell your
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's still not cooling enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we need to add an air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time you start adding something,
the power is going to need to be more
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're going to need to upgrade the
power.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's not so easy indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time you add one element,
you're going to add heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to add something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we've got lights in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some air conditioning going.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a little bit of a blower.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going to happen the first time we
water those plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Humidity is going to spike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humidity is going to go crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we've got to add a dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that dehumidifier... Wait,
where'd this water come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we've got to figure out where to get
all this water.
[SPEAKER_01]: We spilled some of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's it going to go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's it going to go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a floor drain?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it's going to become humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants are going to suck up a lot of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to spill some on the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to run out of the bottom of
the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a floor drain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a bunch of saucers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to be shop vacing that out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are you going to dump the shop vac?
[SPEAKER_01]: Outside, you just pour water on those
motherfuckers in the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does its thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nature makes it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I can definitely see why
someone would think growing outdoors is
[SPEAKER_00]: easier than indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: As an indoor grower, I totally feel that
it is a struggle the whole entire season
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoors because it's so unpredictable for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: As an outdoor grower, you have the same
vibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wake up and you walk out there and go,
what the fuck went wrong overnight?
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally we get pretty good rains in the
spring and we did not get those this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of July has been just incredibly
fucking hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went six weeks without any noticeable
moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here recently, hell storms and
Colorado-style monsoon storms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sideways rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, flooding out your field,
knocking down plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're at the wind of Mother Nature,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're trying to mimic that Mother
Nature indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we added a dehumidifier and water.
[SPEAKER_01]: That dehumidifier is going to make heat
crank up the air conditioner a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate those damn things.
[SPEAKER_01]: That air conditioner is going to make
condensation dripping out of the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also the dehumidifier making more water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we've got to get rid of more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the old joke about the
humidifier and the dehumidifier side by
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eat the mic, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eat the mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just got that low sexy voice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you disappear into the recording
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the old joke about putting a
dehumidifier and a humidifier side by
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's going to win?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's basically what we're doing in a
grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my dry and cure room, I will put a
humidifier and a dehumidifier on opposite
[SPEAKER_01]: ends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll set them both at 50%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will watch them fight each other all
day long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't turn either one of them off all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get that butt at that nice
squish technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: It blows people's mind that people in
climates as dry as ours put humidifiers.
[SPEAKER_01]: People on the East Coast are like,
what's a dehumidifier or a humidifier?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you have one of those?
[SPEAKER_01]: Our rooms are so thick that we can't even
get the plants to dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually talking with an employee at
work the other day about how I would
[SPEAKER_00]: rather grow in a drier climate when it
comes to drying than a wet climate,
[SPEAKER_00]: which humidity spikes here this last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our crop took longer to dry out than
normal, and there was not much we could do
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just made me think, fuck man,
how do they do that in Humboldt or
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere on the West Coast, Maine,
down in the swamp, Florida, where they
[SPEAKER_00]: have humidity?
[SPEAKER_00]: How the fuck do you guys dry your butt
out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well also, you don't ever hear about the
Florida crunch or the California crunch,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you do hear the phrase Colorado crunch
when they talk about our weed a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it will get crispy here very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most growers around here, or let's say
most shops around here, especially a few
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago, no one knew how to dry their
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some shops that know how to do
it right, but here recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: We quickly went from a bunch of dudes
growing in our basements, taking it to the
[SPEAKER_01]: store to sell it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we bought some bigger buildings
and kind of put a couple more air
[SPEAKER_01]: conditioners than usual.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't know how to commercially scale
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it came to cut down all that
product, we still didn't know what we were
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it the same way we did it in the
basement back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to scramble and figure out how
do I dry 50 pounds of herb at one time in
[SPEAKER_01]: this big old building?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we had this giant room that we didn't
know how to control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an industry, we've taught ourselves how
to do so much stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty fucking amazing,
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've come a long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've shot ourselves in the foot a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tripped over our own dicks quite a bit
for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I feel like we have come a long way in
this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We spent way too much money on nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Way too much money on the wrong HVAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen that so many times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the HVAC companies had a meeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, so when the growers come
to us, sell them this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just sell them this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in a couple of months,
we'll come in and we'll go, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, that other company, whoever gets the
sale, we'll just blame you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll come in and we'll go, oh,
no, those guys are fucking retarded.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need this equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we'll sell them that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in about eight months,
Bill, Bill, do you want this sale?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, Bill, in about eight months,
you come in and you just throw a wrench in
[SPEAKER_01]: all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you tell them, oh, no, it all failed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to replace all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll just use all three of our
techs to install it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll never notice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that they did something.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some sort of a scam because HVAC
is the biggest fucking joke in the
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial growing industry right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of electricians are running
the same scam too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, here in this town,
they're all the same business.
[SPEAKER_01]: HVAC and electric are pretty much the same
damn companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the guys, it's such a small hiring
pool that if they fire Bill from A&B,
[SPEAKER_01]: he goes and works at C&D the next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you see him like, you guys fired
A&B because they're idiots.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now they brought this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got hired at the other place that you
hired.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you're like, oh, you brought the
idiots back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of how growers in this state go
to now that you mention it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A long time ago, I wrote down that we
should talk about why growers bounce from
[SPEAKER_01]: facility to facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man, that's a trilogy book right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the most diplomatic way we could
speak about it is just growers and owners
[SPEAKER_01]: have a different approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The owners.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's usually an investor and an
owner and then a lead grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's also a metric manager
who's got to make sure all the rules are
[SPEAKER_01]: for a compliance person, metric person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure all the rules are followed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're kind of the referee because they
know the grower wants to be fucking gung
[SPEAKER_01]: ho because we used to grow in the
basement, didn't care about the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just want to cut as many clones as we
can and not write it down and do whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that compliance person is like,
hey, write down all the clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, the dynamic usually goes an owner
and an investor.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got together and they wrote a
business plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this guy gave this guy money.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this guy that's got the money just has
ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't know how to grow a moat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually they kind of have a vague idea,
enough of an idea to fuck everything up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually about how much they know how
to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse's keeping his mouth shut because
he's got a job in the industry right now
[SPEAKER_01]: and he would like to keep it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I see him nodding and smiling
occasionally, but he's going to keep his
[SPEAKER_01]: mouth out of this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's business people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's business people, but they don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got a grower like Jesse
and I who, when we look at the plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's some love to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like something inside of us tingles when
we see a happy fucking row of plants just
[SPEAKER_01]: praying, all trellised out beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all started doing this a long time ago
when money wasn't really the main
[SPEAKER_00]: motivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've risked our families, our freedom,
our rights for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: These other people came in after the rules
changed and they're not risking,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, they're risking their money,
but that's basically what they're risking
[SPEAKER_01]: is their financial future.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wrote business plans based on current
trends and a lot of stuff has happened
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, some people may have seen
the majority of people didn't see it
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've seen business plans written
on selling pounds for $3,500.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the average grow, you know,
selling somewhere between like six and a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of those pounds going somewhere
around eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that, you know, there's a hefty
tax in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You include payroll and, you know,
I mean, and yeah, so it leads to a messed
[SPEAKER_00]: up situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people in different States just
took a giant shit in their car or their
[SPEAKER_01]: cubicle or wherever they're listening to
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did say 600 to a thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: A pound for top shelf indoor or at least
high quality greenhouse hand trimmed
[SPEAKER_01]: product that Jesse and I would smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: If he drops them on the table,
we'd grind it up and we fucking smoke a
[SPEAKER_01]: fatty of it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quality product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going for $600 to a thousand dollars
a pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Commercially.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not person to person.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, this is in wholesale bulk orders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we won't talk about how many,
but you got a lot of them that's going and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're paying all at once and they're
paying 600 to a thousand dollars a pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people, uh, I'd say three years ago,
weed was $3,200 a pound about three years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a lot of those business plans got
written on 2,500 a pound, which was,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that was the normal for quite a
while for, I never saw it going less than
[SPEAKER_01]: 2000.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always say 2000 because once you go down
less than 2000 on a home grower scale,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's when you, you don't, it's not
really worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not worth it for the home grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why everybody in Colorado,
basically all the cash droppers they gave
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: We now, if you're a cash crop and it's
going somewhere else, which I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: condone promote support, but that shit
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the only way it's worth anything
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you live in one of these States
that, you know, is building a program and
[SPEAKER_00]: going through this and you don't think
this is going to happen to you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you are wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it will happen and it's going to go
even lower and businesses that can't adapt
[SPEAKER_00]: a large scale indoor places that have 20,
$30,000 a month electric bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they're, they're not going to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, you, that's the challenge of being a
head grower right now is learning to adapt
[SPEAKER_00]: and to grow a quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same amount of it for cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The exact same thing is big ag on a large
scale and do it over and over again on a
[SPEAKER_01]: schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Predictable results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never have a room empty for more than 12
hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you're cleaning it and
getting it ready, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But by the time you come in for the next
shift, start putting plants in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to wrap up the part I was
talking about why we jump around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because basically that investor wanted his
money returned yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: That owner told that investor we'd have
money in nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: The grower told the owner we'll have a
crop in 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now there's all this bullshit that has
to be played.
[SPEAKER_01]: The owner says, well, I want it in 10
weeks then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the investor says, well,
then I want it in eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the grower has to say, but it's still
going to take 12 weeks to grow these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it gets weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they want you to cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll cut off a week on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: On each end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, what doesn't,
you can't cut off a week of edge and a
[SPEAKER_01]: week of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then, then you don't have the harvest
weight that you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you have to have these weird
arguments with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're like, why didn't you hit
the weight you wanted?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you cut me off two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it tastes funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why does it taste funny?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I didn't get to flush for the week
because you decided we're going to cut it
[SPEAKER_01]: down a week early.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, and odds are this guy,
I used to work for this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think his name's Dave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, odds are, uh, he forced you to wet
trim too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that has happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's why I see Jesse
understands exactly where we're forced to
[SPEAKER_01]: do things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: We come to it with heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come to it with dollar signs in their
eyes and it just doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta put away, you gotta grow from
your heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the name of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if you're too, if you're a bit too
busy thinking about money when you're in
[SPEAKER_01]: the grow, you're contaminating the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're mad at your girlfriend,
when you're in the grow, you're
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminating the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're thinking about porn,
when you're in the grow, some of us might
[SPEAKER_01]: be on accident, you're contaminating the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're thinking about what you're going
to name that cross, you made, you're
[SPEAKER_01]: probably fucking with the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Focus, pay attention to what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel the vibe of the plants, be in a good
mood, put some music on, dance around,
[SPEAKER_01]: feel the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get that vibe going in the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's much better than dollar signs,
dollar signs, dollar signs.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point in the market, if you're
looking to make money, do invest in
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are cannabis, there are a million
different better ways to make money.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you insist on being part of the
cannabis movement and you're not already
[SPEAKER_01]: in the Colorado market, invest in possibly
an ancillary market, but that's already
[SPEAKER_01]: filling up also.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got these Q-tips on the table from
Hemprico.
[SPEAKER_01]: They cover us with all the rig cleaning
supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you can make something like a
company like that that sells us the Q-tips
[SPEAKER_01]: and the alcohol swab Q-tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you can make glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you can open up a head shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you can open up a grow store.
[SPEAKER_00]: A company that buys waste product from all
the grows and takes it and turns it into
[SPEAKER_00]: an amazing compost and resells it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grows in the cities have huge problems
with people breaking into their trash cans
[SPEAKER_00]: to steal their waste, even though it's not
worth shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They steal the pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably actually charge the
grows to take away the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're making money two ways there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, another business that kills it,
we have a company that delivers compressed
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have CO2 tanks outside of the back of
the building, giant CO2 tanks,
[SPEAKER_01]: like six or twelve of them, depending on
the size of the facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's a regulator inside and then
there's a computer attached to that and it
[SPEAKER_01]: runs it to each room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then each room's got its own sensors and
it triggers when it's needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sirens and flashy lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so many stupid accessories to be
sold to us and then they had to train us
[SPEAKER_01]: on all the warnings and shit on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They show up once a week and the guy gets
out of his truck and hooks up a tube to
[SPEAKER_01]: our tube and hits go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he sits in the truck and stares at
his phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: He eats breakfast in his truck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I watch him spread his McDonald's
smorgasbord all across the dash and just
[SPEAKER_01]: grubs down and plays with his phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes like 45 minutes to full.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's loud as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like a pump on a closed loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just... Everyone in the grow can hear
it and can't wait until he fucking leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned a trick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to every flowering room and just crank
up the fucking CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it up to 2,000 and he'll just dump
into the whole room while he's filling
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can really crank up those rooms
that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be like, I'm not sure why they're doing
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tanks won't fill up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were really low today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting the same order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, delivering water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, delivering water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here in Pueblo County, both these
businesses, there's air gas or no,
[SPEAKER_00]: not air gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something green clean or some shit that
does the CO2 and then there's only one
[SPEAKER_00]: water company and that's Curry
Transportation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone hates Curry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just deliver water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say too much,
but he doesn't have a lot of fans out
[SPEAKER_00]: there, but they have no other choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got water.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like the number one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, if you're going to get into the
industry, don't try to get into the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry in Colorado if you're
doing it to make money because it's kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of late is kind of, I think, our point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm not trying to discourage
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to be a constant uphill battle
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are too many businesses right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't own the dispensary,
the grow and maybe something else like an
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction or a concentrate company or
some sort of other way to run it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not going to make any money.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a $10 million bill right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Easily a weird piece of advice that I
don't even know if I should share,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I love the listeners and I love the
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something we should warn everybody
about when cannabis becomes popular and I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want to say mainstream because it's
almost mainstream here now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like just a thing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the things pretty much when
everybody gets into it and it becomes part
[SPEAKER_01]: of the daily flow and people start
understanding the products they enjoy and
[SPEAKER_01]: they start picking dispensaries where they
want to go and they start experimenting
[SPEAKER_01]: with what's new and then they start coming
to Colorado and checking out the culture
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your market is going to turn to 25 to 35%
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't see that coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to have all this flowers
sitting there and people aren't going to
[SPEAKER_01]: want to buy flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to want high-end
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was going to start any kind of
marijuana business here in Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: without a doubt, it would be a lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk about them a lot and when they
opened, I had a couple of friends who are
[SPEAKER_01]: business minded.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said, that place will never happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a dispensary that only sells
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have any flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a small grow and they run their
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They cut down the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They turn it into top shelf concentrates
because they grew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They knew exactly how to grow it to
produce the concentrates they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: They harvested it specifically for these
concentrates in their facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: They froze it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They prepared it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they ran it and they make very high
quality concentrates and there's a line
[SPEAKER_01]: every time I go there and they never sell
any flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do carry some edibles that are
outsourced, but they've got concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got batters, butters, HCFSE,
HTFSE.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got them mixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got big 22 gram pucks from the
bottom of the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just 22 gram diamonds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 50 bucks a gram and they don't break
the pucks up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to buy the whole 22 gram puck if
you'd like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's available if you want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They obviously sell them because they have
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got high cannabinoid full spectrum
extract diamonds that weigh three and four
[SPEAKER_01]: and five grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stuff sells.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I shop there quite frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when they opened, people said
their business model wouldn't work a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was even doubting.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're 100% concentrates and it is
working.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is working.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys are trying to build a business
plan, keep in mind that the market will
[SPEAKER_01]: turn to concentrates, vapeable,
smokeable concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why I'm giving you all kinds
of business tips that we should keep to
[SPEAKER_01]: ourselves, but we're already here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're past this step in this market.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just things that I've learned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost used a word that I'm trying to
take out of my vocabulary.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going to love those wack ass
pens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's into the pens now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sell a lot of our product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all it's for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sad to see it go off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nug and trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some companies that are making
some really high quality pens and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: super popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a big fan of them, but one time we
were driving home in a snowstorm and the
[SPEAKER_01]: cars in front of me all fucking spun out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was having a little bit of a like,
oh shit in the car and somebody just
[SPEAKER_01]: reached down and they handed me a pen and
they're like, here, this will help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh yeah, it's like one
good rip off of that pen and set it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh, the nerves are better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can fucking focus on driving again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're great when you're traveling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we, we're not condoning maybe taking a
rip off a pen in the car or while you're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting in the airport or whatever,
but maybe something like that does happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: People love the pens.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pens are super handy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The girls love the pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty inconspicuous at this point
too, because of all the other vaping
[SPEAKER_00]: devices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're going to a concert or
whatever, you could just take your,
[SPEAKER_01]: your dab vape pen right on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go take some waxy hits while you're in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: My problem is I just pretty much cook them
out in like two or three good hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then by then it's roasted and gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of them just don't, I mean,
they're great in certain situations,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like just as a daily use thing,
most of them don't do it for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Myself as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather have a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like they're like half a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a, a normal flower smoker,
if you just smoke flowers, like if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: just a normal work, Jesse and I are kind
of expert level pot smokers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might smoke a little more than the
average bear.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're just a normal smoker,
those pins, since it's concentrates when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're hitting that pen, maybe if you hit
that on a lunch break or while you're on a
[SPEAKER_01]: bike ride, you'll notice that they'll
wreck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll, you'll definitely notice just for
the distillate in them is very potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green dots actually selling a pen that is
made all with the, uh, full spectrum
[SPEAKER_01]: extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they're putting their silver label.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their silver label, full spectrum extract
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're pretty nice from what I've
heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's been giving them rave reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green dots, the shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's who I've been buying lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green dot and apothecary.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my two go-to concentrate companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, TR TR is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like a contraband.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the in-house company for a cut
above.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got some Durban Kush sauce that is
always on point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's star child.
[SPEAKER_01]: OG sauce is some of my favorite,
but it sells out so quickly and they,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're 45 minutes away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't like to drive up there to find
out if they have it for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually never been to a apothecary
or a cut above.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, go check them both out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will enjoy the experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a few years since I had a
Medcar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say if you're shopping in
springs, you got to have that paperwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, it's not even paperwork anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, uh, you can have a PDF on your phone
that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just pretty handy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, my dad got keeps his, uh, he is non
smartphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's got the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had to wait like fucking 60 days or
some shit to get the piece of paper in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mail that I could have printed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just, I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like now when he goes to renew,
I'll be like, just let me come with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back in the day you would go to the
doctor, they would fill out your
[SPEAKER_01]: paperwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would mail some paper to the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: The state would take for fucking ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they would mail you back your card
and then you would have this card.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you could go to the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you lost that card or it got stolen or
whatever happened to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you can't shop at the dispenser.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to mail email or message or write
to the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they would send you a replacement
card.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could prove you were who you were
and that your card was valid and that
[SPEAKER_01]: would take weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they put all the registry online.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you go to the doctor, the doctor types
all your info in while he's visiting you
[SPEAKER_01]: and he hits send it by the time he's done
hitting send your stuff goes to the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: The state reviews it for approval.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen anybody get declined with
the new doctor set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they send you an email, you send in a
payment and then it says print your card
[SPEAKER_01]: is the next tab that pops up and you hit
print and it sends it right to my printer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and you can print your card out now on
regular paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you would like to have a paper copy,
I actually keep one in my glove box in
[SPEAKER_01]: case my phone dies or something goes
weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a paper copy in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, cause I like to shop when I'm out of
town.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to be able to just go ship.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's much cheaper to shop at the,
uh, the medical stores by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I've got my, uh, I've got a PDF
of my card on my phone and honestly all
[SPEAKER_01]: the stores I shop, they know me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just flash it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They barely even look and then you show
your ID and your card and they go,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, come on a Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to see you again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's a much simpler process now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have to deal with the mail so
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we kind of touched on it a minute ago
and it got abandoned cause we were talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about like four things at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, before we start wrapping it up,
let's talk about a couple of the major
[SPEAKER_01]: things people are going to notice when
they go from growing in their basement to
[SPEAKER_01]: a large scale facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that look on your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I don't even know where to look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where to start with that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mean to sound like an asshole or
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's a completely different ball game.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're totally right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't have any notes in front of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of this episode has all been off
the top of my head today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not keeping track of where we're
going a lot of times to keep notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know where we've been a lot of,
there are a ton of inefficiencies in
[SPEAKER_00]: basement grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you guys, I don't mean fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sound like such an asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basement growers, uh, waste an
extraordinary amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And an extraordinary amount of money too,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so you're going to notice going from
like a basement to let's say a 1500 plant
[SPEAKER_00]: grow or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you water that 1500 plant grow the
same way you, you possibly water your
[SPEAKER_00]: basement, uh, it's going to take you a day
and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you get to the end, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to need water yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, things like D leafing and topping,
uh, take so much more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you wouldn't believe what it takes to
say top 250 plants or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, when I have guys do that,
I'm normally, I'd probably say three,
[SPEAKER_00]: four hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are guys that do that,
you know, uh, what, you know, once a week
[SPEAKER_00]: they're professionals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it still takes, you know,
a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's just every, the workload is so,
so much bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, little insect problems turn big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very fucking quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, man, there's just, it's a completely
different ball game.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, having a backyard
garden versus having, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: two acre garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good way to put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, you know, around like week four,
five, and six, uh, there's a lot of video
[SPEAKER_01]: game time, but you got a basement grow
like week four or five and six or any shit
[SPEAKER_01]: to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you got to have some D leafing and
whatever, but all the toppings been done.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lollipopping is done.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the trellising is in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just making sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're in that like fingers are
crossed kind of no powdery mildew home
[SPEAKER_01]: stretch, hoping sure that, or making sure
that no spider mites pop up now at the
[SPEAKER_01]: end.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like week four or five, six,
seven, eight, nine fucking play an Xbox.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like selling the last crop is what we used
to be busy looking smoking and selling the
[SPEAKER_01]: last one, weighing out bags and meeting up
with people with what we used to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that doesn't happen anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's none of that video game time,
that video game time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're cutting clones for the crop
that's coming up in two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you're done cutting clones,
you have to get the other clones that were
[SPEAKER_01]: already cut and put them into the six inch
net pots or the four by four pots and then
[SPEAKER_00]: it's in through their rotation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as you're done with that,
you have to go up pot the ones that were
[SPEAKER_01]: already done into the three gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once those are done, you have to
move those other three gallon pots into
[SPEAKER_01]: that room.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's empty now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just never stops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it never, there's never a,
and if you fall behind one day,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're two days behind because you have to
do today's work two days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what are you going to do about
tomorrow's work?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to do that sometime
also.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're either going to have to work
some overtime or you're going to have to
[SPEAKER_01]: catch up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doubles the pace.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jesse started off the best way,
uh, that shows that Jesse and I have
[SPEAKER_01]: evolved a long way from being basement
growers to becoming business minded
[SPEAKER_01]: professional growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it gradually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause when we started the average
commercial grow room didn't look too much
[SPEAKER_00]: different than a basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first couple of commercial grows were
just expanded basement grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen clone areas bigger than,
but yeah, uh, people that have been around
[SPEAKER_00]: as long as me and Jeff, uh, kind of grew
into it organically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't jump into, don't, don't think your
first facility needs to be a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Figure out how to kill one light worth of
plants before you figure out how to kill a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred lights worth of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, then he said, you're wasting a lot
of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're wasting a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about when you're in that grow,
there's the licenses are so expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: The heating is so expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lighting is so expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: The air conditioning is so expensive and
you're in there all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Staffing is way expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rent, the rent, water bill,
water bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: The water bill taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when you go this, this may sound
racist, but maybe it is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you go to YouTube and you watch
people doing their jobs and it's always
[SPEAKER_01]: people from other countries, it's some
other very cultural country.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dude's got a knife and a mango and his
job is to peel mangoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fucker doesn't blink, but his right
hand just makes this motion.
[SPEAKER_01]: This left, right, left, right,
left, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the mango in his left hand just
fucking spins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody blinks and all these mangoes are
peeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to get processes like
that down in your facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told all of our guys, get Asian on it,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like get Asian, turn into an Asian factory
worker, but you still have to be mindful
[SPEAKER_01]: at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've accomplished a lot, um, in the last
couple of years at this crew with,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the help of great employees,
but, um, uh, or mostly great employees,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're not there anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, the good ones always move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good ones have stayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shitty ones have moved on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, no, it's pretty fortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can't say that about everyone
that's moved on from there, but I'll just
[SPEAKER_00]: shut my mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, uh, being a manager is a bitch
sometimes, ain't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Developing the systems that we have
developed is like one of my proudest
[SPEAKER_00]: achievements there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, it's something that I
really consider carries a lot of weight on
[SPEAKER_00]: my resume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, if, if another serious
business, uh, grow type was to look at it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that that's, you know,
that's what I'm going to be put throwing
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, um, the, yeah,
it's just, you move this industry along.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't, I don't think about it that
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're kind of pioneers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were here when, like, I was part of
Metomar, the first dispensary in town
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first dispensaries in the
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the first, it was the first one in
this city.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were some outside of our city
limits, but it was the, we were right in
[SPEAKER_01]: the heart of downtown, just doing it loud
and proud.
[SPEAKER_01]: That product was grown in my basement on,
in another part of town here in another
[SPEAKER_01]: house.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where that used to come from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they built another little thing in
their building that was a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, we had some other friends,
I don't know how much I could talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's in the past, but I still
don't want to throw people under the bus.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had somebody that built a fairly,
semi-large warehouse that needed help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they let us come.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were there for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went and helped out sometimes and we
both had other people build greenhouses
[SPEAKER_01]: and other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got to go see, Oh, it got bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then people in Springs needed help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to go see even bigger places.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, wow, it's getting bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you can tell who has been in big
facilities, but you take somebody with you
[SPEAKER_01]: and they walk in places and their chin
hits the floor or they just nod like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny to watch people see they either
pass out and get shaky or they're just
[SPEAKER_01]: like, yeah, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to get jaded about a lot of
things, but when I do a tour at the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: and I get that jaw hit in the floor,
like it just, it takes me back a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me smile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, to see someone have that
kind of passion for, um, for all of this,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just kind of reminds me of where
it came from.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put in blood, sweat, tears,
and more blood, sweat and tears.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, we look at it a little
differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I try to never,
uh, try to never lose that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to still love my photography,
love growing the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can see it in the photography
that I'm still still in love with those
[SPEAKER_01]: girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's I've still, you know, I'm not
completely jaded, uh, the day to day
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, it's, uh, I hate it cause I used
to talk shit about it, but, or talk shit
[SPEAKER_00]: about people that thought this way,
but, um, it's a lot of just moving widgets
[SPEAKER_00]: from one place to the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's a good, it's a production.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a conveyor belt.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just got to keep that conveyor belt
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we'll get a new clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always get jazzed about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, pop a pack of seeds here and
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the kind of shit that just,
all it takes is a new cut in the garden,
[SPEAKER_01]: a new pack of seeds, or just that new
opportunity for something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you find out this new grow tech,
you're like, Oh, we're going to try that
[SPEAKER_01]: on the whole next crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the whole next crop is super exciting
just because of some new idea that you
[SPEAKER_01]: got.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Testing products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a test.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bunch of new stuff for a couple
companies we use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's always fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like side-by-side tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to do when you've got 3,600
plants in bloom and you tell two
[SPEAKER_01]: companies, yeah, I'm going to run your
stuff on this many plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like, Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they help you dial it in and you
get your schedule figured out with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you do the other company and get
it dialed in with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you just go head to head and go
see what happens, weigh the weights at the
[SPEAKER_01]: end, test the potency at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like being a Roman emperor,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you create.
[SPEAKER_00]: Victors and victims.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause someone's always going to be sad
when that happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the look on the grow techs faces
when new clones come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, uh, they come in in a box and
it's covered, you know, cause nobody can
[SPEAKER_01]: see anything as it's being transferred.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you open the box and it's like
the suitcase on pulp fiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's in here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Rasta Jeff and they'll gather around like
Santa Claus or like grandpa on the
[SPEAKER_01]: Christmas morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one says it's for Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's in the bag of presents?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all excited about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you pull out it's Clementine and like,
Oh, Clementine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they cheer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You pull out the next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's blueberry cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And someone in the back is like blueberry
cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always so much fun to see people and
you get new cuts in the facility,
[SPEAKER_01]: even the tremors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, what did we get?
[SPEAKER_00]: What did we get?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the tremors more so sometimes than,
than grow techs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, because they've been trimming that
fucking ghost dog for the past seven days
[SPEAKER_01]: and they cannot wait to trim something
that's not ghost dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever's next, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just tired of looking at this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I need to keep my mouth shut right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was about to say something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trimming you guys keep in mind that when
it comes, when you have a commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: facility, uh, you just cut down,
we've been throwing out huge numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we used to cut down 40 lights worth of
plants at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would dry up to be about 75 to 85
pounds of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine trimming that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But where are you going to hang it to dry
it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's such a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, and this is part of why you have
to have space.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have a dehumidifier,
a humidifier, an air conditioner and a fan
[SPEAKER_01]: all fighting each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, there's always problems in a grow
this size because either you're not new
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff always comes up, even if you're
doing your job, especially if you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: your job very well, new problems come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's, you always got problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are we going to put all this weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Seems to be part of the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: This weed is, we haven't, you can't back
crops up in the dry and cure room because
[SPEAKER_01]: if you've got this one that's almost ready
to go into the containers and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: bring in this fresh one that just got cut
down, you're just going to re-moisten all
[SPEAKER_01]: of those other buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's so many challenges,
things you're going to have to think about
[SPEAKER_01]: when it comes time to build your large
facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, this episode started off with an
idea of talking about the differences
[SPEAKER_01]: between why it's so easy outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, and why it's so much more
challenging indoors because every piece of
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment you put in there, you got to put
another piece of equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put in a light, you got to put an
equipment cooling a piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you put in cooling that makes heat
outsides and now you got to, it just,
[SPEAKER_01]: it all backs up on itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you got to make sure the power is
safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please don't burn down your house trying
to run too many amps on one breaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen some scary things melt and shit
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it turned into us kind of talking
about just random grow industry stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope you guys enjoyed hanging out,
listening to this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro, you got any stuff you want to ramble
about since we've got you here on the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast and you don't come over often
enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually really stoked about my market
farm business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and Derek from the Colorado podcasts,
the summer for years, I listened to
[SPEAKER_00]: podcasts a lot while I'm working in big
grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of turned towards some
podcasts that were centered on urban
[SPEAKER_00]: farming and small farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Derek would listen to him with me and
I always talk shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I could do that fucking
shit, you know, this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this spring I decided to put my,
you know, to actually do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, shut up saying I can do it and show
that I can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been farming, uh, 800 square
feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said farming and 800 square feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It still counts, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, fuck dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've, uh, we've had some beds have turned
over four times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I had produce available and for sell
before most of the commercial farmers out
[SPEAKER_00]: in the County, even fucking had seed in
the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we've probably grown about 300 pounds
of food so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he brought me a nice, uh, some
groceries.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like I went shopping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was nice and lush, nice and green
sticking out all the bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be part of my dinner
tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always nice eating things that were
grown right across town by somebody that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, put some love into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super, super organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I can't use that word because the
government stole it from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, uh, it's fueled by compost and
warm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's, you know, that's pretty
much it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I put down a little bit of bio live
from, uh, down to earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we threw some, a little of that down
early in the season, a little kelp meal
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where, uh, where can locals find you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen you set up at the, uh,
the farmer's market there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where can people come find your produce?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we do, uh, um, we've got one more
market this year that is already planned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's the Belmont market at the Christ
congregational church, uh, here in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, other than that, like we didn't make
a, uh, commitment to a full scale farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: market this year, cause it was our first
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want most of the time farmers
markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't just want vendors coming and
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need a commitment from you for the
full season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they know they got that booth sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, you know, I had some doubt myself,
uh, about a few things and, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just the nature of learning a
new business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to commit to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not at a steady market yet,
but we have a Facebook page, hit us up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There and, uh, we will totally ship you
over some veggies, uh, anywhere here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Alma Verde farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's ALMA Verde, like color green.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys support the, the local,
local vegetables produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good stuff grown by my buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next year we're going to be on an acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, pretty much finished up a deal to rent
an acre that's got water on it out in the
[SPEAKER_00]: county.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah, we're, uh, if we can get our
funding figured out, cause this stuff is
[SPEAKER_00]: not cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: People forget the farming costs a lot of
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we get our funding figured out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be farming anywhere from a
quarter to a half acre, uh, with plans for
[SPEAKER_00]: a third year to expand into the full
Laker.
[SPEAKER_01]: So excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish you, wish you luck with that one,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope it goes well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to more of those fresh
veggies for sure.

coffee and watermelon candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely get the dark roast coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no watermelon candy on my palette,
but it did taste like a creamy mocha
[SPEAKER_01]: coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never had a dab that tasted like
coffee before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great work by green dot labs.
