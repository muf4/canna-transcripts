[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 418 of the Grow From
Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by our friends at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: On 420, Oregon Elite Seeds will be
dropping the first batch of Blue Raspberry
[SPEAKER_00]: Truffle from iReGenetics, so make sure you
check them out at www.oregoneliteseeds
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has become a tradition that we start
this podcast off by talking about what I
[SPEAKER_00]: am dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a dab of Blackberry,
Banana Kush, Ambrosia from our friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency label says that this is 74.4%
THC and 85.4% total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the Blackberry, Banana Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect ratio of turps to crunchy
diamonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful color.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor was perfect and the high is
just right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, big shout out to my friends at
Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to pick up
where we left off in the last show and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to read an email about Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get there, let's do some
shout outs from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
friend Richard Goles.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a shout out to Keith Klump?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast
shout out to Remy Redeye.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, a big shout out to Brett
Gorman.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big shout out to my friend
Full Monty?
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but not least, how about a big
shout out to my friend Riley Hansen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to everybody who supports the
show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to learn how to get a
shout out on the start of the show and
[SPEAKER_00]: become a patron, you can go to patreon.com
slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the start of the show, I said I had an
email about Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into that email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Rasta Jeff, I am from Prohibition
Land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please do not say my name on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it when people start the email out
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will make sure not to say your name,
but thank you for the great email because
[SPEAKER_00]: it goes on like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have fallen in love with the Golden Goat
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have learned that it helps with my
migraines and my depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I knew Golden Goat was good for
migraines, but I did not know that it was
[SPEAKER_00]: good for depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is good to read that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that it's helping you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bummer to hear that you've got
depression, but it's great to hear that
[SPEAKER_00]: the Golden Goat is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says in reading about the Golden Goat,
I have discovered that you have bred a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of strains with and from the Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can tell us on the podcast why
you fell in love with Golden Goat and why
[SPEAKER_00]: you use it in so many of your projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they sign their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they said, PS, thank you for all that
you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the support and thanks for the
great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for the opportunity to talk
about one of my favorite strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about Golden Goat a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I should say about Golden
Goat is I did not breed or create the
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was not my creation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat was bred by a person known as
Mr. Dank in Topeka, Kansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I cannot take credit for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've taken a lot of great pictures of
Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done a lot of breeding with Golden
Goat and I have made feminized seeds of
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat, which I have released to the
public.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've also made Golden Goat BX1 and
I've got some Golden Goat BX2 seeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've done a lot of work with the Golden
Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Golden Goat BX1 beans are available
through the Hela Dank Seed Company and
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't have them, they are
unavailable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until I make more.
[SPEAKER_00]: The feminized seeds will be available
again in July.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check Oregon Elite Seeds first for Golden
Goat Femseeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already know I'm going to get a bunch of
emails because I said that I make Golden
[SPEAKER_00]: Goat seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the places you can check for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon Elite Seeds and the Hela Dank Seed
Company at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you may be able to find
Golden Goat seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not make the original Golden Goat,
but I did make feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did make a bat cross that was made by
Mr. Dank in Topeka, Kansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the cross of Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the parents of Golden Goat?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a Hawaiian Sativa cross to Romulan
male that pollinated an island sweet skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing a little bit about each of
those parents, I can tell you where a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of those traits came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tall stretchy thing comes from the
Hawaiian Sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tropical flavor comes from the island
sweet skunk and the Hawaiian Sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: That short squatty structure is mostly
from the Romulan.
[SPEAKER_00]: The finishing time comes from the Romulan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a beautiful combination of all
three of those crosses and I think it
[SPEAKER_00]: worked out beautifully in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is another phenotype that was not
released as widely and was not as popular
[SPEAKER_00]: as the Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the best of my knowledge, that
phenotype was labeled Funky Bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen Funky Bitch flowers and
concentrates available in dispensaries in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Denver area, but there is no way for
me to know if that was named, if that is
[SPEAKER_00]: the original Funky Bitch released by Mr.
Dank or if that is just another fish fan
[SPEAKER_00]: using the name Funky Bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it is a song that fish plays a
cover of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a quick breakdown on the genetic
history of Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a Hawaiian Sativa cross to Romulan
male that pollinated an island sweet skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: female that created the Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be another phenotype known as
Funky Bitch roaming around somewhere out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was made by Mr. Dank in Topeka,
Kansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about why Mr. Dank named it
Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: In parts of the country, there is a
recycling center that is called the Golden
[SPEAKER_00]: Goat Recycling Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the thick of the summer,
that soda in the recycling center gets a
[SPEAKER_00]: sticky sweet smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mr. Dank thought that Golden Goat
smelled just like that recycling center.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is where that name came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat came from the aroma of the
Golden Goat recycling plant near Mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dank's home in Topeka or near the grow in
Topeka.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat generally flowers in around 60
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can come down a little bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can come down a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just depends on what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, I would run
her for nine weeks and she would be
[SPEAKER_00]: beautifully, perfectly done at the end of
the nine week flowering period.
[SPEAKER_00]: She gave me big fat, heavy harvests,
and I really like running Golden Goat in a
[SPEAKER_00]: small grow and in a large grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna talk more about that in just a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat is consistently a very potent,
a very high THC tester when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: lab tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes back in the high 20s every time
and I have not gotten it past 29% yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I have gotten a 29% THC lab test from
Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a consistently high tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that tropical Golden Goat,
that sweet, sticky aroma, that tropical
[SPEAKER_00]: saltwater aroma that comes from it,
it can't be beat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very unique and it is very
desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have it in the bag, it looks
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into a little bit more detail of
how I fell in love with Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've told you the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know where it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of know how long it takes to
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did I end up with this Golden Goat?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a friend who I met when I was
working in a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy probably doesn't want his name
blasted on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I nicknamed him Pineapple Express because
he was really from Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just thought it was funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was my stoner friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was from Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: His nickname for this show will be
Pineapple Express.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Pineapple Express and I became really
good friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hung out quite often.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would smoke together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would bullshit together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would do clone trades together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would talk about each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would go to each other's gardens
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just pothead buddies.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day, my friend Pineapple Express was
gifted a clone of the Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: He asked me if I knew anything about the
plant and I told him I had heard nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: but good things about Golden Goat and that
I would love a clone of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, I had been buying Golden Goat
from a local dispensary known as The
[SPEAKER_00]: Greener Side and I was really happy with
the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of Golden Goat going
around the area and I was really impressed
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to get my hands on this plant,
I knew I could really grow the shit out of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friend Pineapple Express gave me a
clone of the Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew it until I could get a clone off of
it so that I had a keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I flowered out that first little
Golden Goat and my first run with that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant was impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever I was doing with my nutrient
regimen, whatever I was doing with my
[SPEAKER_00]: lights, whatever my VPD was, whatever was
happening in my grow environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat said, hey, that is fucking
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of like I had found the plant
that went in my room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of my plants were really happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything looked really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I put Golden Goat in that
environment, it was like, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the happiest plant you can ever find
for this environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have to adjust anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have to change my feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have to change my grow style.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really blew up and it really excelled
in my room just the way it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that made me fall in love with it right
away in the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a gifted clone that I had heard
a lot about, that I had smoked already,
[SPEAKER_00]: that I had enjoyed and I knew I wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I got it, I crushed it in my
first grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that made me really happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right away, I also took some tremendous
photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the very first photos I posted to
social media were of Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to stay away from like the
Facebook and that sort of thing for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was posting on other places,
very cannabis specific forums and groups
[SPEAKER_00]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But things like Facebook and Instagram,
I was a little bit afraid to go on
[SPEAKER_00]: something so public, so mainstream and
share my cannabis photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed a few pictures of the Golden Goat
to my friend Pineapple Express,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he really encouraged me to put them
online.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I made the iRegenetics Facebook and I
started posting photos of Golden Goat as
[SPEAKER_00]: my very first post on my Facebook for
iRegenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was my first grow with Golden
Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The photos were good enough to where my
friend Pineapple Express felt that I
[SPEAKER_00]: should create a social media page just for
those photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that inspired a lot of more
photography, a lot more sharing,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot more social interaction,
a lot more social media interaction,
[SPEAKER_00]: and actually a large expansion of what I
wanted to be a very small seed company to
[SPEAKER_00]: make seeds for myself and my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ended up getting a little out of hand
and it has become a little bit more than
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is a whole other podcast to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's focus on Golden Goat here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat was, I was already amazed by
this plant before I got a hold of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I grew it and I grew the shit out of
it the first time, I fell in love.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I fell in love.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was such a fun grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything I could do to this plant,
it could take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when I smoked it, I was so proud of
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tasted amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency was tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't take a lot to dry and cure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really fuck up Golden Goat
unless you're trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to kind of try.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure there's somebody out there
that has destroyed a Golden Goat plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just put their head down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the way I grow, I couldn't fuck it
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was love and life in my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was great flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had gigantic harvests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my biggest harvests in my personal
grows, not in a commercial environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: have come from Golden Goat and Golden Goat
dominant hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about a couple of those in the
future if we don't run out of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In an indoor personal grow environment,
I am able to easily pull 2.5 pounds per
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand watt light with Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, it would not
be unheard of for me to pull over three
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds per light in a commercial
environment with Golden Goat or Golden
[SPEAKER_00]: Goat dominant genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a very generous plant once you
learn to work with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I'll mention, and this isn't
really a grow lesson on Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more on how I fell in love with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will get new growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will get nutrient deficient very
easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants more nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants macronutrients all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see it start to get deficient and
you will never catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to foliar feed it to get it
enough nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get macronutrient early.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feed it kind of heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is how you get that plant to take
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you get those big fat harvests.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to feed it very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said earlier that some of my best
harvests were from Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my most impressive photos were
also from Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a Golden Goat photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is in front of a Colorado flag that
goes around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been reposted and reposted on a lot
of social media outlets.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a picture I am very proud of.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a grow that I am very proud of.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a beautiful grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lollipopped those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did six of those Golden Goat plants in
seven gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had six seven gallon pots under 1000
watt light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lollipopped them fairly high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not top them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had one big fat glory bud and I
pulled 2.5 pounds of usable buds and then
[SPEAKER_00]: plenty of small popcorn buds and usable
trim that we turned into concentrates
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath 1000 watt light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those buds were some of the most
photogenic buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants were some of the most
photogenic, happiest, healthiest looking
[SPEAKER_00]: plants I have ever grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lollipopped them beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: I defoliated them beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I took great care of those
plants from the beginning to the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I did everything right with
those Golden Goat plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things like that will really make you
fall in love with the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've grown it several times and
that's something I'm going to get off on a
[SPEAKER_00]: tangent here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I feel like a lot of new
growers are not doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're treating their plants kind of like
they're just one night stands.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow that one strain one time and you
want to get rid of it because you saw that
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody posted wedding cake number 44
across to gelato number 75 and they called
[SPEAKER_00]: it wedding gelato number 9000 and you've
got to grow that next.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get that and you grow it and it did
okay, but it wasn't super fucking fire
[SPEAKER_00]: impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to get rid of that and
you're going to get the clones of the mac
[SPEAKER_00]: across to fucking wook dick number 7.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to grow that and you'll do
okay with it because it's fire genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're not going to reach its full
potential and you're going to be annoyed
[SPEAKER_00]: with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get something new and
you're not going to grow that to its full
[SPEAKER_00]: potential either because you're not going
to get a cultivar to its full potential on
[SPEAKER_00]: its first run.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to learn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're going to kill it on the first
try if you're a good grower with good
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics, but you can ultra fucking kill
it on the third and fourth run with those
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics if you learn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine your dance partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine you're making love to somebody the
first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's maybe you kill it the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you get lucky, but the first couple
times dancing, making love to somebody,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a little awkward.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not sure what they're into.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not sure what you're allowed to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not sure how far you can push the
limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the same with the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to try it a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what they go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and see if they go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to pay attention and you got to
learn three or four times in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know exactly what that plant likes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how long it takes and you make it
fucking perfect by the third or fourth
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to develop a relationship with
these plants and stop running them one
[SPEAKER_00]: time and getting rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what you want to do,
go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like you would develop a better
relationship with the cultivar and you
[SPEAKER_00]: could have more satisfactory results with
the same cultivar if you ran it more than
[SPEAKER_00]: one time and dialed it in and learned what
that plant wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I have an episode planned for you
in the future that is called dialed in and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to talk about dialing in your
garden to get beautiful, perfect flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get my high ass back on track
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm in love with the Golden Goat
because it grows like a champ.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has given me beautiful harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has given me amazing potency and it has
given me some amazing photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also works very well with my body and
my brain chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something about the buzz from Golden Goat
is very medicating to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a traumatic brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't talk about that a lot on the show
anymore because that's not what the show
[SPEAKER_00]: is about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also got a stomach issue and some
blunt out knees.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I smoke the Golden Goat, my traumatic
brain injury seems to kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget that I've got a brain injury,
which is really funny if you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: brain injury and you think about
forgetting shit, but I forget about the
[SPEAKER_00]: brain injury and I forget that my brain is
broken and all the little weird glitches
[SPEAKER_00]: that are caused by the brain injury,
they seem to go away when I smoke Golden
[SPEAKER_00]: Goat dominant hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also seems to work very well to keep me
motivated and energized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some cultivars will make people kind of
less motivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll kind of wear you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll mellow you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make you a little slower and
possibly less productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to say that cannabis makes
people lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: When lazy people smoke the wrong type of
cannabis, it will make you lazier.
[SPEAKER_00]: When motivated people smoke the wrong
strain of cannabis, it could slow down
[SPEAKER_00]: your motivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is a very possible thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have found that the Golden Goat will
keep me moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat and Golden Goat dominant
hybrids keep my brain sharp.
[SPEAKER_00]: They keep me motivated and off of the
couch and that is something that I need
[SPEAKER_00]: because I am a busy person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to get a lot of shit done every
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is another reason why I've fallen
in love with the Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works beautifully for medicinal and
recreational purposes for me and it just
[SPEAKER_00]: puts all the pieces back together and I
can smoke it day or night and I enjoy it
[SPEAKER_00]: anytime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically I enjoy Golden Goat because
we get along very well in all aspects that
[SPEAKER_00]: I could ask for.
[SPEAKER_00]: She grows well.
[SPEAKER_00]: She smokes well.
[SPEAKER_00]: She takes great photos and one of my
favorite parts is she breeds very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything I breed to the Golden Goat comes
out better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat hybrids all bring out that
delicious sweet tropical flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all come out as pretty heavy
producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all seem to be fairly resistant to
problems like pathogens, like pests,
[SPEAKER_00]: like powdery mildew, like Boitritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all seem to be fairly pest resistant
and everything I cross with Golden Goat
[SPEAKER_00]: seems to be quite vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of its offspring have pretty stout
stalks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all seem to grow with pretty sturdy
structure and I really like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I really like about the
Golden Goat is it does this sort of a spin
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most plants, if you look at them from
above, they shoot out a node going left
[SPEAKER_00]: and right and then what would be up and
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to refer to that as north,
south, east and west.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of your cultivars will do a north,
south, east and west sort of a stem
[SPEAKER_00]: development or a branching development.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Golden Goat will do a north,
south, east and west and then it throws in
[SPEAKER_00]: another pair.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where most of your plants have four
sets of branches, the Golden Goat will
[SPEAKER_00]: produce six and it will only do this if
you get it super dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when it is extremely happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll start making more branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you crack and twist the Golden
Goat to try to slow it down, she just gets
[SPEAKER_00]: more sturdy, more robust, thicker stalks
and then she gets a little bit stronger
[SPEAKER_00]: and she can support those big chunky buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat also makes a lot of very
sturdy branching and most of her offspring
[SPEAKER_00]: makes a lot of very sturdy branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the more branching you have,
the more opportunity you have for bud
[SPEAKER_00]: sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also sturdier branching means you can make
bigger chunkier fatter buds and not need
[SPEAKER_00]: as much support and maintenance in the
grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great thing about Golden Goat is
she will get slightly tall on you,
[SPEAKER_00]: but she stays short and bushy for the most
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Romulan dominance in her keeps her
short and gives her a really nice
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is mostly why I love the Golden
Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: She breeds beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about some of the hybrids I
have made with Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have used Golden Goat as a reversed
female and I have taken pollen from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat and made other crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most popular cross from that,
of course, is Lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Jeffrey is one of my favorite
crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's got my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a reversed Golden Goat to the lemon
skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes lemon candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of smells like if you took a box
of lemon heads and dumped the lemon heads
[SPEAKER_00]: out and you smell the inside of the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that soft, sweet, sugary lemon
smell to it or sort of like country time
[SPEAKER_00]: lemonade powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what I think Lemon Jeffrey smells
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a very vigorous plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an excellent plant for concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is an excellent plant for my type
of a condition with a traumatic brain
[SPEAKER_00]: injury or people with anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a wonderful daytime smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is one of my favorite Golden Goat
hybrids from the femme direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the regular seed line.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my most popular crosses is Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise is a Golden Goat female pollinated
by a daybreaker male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done an entire episode on the
strain Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to listen to an entire
episode about the strain Arise,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is episode number 329.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you would enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise is a great strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has got amazing potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually used an Arise male to make
many, many hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've probably made 30 crosses from Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only released about 15 or 20 of them,
but I have made 30, maybe 40 crosses from
[SPEAKER_00]: an Arise male that I've really fallen in
love with.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: He makes beautiful offspring and he gives
everything hyper vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of that comes from the
Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gives everything a lot of potency that
comes from the Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a lot of the Golden Goat
traits in many of his offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that I talked about earlier
is Golden Goat BX.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have made a Golden Goat BX.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people want Golden Goat seeds,
but Golden Goat is not available in a
[SPEAKER_00]: regular seed form.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have made feminized Golden Goat seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are unadulterated pure Golden Goat
S1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Golden Goat BX seeds were made because
many people wanted non-feminized Golden
[SPEAKER_00]: Goat seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are not fans of femme
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They asked for the BX.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I could do that, so I made a
Golden Goat BX.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will talk about how I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: To make a Golden Goat back cross,
I obviously start with a Golden Goat
[SPEAKER_00]: female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I took a male that was very opposite
of Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The male that I used was that Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I bred the Golden Goat to the
Daybreaker was because they were total
[SPEAKER_00]: opposites in every way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat has that sativa dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got thin, long, skinny leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a taller structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a really tropical, sweet,
candy sort of a flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was completely different than
the Daybreaker plant that I used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daybreaker was a little more OG Kush-like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had further node spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little bit stretchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had big, fat, white leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a really dark, musky, funky sort of
aroma to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that crossing those plants would
make very unique offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where the Arise came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where the King Solomon male came
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: From that batch of seeds came another very
unique, very carefully selected Golden
[SPEAKER_00]: Goat dominant male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used a Golden Goat female so that I
could obviously find the Golden Goat
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used the male Daybreaker because it is
completely the opposite of Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: This made it very simple for me to
identify phenotypes that looked like
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat and phenotypes that looked
like the Daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could very quickly cull any phenotypes
with a wide leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could cull any phenotypes with a far
node spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could cull any phenotypes that had any
sort of stretchy branching because that
[SPEAKER_00]: was not Golden Goat's traits at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see it in the progeny immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see it early in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just by leaf size and shape, it was very
obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of a semi-large population of seeds,
it was easy for me to cull about half of
[SPEAKER_00]: them because I could see the
Daybreaker-leaning phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I am left with mostly Golden Goat
dominant-leaning phenotypes as they showed
[SPEAKER_00]: more traits of the Daybreaker and less
Golden Goat dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would remove them from the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not what I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I put them into flower,
I was able to reduce my numbers by about
[SPEAKER_00]: 50% because I removed all of the females
at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking for that Golden Goat
dominant male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not want to waste time and space for
females, so I narrowed it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a very good selection batch of males
to select from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, now I am paying very close attention
to this very small number of male plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and I am setting these plants right next
to my Golden Goat female that is in veg so
[SPEAKER_00]: that I can compare.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am looking at node spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am looking at leaf shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the leaf shape, I took a leaf off of my
Golden Goat plant that was in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a leaf off of a Golden Goat plant
that was in flower and I compared those
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf sizes and shapes to these Golden Goat
males that were potentially going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: used for the back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I am taking leaves off of the plant
that is acceptable and I am sizing them up
[SPEAKER_00]: next to the plants that are my potential
mates and I am looking and I am saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, your leaves are a little bit different
or your reacting differently to the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients or you are not doing what I want
to see Golden Goat do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have grown Golden Goat so much that I
know what it does and I am looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants and I am saying, you are not
the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you do not perform the way Golden
Goat performs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I would get rid of these male plants
as I saw them showing me any sign of,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, I am not the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: One red flag, it had to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need the exact match.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what I am looking for because I do
not want to make Golden Goat BX crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: that are mostly Golden Goat with a little
hint of Daybreaker in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is that opportunity because it is
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the way nature works, but I did my
best to eliminate that opportunity with my
[SPEAKER_00]: selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I went as far as to rub the stem of
that male plant and smell it with one
[SPEAKER_00]: hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I rubbed the other stem of the other
plant with the other hand and I would hold
[SPEAKER_00]: them to my face and see if they both
smelled exactly the same and I found one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smelled exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The node spacing was perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaf shape was perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got down to the detail of counting the
serrations on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little obsessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little bit crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a lot of dabs into this project,
but I feel like in the end, I did a very
[SPEAKER_00]: good job at selecting the male to use for
this Golden Goat BX project and what tells
[SPEAKER_00]: me that I did a good job at selecting is
when I run these Golden Goat seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: they look a lot like the clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ninety percent of them look just like the
clone that I have got in my room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you took that mother plant,
you took a clone from it and you sprouted
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 of those Golden Goat seeds,
when you eliminate 50 of them for being
[SPEAKER_00]: males, that's going to give you 45
beautiful seedlings that look just like
[SPEAKER_00]: the mother plant of the Golden Goat clone
that I have got that was created from Mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dank seeds in Topeka, Kansas several years
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that is my story on how I selectively
and very carefully made a Golden Goat BX.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my story on how I fell in love
with Golden Goat and why I choose to breed
[SPEAKER_00]: with it so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a great question.
