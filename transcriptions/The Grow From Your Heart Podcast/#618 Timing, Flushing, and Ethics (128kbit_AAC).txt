[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks and big shout-out to everybody
who supports the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not already supporting the show
and you would like to learn how to do so,
[SPEAKER_00]: all you have to do is visit www.patreon
.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, you know, I did include a
link in the show notes and in the video
[SPEAKER_00]: description to make it nice and easy for
all of my friends who could be working,
[SPEAKER_00]: driving, maybe you're in the garden with
your hands full.
[SPEAKER_00]: That link will be there when you're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to another podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are in a weird transitional time here
in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the Midwest, you know what I'm
talking about right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was negative 17 degrees a couple of
weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got up to 74 degrees a couple of days
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then this weekend we're supposed to get
dumped on with snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes growing really challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you set up your gear?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you set up the air conditioner?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you set up the heater?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to get things going in that sort
of environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do feel for you and I wish you the
best of luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to your monitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using the Minder unit,
the Pulse Grow, whatever you've got in
[SPEAKER_00]: there telling you what's going on,
stay on top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out your nighttime humidity and
temperatures because when the sun goes
[SPEAKER_00]: down and that snow is out there,
shit gets really cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to pay really close attention to
all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, speaking of springtime, don't forget
that it's almost time to get your outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: garden prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is March.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is almost time to put the plants
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got months to go, but we want to
find good plants to put outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have your seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have your clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have your nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a plan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have your space?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you prepping your babies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you prepping your environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you prepping your outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have your outdoor grow here in
March?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the middle of March.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time this episode comes out,
you need to start getting ready for your
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you sprouted your seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you popped your clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you sexed your plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done an episode on people putting big
ass plants outside and finding out halfway
[SPEAKER_00]: through the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you done some sex testing to find out
that your outdoor plants are females?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get ready for outdoor season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do my best to get Jesse or another
outdoor expert on the show to guide us
[SPEAKER_00]: through the outdoor season so we can set
ourselves up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to be successful, we must start now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get your seeds, get your clones,
get your outdoor environment planned,
[SPEAKER_00]: started ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start thinking about that shit before it
is way too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to spring, winter, spring time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, let's jump into the main topics
of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have three wonderful emails that I
would like to address.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't write down the full email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of a conversation between
another friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, I am 10 days from week eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that made me think, bro, you were in
week six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Settle the fuck down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thing I wanted to talk about was
when a plant, when a seed package says
[SPEAKER_00]: that those seeds will be done in eight
weeks, it doesn't mean when the clock
[SPEAKER_00]: turns to eight weeks, your plants should
be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to finish out that eighth week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let those finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not the first day of week eight
when your plants are done.
[SPEAKER_00]: When my buddy said I am 10 days away from
week eight and I'll get to cut down in
[SPEAKER_00]: about 10 or 12 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought, bro, that is week.
[SPEAKER_00]: The end of week seven is where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your people are getting really
overzealous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the word here, they're not giving
the plants the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it says eight weeks, those plants
need eight full weeks of flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to repeat this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say this quite often on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day one of the flowering cycle is when you
change the timer to 1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are running photo period plants,
if you're running auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: do your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's none of my business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stay away from those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like photo period plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are running photo period plants in
your garden, day one of flower is when you
[SPEAKER_00]: turn that light cycle to 12 hours on and
12 hours off, or maybe it's 1113,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you get the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: The day you make the flip is when the
plants are now in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not when you start seeing pre-flower,
not when the fucking cow jumps over the
[SPEAKER_00]: moon, not when the fat lady sings.
[SPEAKER_00]: The day you flip, that is the day plants
have gone into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would we have a schedule and a
calendar that we can mark?
[SPEAKER_00]: Day one is right now, but then let's just
wait a few days until the plants give us a
[SPEAKER_00]: hint or until some other random shit
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a seed breeder, as the person
determining how long it takes the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: to flower and marking that on the package,
I can tell you I am doing it by the day we
[SPEAKER_00]: flip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're trying to convince somebody
otherwise, if you're trying to go buy
[SPEAKER_00]: something else, you are not doing industry
standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Industry standard is flowering starts the
day we flip.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants do 12-12.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the package says eight weeks,
they need to go eight full weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: not seven weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the start of eight week,
we cut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to finish that eighth week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, be more patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, if your plants are going to be done at
week eight on the package, let them go to
[SPEAKER_00]: week nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe let them go to week 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rule of thumb is when you think it's
ready, let it go another week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants, if it's the first time
you're growing it, those plants may show
[SPEAKER_00]: you something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be involved in the next
question that I ask also.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you let those plants go that last extra
week, maybe two weeks, you may see things
[SPEAKER_00]: you would have never seen in that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe at the last 10 days, it turns
amazing colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe in the last five days, it really
beefs up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe in that last week or two,
it really puts on amazing amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes and potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the flavor changes completely from
grapefruits to orange rinds in the last
[SPEAKER_00]: week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you just got to let it go and see
what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let it go that full eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we write eight weeks on the package,
we mean eight weeks from the day you put
[SPEAKER_00]: it into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not mean that you can harvest on the
first day of the eighth week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to finish that eighth week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to cut down the first day of
the ninth week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another piece of advice is wait
longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think it's ready, wait another
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the seed pack said eight weeks,
give it nine, maybe give it 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're not going to degrade that
product too much by letting it go a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit longer, but you can really miss
opportunities by not going long enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my rant on eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I had that conversation with my
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of mixed in a couple of details in
there from a couple of conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope I answered a couple of questions for
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope I solved some problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm going to recap that when I say
eight weeks of flower, I mean eight weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: from the day you turned the lights to
1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also mean a full eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that 56 days?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I want you to get 56 full days of
flower in there, not 49.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to cut it down at the
start of week eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to harvest at the end of week
eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to say you could do it with
my seeds as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If my seed pack says it's done in eight
weeks, give it nine, give it 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way the next time you grow it,
you can do it even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time you grow it, you're not
going to need to get it perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about that here in
this second question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want their names said.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not have their name listed here on
the email, but this one comes from a
[SPEAKER_00]: listener and it says a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have an episode on when to flush?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I have done an episode on
flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't recall the number right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll drop the number right about here on
the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll also put a link in the show notes and
you can link right to the flushing
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for stepping over my new tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a flushing episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not remember the number.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put the link in the video
description, but it says I know how to
[SPEAKER_00]: flush, but how can I tell when to start
flushing?
[SPEAKER_00]: If a seed pack says 60 days, should I just
start a week or so before then hope it's
[SPEAKER_00]: done around 60 days?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says he knows how to flush,
but I'm going to cover Really briefly on
[SPEAKER_00]: how to flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really easy method.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really easy technique before I get
there Let me cover one thing that I know a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people are going to start saying
Flushing is bro science flushing is
[SPEAKER_00]: pseudoscience flushing is not necessary
There is a lot of controversy in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis environment right now talking
about flushing There's a very popular
[SPEAKER_00]: famous author who went out and said that
flushing is highly unnecessary that we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't need to do it There are a lot of
other people that say we should be
[SPEAKER_00]: flushing our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a scientist I have not gone to
school for that sort Of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't give you a definitive scientific
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can give you the Rasta Jeff bro science
opinion Get ready for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm my email box is open.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm waiting to hear back from you Here is
my opinion on flushing when we are using a
[SPEAKER_00]: super soil type of medium an organic
environment flushing may not be as
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary as when we are feeding our
plants chelated and buffered nutrients I
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like the plants can kind of
selectively take up nutrients when they're
[SPEAKER_00]: in that organics, but I feel like they're
kind of being forced Fed more stuff more
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients when we give them the chelated
nutrients So there may be some things we
[SPEAKER_00]: can possibly flush out of the chelated and
buffered plants They may be more necessary
[SPEAKER_00]: to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then something inside of me says what are
we trying to flush?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what are we actually flushing out?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're flushing out the main point of
flushing is to clean the root zone the
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere to remove all of the nutrients
the minerals the feeding the food from
[SPEAKER_00]: that root zone so that our plant will
Basically cannibalize itself and our
[SPEAKER_00]: theory is that without those nutrients in
the root zone the nutrients will not be in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant and then the plant should
Therefore burn better smoke better taste
[SPEAKER_00]: better and be a better overall product
once it's dried and cured and ready for
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption Part of me likes that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've been feeding these plants for
nine weeks I've been stuffing a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: shit into there and making them get big
and beefy, but hasn't all of that stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolized and turned into Bud matter and
leaf matter and it is now part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants It hasn't those are the small
building blocks that have been metabolized
[SPEAKER_00]: and turned into flowers leaves stems
trichomes Essential oils all of the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that are in that plant have been kind of
metabolized and converted So I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that we can actually flush
out a lot of that stuff I don't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: right equipment the education to actually
know what we're flushing out if we are
[SPEAKER_00]: flushing anything out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know A hundred percent that it is
necessary I do know that we had a crop
[SPEAKER_00]: that was ran of concentrates that some of
the plants never got flushed We didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: realize that the harvest time was coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was an issue plants got harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got turned into concentrates We had
no hint that there were nutrients bad
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors bad aromas in that concentrate the
concentrate was fucking tremendous But I
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't done the side-by-side With just
cutting down a crop without flushing it
[SPEAKER_00]: and cutting down a crop that has been
flushed drying and curing them
[SPEAKER_00]: side-by-side and smoking them I personally
have not done that test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am in the habit of flushing so now That
is kind of my rant on the pseudoscience
[SPEAKER_00]: the question the controversy of flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that it is necessary I like
to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow with salt salt based nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find it advantageous to flush because I
think I may be cleaning something out,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then I ask myself the question What
could I possibly be cleaning out those
[SPEAKER_00]: things have become plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're buds now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm not gonna wash out Calcium out
of the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not I didn't pour the bottle of
Kalmag into the bud The Kalmag went into
[SPEAKER_00]: the solution which went into the roots
which got converted metabolized turned
[SPEAKER_00]: into plants through photosynthesis I don't
know that I can flush that Kalmag out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know that is that's the
pseudoscience now Let's talk about how to
[SPEAKER_00]: flush flushing is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm in the habit of flushing
I've been taught to flush for the last 10
[SPEAKER_00]: to 14 days of my flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked it because it's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Really easy task to do and if it
does improve our gardens, I felt that it
[SPEAKER_00]: was something that was so easy to do I
should do it just in case it did work I
[SPEAKER_00]: may be missing the opportunity to give my
plants one two Maybe three more feedings
[SPEAKER_00]: over that 10 to 14 days But how much more
feeding can I give them?
[SPEAKER_00]: What more performance am I going to get
with one or two more feeds in that last 10
[SPEAKER_00]: or 14 days?
[SPEAKER_00]: So flushing is free the way that I flush
the way that I recommend to flush is to
[SPEAKER_00]: simply water your plants as normal So if
the last eight weeks of your plants you've
[SPEAKER_00]: been watering and getting 20% runoff But
you've been adding nutrients when you
[SPEAKER_00]: begin to flush what I would do is water to
20% runoff But I simply do not add
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that easy If you pour a gallon of
nutrient and water through your plant on a
[SPEAKER_00]: watering day When it comes time to flush
pour a gallon through there and don't add
[SPEAKER_00]: any nutrients you are now flushing The
plants are the water is going to run off
[SPEAKER_00]: the excess nutrients in your soil in your
soil in your cocoa That's all going to run
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be in your runoff Test it's in
your runoff water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not in the rhizosphere anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are now technically you are flushing
now Don't think that you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: completely drain and flood your your pot
every time you flush Just a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: runoff every time is sufficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna do this for 10 14 days So
you're probably gonna get two three Maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: four or five waterings depending on your
cycles your pot sizes the room So you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna get a couple of waterings to just
rinse them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just don't want to give them nutrients
So just water them until you get Ten to
[SPEAKER_00]: twenty percent runoff and do it every day
until harvest then I actually Don't do a
[SPEAKER_00]: flush or a water about three days before
harvest This kind of speeds them up and
[SPEAKER_00]: lets them get drying a little bit if you
need them to stay wet longer because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in a dry Environment water them
right before you cut them down think about
[SPEAKER_00]: that if you water them right before you
cut them They're gonna be a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more wet in your dry and cure area if you
let them dry on the sticks They're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: be a little bit drier in your dry and cure
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I flush For about 14 days with just
plain water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I will add some enzymes in there
Maybe sometimes I'll add a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: sweeteners or something But for the most
part I'm just going to be flushing for the
[SPEAKER_00]: last 10 to 14 days because it is free and
it could really improve the quality of my
[SPEAKER_00]: product Why wouldn't I do something that's
fucking free and could improve the quality
[SPEAKER_00]: now?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is controversy about pHing your
flush water I work in a large commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: environment a lot of times and I think it
would be an extra step To pH adjust the
[SPEAKER_00]: 500 gallon reservoir while we are flushing
The reason we pH the water is because
[SPEAKER_00]: plants uptake specific nutrients at
specific pH ranges If the pH range isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: within that area, the plants won't uptake
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that assists me in flushing that
rhizosphere I don't worry about flushing
[SPEAKER_00]: or I don't worry about pH when I'm
flushing because I don't want the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: to drink So not having a dialed-in pH they
will not drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm going for and they're
gonna start to look like shit You guys
[SPEAKER_00]: were gonna yellow them out They're not
getting any food or killing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're cannibalizing themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using all the nutrients that have
been stored within their leaves They're
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding themselves with that expect them
to start looking a little yellow a little
[SPEAKER_00]: crispy Don't be afraid to pull off those
excess leaves get that stuff out of there
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is how when and why I flush now
This one says how do I know when to flush
[SPEAKER_00]: if a seed pack says 60 days?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I start a week before and then just
hope it's done around 60 days?
[SPEAKER_00]: If the seed pack says 60 days I would go
70 Like I said in my previous rant You
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know what phenotype you've got the
breeder doesn't know what may be going on
[SPEAKER_00]: in your environment with your nutrients
You may have a phenotype that wants to go
[SPEAKER_00]: a few extra days Let it go that few extra
days and see maybe it'll do something
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll never know if you don't let it go
So if it says 60 days on the package my
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation is to let it go 70 days at
least 67 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it go that extra week I know that
sounds crazy because you're a grower that
[SPEAKER_00]: wants to get that Crop down you want to
get it harvested dried cured so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: either smoke it or make your profit off of
it But that extra week could really
[SPEAKER_00]: increase your harvest weight really
increase your potency It could make your
[SPEAKER_00]: product stand out to where you can
actually sell it for a little extra more
[SPEAKER_00]: money Or you can smoke it and enjoy it
just a little bit better So give it that
[SPEAKER_00]: extra week to 10 days the first time you
grow it just to see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my recommendation I always go a
little bit longer when I have a new strain
[SPEAKER_00]: just to see what it may do So if the
package says 60 days my advice go 67 to 70
[SPEAKER_00]: days Maybe even longer if you can risk it
if you can push it if you can hold back
[SPEAKER_00]: It's you that you got to do its patience
on your part.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the one in control of everything So
I would say go 70 days and then begin your
[SPEAKER_00]: flush at day 60 now take notes at this
time I don't know if you've got any clones
[SPEAKER_00]: of this I don't know if you're just
running one plant but run that 70 days and
[SPEAKER_00]: take notes see what it was like start
watching the trichomes around day 55 get a
[SPEAKER_00]: Loop check them out at 55 60 63 65 70 pay
really close really close attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: those trichomes then at day 70 cut it down
something to think about is Hopefully this
[SPEAKER_00]: is not your first date with this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not going to are not your last
date Sorry, I hear a weird noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm distracted by a weird noise in the
background I don't know what the hell it
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really hope it's not coming through the
microphone doesn't sound like it is but
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this is not your last date with
this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this is your first date So this
is your kind of you're just going out for
[SPEAKER_00]: dinner the first time getting a knower You
got to dial this plant in you've gone 70
[SPEAKER_00]: days Take three or four clones run like
four clones next time cut one down at day
[SPEAKER_00]: 60 one at day 63 one at day 65 and one at
day 70 Dry and cure them all the same
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke them See which one you desire the
most and then in subsequent grows cut them
[SPEAKER_00]: down at that day But people think that
this first time they grow this plant
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get it good, but the second third
fourth time you grow this plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when you really get it dialed in
That's when we really start getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: nuances of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start realizing Oh, it wants to go
64 days and the last two days it wants it
[SPEAKER_00]: really really cold and also around week
five It would have really liked it If I
[SPEAKER_00]: would have added a little bit more calcium
and gone a little bit lighter on the
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus Like you just got to grow them
a few times and learn them It's like
[SPEAKER_00]: taking this plant out on several dates
except your dates are real Really really
[SPEAKER_00]: long for like 90 day cycles for each date.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Hopefully this is not your last run
with this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just your first run.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to learn the plant You're gonna
learn a lot about it every time you grow
[SPEAKER_00]: it You're gonna see you're gonna have
things happen in the grow that tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: what this plant likes Maybe like right now
it's real cold If I've been running this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant in the summer several times and
never gave it the opportunity to get real
[SPEAKER_00]: cold I just happen to get negative 17
maybe I'm gonna see different things from
[SPEAKER_00]: my plants in my Garden because of that
negative 17 so run it a few times learn
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant see exactly what it likes Then
you'll know I got to get it real cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to give it a real high or real low
pH Just things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll learn them with different growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dial it in over time Then the next time
you grow it take multiple cuts of that
[SPEAKER_00]: same plant treat it all the same all the
way through the grow except flush harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: and dry and cure at different times and
then you can really tell the difference in
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're getting from your different
flushing harvesting drying and curing
[SPEAKER_00]: intervals, so I Know that doesn't sound
like the answer you wanted because you
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't want to hear that you should grow
to 70 days you wanted me to say at day 55
[SPEAKER_00]: flush it cut it down at 60 but From a
grower with a lot of experience somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: who's really looking to get the most out
of my garden I would run that plant for 70
[SPEAKER_00]: days and flush it at day 60 and see what
you get in the end Then on your second run
[SPEAKER_00]: do multiple clones of the same plant run
them at multiple different times 60 65 70
[SPEAKER_00]: see which one you like the best don't
worry that you're going to ruin the crop
[SPEAKER_00]: by going a little bit too long You can
start flushing At day 55 if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: just to be prepared and then keep an eye
on those trichomes If you think they're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting too amber then cut it down But I
don't think you're going to over ripen
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a nice window of ripeness you get
a few days It's not like you have to cut
[SPEAKER_00]: them at day 62 or you're gonna fuck it up
I run big commercial grows and we can't
[SPEAKER_00]: let One plant dictate the whole room the
room is coming down on March 17th And
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when it comes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a bunch of plants in there that
run nine weeks We do a nine week cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: March 17th will be the end of nine weeks
All of those plants are coming down some
[SPEAKER_00]: of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes should have probably came down around
March 14th Some of them probably could
[SPEAKER_00]: have come down around the 15th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them need to go till the 21st But
that's such a nice middle ground right
[SPEAKER_00]: there that I think all the plants come out
They're just they're not amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not fucking stellar But they're
just right to where all of the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: agree that that nine week mark works for
us So I'm the commercial grow they come
[SPEAKER_00]: down at nine weeks We don't fuck around
with that extra two or three days letting
[SPEAKER_00]: some shit grow cutting shit early We just
chop them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we start flushing about ten days before
there weren't cocoa So we only have to
[SPEAKER_00]: flush for about ten days put some enzymes
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cleans them out real good Anyway,
I'm getting off track my point Start
[SPEAKER_00]: flushing about 60 days take a lot of notes
Pay attention to how the plants react try
[SPEAKER_00]: them cure them See how you smoke it see
how you enjoy it the next time do multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars multiple cuts of the same plant
cut them down at different times at
[SPEAKER_00]: different intervals and see which one
works best for You or your clientele or
[SPEAKER_00]: customers whoever is consuming this
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: See which one they prefer All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am moving on to the next message This
one comes from a friend who uses the name
[SPEAKER_00]: um, actually They sent me another message
and said please don't use my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna skip their name We don't
want to say their name in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I read that I'm glad I remember
they sent me another message Anyway,
[SPEAKER_00]: this one says greetings from prohibition
land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey my friend Thank you for the great
message and thank you for listening And
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you for the passion you've got about
cannabis because this is a great message
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on and it says thank you for
always providing a great advice and
[SPEAKER_00]: suggestions on each and every podcast you
do I wake and bake Every morning with your
[SPEAKER_00]: latest premiere or an episode I have yet
to watch man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, bro You're probably hanging
out smoking a bowl right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you have a good day It keeps going it
says I swear I used the grow room setup
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes as a Bible with great success I
love hearing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you Way back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did some grow room setup episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's around episode 400 I believe 401 we
talked about setting up your grow and our
[SPEAKER_00]: friend has had great success I like
hearing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you Good job to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says my plants are happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're thriving and growing like a weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ha ha ha and then he said fuck that made
me laugh broke You need to smoke another
[SPEAKER_00]: bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, it says this brings me to the
email at the point of my email Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're getting to the point you guys it
says for over two years I've been growing
[SPEAKER_00]: with another gentleman in his garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: He and we have been very successful in our
adventures But now he is starting to use
[SPEAKER_00]: Eagle 20 and Abba Mekton as a preventative
measure Terrible products that would not
[SPEAKER_00]: allow recommend endorse condone or promote
the use of those products at all That's
[SPEAKER_00]: where this message gets good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says we've never had a powdery mildew
issue and little to no bugs in our garden
[SPEAKER_00]: But now he is starting to use but monthly
sprays We but we've never had any powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew and little to no bugs in our garden
so they're starting to use powder Eagle 20
[SPEAKER_00]: even though they've never had powdery
mildew or Any big bug issues it says
[SPEAKER_00]: monthly sprays a future death for the
consumers What the fuck I completely agree
[SPEAKER_00]: with you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not a good product That's not good
morals good ethics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna keep reading though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says what the fuck this has made me
start my own garden and leave his garden I
[SPEAKER_00]: hate to say problem solved but problem
solved man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can only worry about yourself You can
only do what you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to do his thing If you've
separated yourself from him, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing the right thing basically
problem solved But there is more it says I
[SPEAKER_00]: know that is bad shit real real Bad shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is real bad shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not good for the plants not good for
the environment not good for the
[SPEAKER_00]: Applicator not good for the consumer and
honestly not necessary for the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's much more to this It says him and
I have argued about using these chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot be a part of that My dilemma is
what to do with that knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to be a rat, but come on man
You can't be a rat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in this game This is a fucking game
where snitches get stitches.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot be a rat no matter what it's
about Snitching is snitching so you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: be a snitch You've just got to be the best
man that you can be about this situation
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's what you're doing You're
getting away from a terrible situation,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, someone's doing wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to be involved in it So
you've separated yourself from it in this
[SPEAKER_00]: type of situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably the best we can do There's
more though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says this is free market cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So testing is not required I'm gonna go
off on a rant here It makes me laugh when
[SPEAKER_00]: people say that they prefer black market
cannabis because you don't find powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew and you don't find pesticides In
black market cannabis, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't it wasn't tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you even know that there were
pesticides or Mold or whatever in your
[SPEAKER_00]: black market cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say y'all that dispensary weed is
moldy and doesn't pass testing Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: the black market stuff will too because it
doesn't have to get tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that's just my my side rant
We're gonna keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me find where I was I think I know
where you stand on these cancer-causing
[SPEAKER_00]: products But what would you do with the
knowledge of what he is doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna talk about that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Sorry for the ridiculous length of
the email, but having lost my parents
[SPEAKER_00]: grandparents and countless others to
cancer I feel pretty strongly about this
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a fucking understandable stance
right there, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that Thank you again Ross to
Jeff for the grow from your heart podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: without the podcast My big boy balls would
still be in my girls purse and I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have dared to expand my own garden I love
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I gave you the knowledge and
courage and Just the knowledge and courage
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess to get your balls out of the purse
and start your Own big boy garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like you got a cool lady also Then
it says from your friend and then he
[SPEAKER_00]: actually says you can use my real name
Nobody believes in real names anyways,
[SPEAKER_00]: then he backed that up with hey,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, my name is kind of unique Don't
use my real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not gonna use your real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll keep you safe here, bro Hopefully
your ex-gro partner doesn't hear this and
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't get upset with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um You know how I feel about this dude
Eagle 20 is a terrible product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the product that you listed here
mainly They got my attention Eagle 20 is
[SPEAKER_00]: banned In commercial cultivation in the
state of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is banned by the Colorado Department of
Agriculture for several reasons First of
[SPEAKER_00]: all, it does not go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the plants forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you put that on the plants it stays
Second of all, it's very toxic to the
[SPEAKER_00]: applicator and the consumer third If the
fire department has to come and the
[SPEAKER_00]: building is on fire They don't want us
having Eagle 20 in the building because
[SPEAKER_00]: when it burns it turns into cyanide gas,
which doesn't sound good to me At all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Eagle 20 is a very terrible product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you have to use Eagle 20 in the
grow You're being fucking lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said there are no powdery mildew or
bug problems What the fuck are you using
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew for if you don't have any
bug or mildew problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a lazy man's product This product
is designed for people who don't know how
[SPEAKER_00]: to adjust a VPD who don't know how to do
preventative maintenance who don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: how to set up a grow room and watch a
monitor and make sure that your VPD is in
[SPEAKER_00]: range This is just a lazy man's product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a greedy careless man's product
cannabis has been to make us feel better
[SPEAKER_00]: and We rely on our grower our cultivator
to produce a clean reliable ethical
[SPEAKER_00]: product By being a grower who sprays stuff
like Eagle 20 on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not being an ethical grower You're
being a greedy grower who is not thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about the health or well-being of your
consumer and most of the time cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: Salespeople hang out with the people who
consume their products you come by you sit
[SPEAKER_00]: on the couch You play some video games
smoke a couple bong rips together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You act like your friends You act like you
care about those people But if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying their medicine their product with
Eagle 20, you don't care about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are not their friend This is supposed
to be a medical product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care if you're smoking it
Recreationally or medically this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: medical product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes our body feel different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should make you feel better spraying
Eagle 20 on on a product you're giving to
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody To prevent cancer is bad karma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking greedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not thinking about your product
You're not thinking about your friends
[SPEAKER_00]: your customers your patient you were
thinking about your wallet and that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: fucked up way to go about cannabis Yes,
I run a cannabis business, but I give you
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow from my heart I teach you how to
succeed with the products that I do offer
[SPEAKER_00]: you I don't feel that there's a need for
laziness for greed for a big old ego for
[SPEAKER_00]: carelessness in the garden and those are
the things They come with applying Eagle
[SPEAKER_00]: 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big sign that says you don't care
about the people You don't care about the
[SPEAKER_00]: products and like I said a moment ago You
don't care about your friends and your
[SPEAKER_00]: community because these people come to
your spot and they probably take bong rips
[SPEAKER_00]: with you You probably hang out at the park
with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably know your family and friends
You probably know their family and friends
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you're gonna see them all start
coughing They're gonna start feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start changing colors weird symptoms
are gonna start popping up because they've
[SPEAKER_00]: been smoking product that is tainted with
Illegal pesticides pesticides that I would
[SPEAKER_00]: not even allow in my grow in my home.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So um That's enough of a rant on the
terrible morals and shit laziness of your
[SPEAKER_00]: friend who calls themselves a grower They
are failing and they know it they're just
[SPEAKER_00]: being greedy So this is a good sign and a
good reason for you to just simply let him
[SPEAKER_00]: go You can if you want I'm not giving you
life advice, but I'm giving you life
[SPEAKER_00]: advice the way somebody does something is
the way Somebody does everything and if
[SPEAKER_00]: this guy is spraying bullshit on his
plants behind his customers back What else
[SPEAKER_00]: is he doing to you and your friends your
family and your customers?
[SPEAKER_00]: What other kind of morals and ethics does
this guy have that he's kind of bending
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're not looking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this somebody that you want to be
friends with is that somebody you want on
[SPEAKER_00]: your team?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you rely on this person as a friend or
are they just greedy with you and your
[SPEAKER_00]: friendship in your life?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, so he's also doing more filthy shit
to his customers And to his friends and to
[SPEAKER_00]: you that you don't know about is my
assumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't prove that I don't know that I
don't know the dude, but most of the time
[SPEAKER_00]: the way somebody does something is the way
somebody does Everything and if he's doing
[SPEAKER_00]: this shit greedily selfishly lazily
Without care.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how he's probably going to do a lot
of things and that will continue Through
[SPEAKER_00]: his life and that will also spill into
your friendship your relationship and your
[SPEAKER_00]: future Now don't let this guy bring you
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't attach yourself to him business-wise
because Once the clientele finds out that
[SPEAKER_00]: he's been spraying shit on it if you're
still attached They're going to think that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he will He will rid himself of his own
problem his clients will realize that
[SPEAKER_00]: something's wrong with the product or What
will happen is you will get the good cut
[SPEAKER_00]: the good clientele people can tell who's
got the good vibes Who's got the good
[SPEAKER_00]: scruples the good morals the good ethics
and they can feel that in you and they can
[SPEAKER_00]: feel that in him And if you guys divide as
team members if you guys divide as six
[SPEAKER_00]: People I don't know your dynamic but if it
is divided and it is kind of it becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: known amongst your community that it has
been divided People will see that that has
[SPEAKER_00]: happened people will make their own
thought processes and they'll say you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what this guy seems like a good guy He
must not be hanging out this guy over here
[SPEAKER_00]: for a reason That guy will end up with all
of the fucking nefarious customers all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the riff-raff all the shithead customers
will end up over there You'll have all the
[SPEAKER_00]: good clientele all the good customers all
the good people that care about each other
[SPEAKER_00]: They care about karma.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll have all the shitheads over there
All the people that you kind of needed to
[SPEAKER_00]: distance yourself from anyway,
they'll all go there This may be a
[SPEAKER_00]: blessing in disguise or as my friend Saul
says could be a blessing in the skies
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you want to say it?
[SPEAKER_00]: But this may be The thing that you needed
to separate yourself from some bullshit
[SPEAKER_00]: before you got too deep into some bullshit
Now you can get away get out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can start your own thing now You
don't have to split the profit with
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody else Maybe that's the route to
take and You've got the good karma the
[SPEAKER_00]: good customers let him deal with the bad
karma the bad customers Let that be the
[SPEAKER_00]: way that you deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't don't think about being a snitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do anything like that But just ask
your friends if they notice, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what do you think of my herb compared to
his you notice any taste difference?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you could say shit like that to
your friends, but don't go stir in the pot
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be careful or maybe just get your new
customers your new friends and just carry
[SPEAKER_00]: on The best way to succeed and the best
way to get revenge is just be fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't even waste your time On that
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't look back Just be you do your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you're a good person.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you got a good heart It
sounds like you've got the right idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you already knew what to do
You just needed some guidance and some
[SPEAKER_00]: affirmation from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you go, my friend You're doing
the right thing things are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: great for you because you're following the
karmic way You're doing things the iry
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
