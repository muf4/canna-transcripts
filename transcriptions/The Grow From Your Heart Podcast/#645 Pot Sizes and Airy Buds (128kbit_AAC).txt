[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a beautiful day today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it was beautiful wherever you are,
wherever you were hanging out with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you were doing, I hope you had a
wonderful day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about this weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: This weather had people out and about.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are getting ready for their outdoor
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to the Grow Store today and the
Grow Store was super busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a lot of people in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people were wearing masks,
some people not wearing masks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said masks, weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, some people seem to have decided
that the pandemic is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are still participating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going down that avenue in this
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just notice that people are crowding the
stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Places are getting busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the Grow Store, one thing I did notice,
shit is out of stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not have a lot of the products I
went for.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't have the first choice products
I went for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always got a backup plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not have the soilless mix I
prefer to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not have the base nutrients I
wanted to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't have a pesticide I was looking
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were out of rapid rooters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was slim pickings at the Grow Store
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like all the B and C rate products
were on the shelf and all the A rate shit
[SPEAKER_00]: has been bought.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were waiting for trucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not know when shit was coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to another store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same story over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think all the shit was on the
same truck going to all of the Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: Stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're waiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shit is just not coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys have a backup plan is what I'm
getting at.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were out there shopping for grow
supplies, if you were stubborn about what
[SPEAKER_00]: you use in the grow, this is not gonna be
the season for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you're growing indoors or
outdoors, you're going to need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: flexible because this COVID situation,
the pandemic, the quarantine, all the
[SPEAKER_00]: weird shutdowns and shit have made
supplies scarce.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're harder to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to take you a little longer
to get the things you're sourcing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can even find your favorite
products, you may need to find a backup
[SPEAKER_00]: plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the second product, that thing you've
been wondering if it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now may be the time for you to find out if
that shit works, which could work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that's how you find out that
that other product is better or did
[SPEAKER_00]: something you didn't know it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you'll find some cool shit,
but have a backup plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you've got an outdoor grow
coming up, go get your shit now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't wait because shit is selling out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally the guanos were selling out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit was flying off the shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fish shit was gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the mammoth pee, all that shit,
it's all gone off the shelves right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys, at least in my location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get on it, get yourself some supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I was at the grow store,
I was asked a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did take a little bit of a note here in
my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not texting anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not hanging out on any chats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually reading a message on the
phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did take some notes at the grow store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got asked, can you explain why
transplanting a plant is a good idea?
[SPEAKER_00]: This person wanted to, they were
wondering, the word that I want to use is
[SPEAKER_00]: graduating the pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to just go from a paper towel
when they germinate their seed into their
[SPEAKER_00]: big seven gallon finisher pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were asking me why I recommend up
potting from a small container to a medium
[SPEAKER_00]: sized, maybe bigger, then into that seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do it a couple of different ways,
depending on the time, space, environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: the requirements for the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of different challenges
and things we would face here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they were asking how and why we would
go about doing different pot sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why wouldn't I just put my seedling,
this little tiny seedling into a seven
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon pot filled with soilless mix or
cocoa or whatever we've chosen to use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why can't I just go into the straight pot?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, but think about all of the water
it's going to take to water that big pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to use that much water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could put that seedling inside of a
little teeny tiny pot, and you only have
[SPEAKER_00]: to water that little section, which gives
you less opportunity for overwatering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have less space to
disrupt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to have to pour a gallon
of water in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just pour a little bit of water in
there and that seedling will get the water
[SPEAKER_00]: that it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that's that much less cocoa that you
have to use right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't need that much cocoa,
you don't have to buy that much cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to put a little seedling
in a big pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're not going to risk
overwatering.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's one of the main issues,
overwatering in that big pot will be easy
[SPEAKER_00]: because how much water, how much of that
big pot do I need to water?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to try to just water that
little space right there, but then the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots are going to grow and you're always
going to be chasing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start off, honestly, you've seen me do
my clones in a beer cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start off in a beer cup or a four or six
inch net pot is what I will start a
[SPEAKER_00]: seedling in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let it grow in there until it becomes
nearly root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it just pressing up against the
walls that I want the roots to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, it is time for some new shoes before
they get new shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another reason I like that is a faster
wet and dry time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like my plants staying wet for too
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like them, uh, not like dry,
but I don't want them soggy the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want there to be availability for oxygen
in that root space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they dry out a little bit,
there's room for error.
[SPEAKER_00]: When there's too much water in there,
the water takes all the space where the
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen would be in the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get as much air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think oxygen to the root space really
encourages root growth, happy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They eat more, they feed better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They perform better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a smaller pot gives me a little bit of
a faster wet and dry cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a smaller pot, that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I just want those roots to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want the plants to grow so I can get
them into their bigger pots sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got these little plants,
put them in a little cup, put them in a
[SPEAKER_00]: little pot, um, water them less often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're watering less space,
you're wasting less nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to mix up as much food.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to water a seven gallon
pot worth of space and only get the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have mixed up a little bit and
just watered that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think starting off small,
I would start with a cup, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would start with a cup and then work my
way into maybe a one gallon or a three
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that three gallon would either go
into a five or a seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do a cup or a one or a cup into a
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that one or the cup into the
three gallon or into the five gallon or
[SPEAKER_00]: the three gallon into a seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of just work my way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to go too big, too fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like them to grow in there and get a
little bit root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was saying I want them kind of pushing
the edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them, like if they were a size 13
shoe, I want them in a 12 and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I want to be like, Hey bro,
can I get my thirteens and then we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: upgrade them right when they're ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I take them out of the pot,
I kind of, uh, from the bottom,
[SPEAKER_00]: I put my fingers into the bottom of the
root zone and just spread it out a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit so that it looks like you just blew
the bottom of that plant right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people like, well, you just fucked up
your roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I pot it into the next pot,
that fucked up root section is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: the most explosive root section in that
whole pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That part's going to go, Oh, he gave us a
little opening because right now the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: are kind of tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're wrapped around inside that cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reached in there and pulled them apart a
little bit and gave them a little space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that space is where the roots are
going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to explode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I let them get a little bit tight in
their early pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want new shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're begging for new kicks before I put
them in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as they get their new kicks,
they take off running.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember when you gave a new little kid,
new shoes, or when you gave a little kid,
[SPEAKER_00]: new shoes, he thought he could run faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are going to do the same damn
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have less chance for overwatering.
[SPEAKER_00]: They dry down more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to water them more frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a quicker dry and wet time,
more feeding, more watering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A commercial grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let them get tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way when you up pot them,
they do go a little bit more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then here's another great thing in micro
space, uh, in a commercial environment or
[SPEAKER_00]: in most places where we aren't super
limited by numbers, uh, space is valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I've got a little tiny plant that
is six inches tall in a seven gallon pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I'm going to guess is about 18
inches in diameter, I am wasting a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can put those plants into smaller pots
and I can push them together much closer,
[SPEAKER_00]: which does a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought a lot more space, which means
I've got room for a lot more plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, keep in mind, those are going to get
up potted into bigger pots later and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll have to put them into the flower
room and they will take up more space.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're dividing room, rooms and
they're going multiple places,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need more room for more pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smaller pots while you can is not a bad
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you're taking up less floor space
with plants, that means we can probably
[SPEAKER_00]: turn off a couple of lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those plants are able to be moved over
to one side of the room and they all fit
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath two or three lights,
instead of running all six or eight lights
[SPEAKER_00]: in that room, you can save yourself that
much electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights are on for at least 18 hours a
day in this environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we got small veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want them on 18 six or more,
uh, running one or two lights at that rate
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to cost a little bit of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care if you're a commercial
environment, a home grow that will add up
[SPEAKER_00]: quite quickly because along with that
light, every light that's running,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a little bit of air
conditioning going.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably got a fan going.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every light adds more equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just think that you're paying for
that light.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the light runs, cause there's a fan
going with that light.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something that goes along with it
to keep it cool, keep it comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light creates heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to move the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we move the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We create humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get rid of the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many things happen because of that
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't just consider the cost of the
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's you're saving a lot of other things
when you turn off that light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, move those, those big seven gallon
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like 18 inches around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm, I'm guessing I'm a drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess they're about 18 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at 18 inch floor Tom next to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, probably about 16, 18 inches around a
three gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think is about 12 inches around.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at that in a grow room,
you can fit, uh, three to four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three gallon pots and the space of two
seven gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So save you a lot of room, move them
closer together.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing one gallon pots and get a
bunch in there, uh, don't cram the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in so tight that they're pushing on each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them space.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm saying don't waste a bunch of
space in your grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I would start with smaller
pots, uh, start off in a cup or a one
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon pot or a net pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as soon as it starts to get tight
in there and that plant's getting a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit bigger, that's when I put it into my
next pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it has gone officially.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my labeling system from small veg to
it's veg, the Tative stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's actually in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's vegging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not small veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next stage is like,
we're about to flower these bitches.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when they get lollipop and cleaned
up and start getting really worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, yeah, transplant them that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can save yourself space, save
nutrients, save water, save soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can save lighting by pushing the
plants closer together by saving lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're saving electricity by saving
electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were saving a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think I covered that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a pretty good ramble on for,
uh, what was meant to be just a really
[SPEAKER_00]: quick topic there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, graduated pot size.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do encourage you to work your way up
from a smaller pot to a bigger pot to your
[SPEAKER_00]: final destination pot, which you do choose
to flower in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you don't want the plants to get root
bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they do get root bound, some plants may
panic on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may start to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll stop feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they'll look really pissed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, why are these plants doing
this weird shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to go into a bigger pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you up pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I up pot, uh, I like to
sprinkle a little bit of microbe product
[SPEAKER_00]: either around the roots of the plant that
I'm potting or into the hole in which it
[SPEAKER_00]: is getting potted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I pull that pot, that plant out of the
pot, the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I can see my white roots on the
outside of that dirt, just holding all
[SPEAKER_00]: that dirt together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get a root product or a micro product
and just dust the outside of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just sprinkle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll turn that pot with my hand,
just spin it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just use a little cup and just
sprinkle some of the microbes on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I pot it on there,
there are already microbes on that root
[SPEAKER_00]: zone telling those roots, Hey bro,
go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life is going to be good in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you put some water on it,
all that shit activates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants go shebang.
Kapow.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I talked long enough about that
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me read an email that I've got here in
front of me, or this podcast is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get out of control long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, big shout out to all my friends at the
grow store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good time hanging out at the grow
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for if I seemed rude because I
was in a hurry today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was simply in a fucking hurry today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to get a lot done and they
didn't have what I needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that meant I had to go to more stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't trying to be rude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had shit to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is not the one I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this the message I need?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the message I need right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for clearing the throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, Hey Rasta Jeff,
before my question, I just wanted to shout
[SPEAKER_00]: you out and thank you for all you do for
the grow community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the show because other podcasts
don't say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't stay informational and they can
be hard to consume and they're time
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming and it's hard learning this
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the straightforward info and down
to business approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's a great compliment that I try
to, I try to stay on subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to stay on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I do got the ADD and I also try to
have fun, but I also try to include you
[SPEAKER_00]: and make you feel like you're hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can almost pass you the joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had a joint right here, I could
almost want you to feel like you're right
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can almost smell the smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to hanging out with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you feel like you're,
uh, learning from me and I'm glad you feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like I stay on point and, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I stay informational.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to talk about the comedy shows I
used to go to and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I talk about what I do,
but I try to talk about just growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: not, not talk too much about myself on the
show now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but I do want you to feel like you're
hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we are, we are friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let me get to the point here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says my question and thank you for the
compliments, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says my question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running a nine by seven tent with two
1000 watt Mar Mars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydro TS lights, uh, carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some details in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing at three, five and seven
gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally only running three to five pots
at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only use Fox farm ocean forest,
and I always grow 100% organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using down to earth, dry fertilizers
and bat guano.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also had fish shit every feed as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got the down to earth, dry Fertz,
uh, bone meal, uh, bat guano and fish shit
[SPEAKER_00]: every feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, each of my first five grows has taught
me new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how to solve different problems,
uh, the grow might have that is,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, that's a great thing to notice that
every grow, you've solved a problem and
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of your grows are going to be problem
free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every grove is going to have some sort of
obstacle or hurdle and issue to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's learning to deal with those obstacles
and eliminate them and not go into panic
[SPEAKER_00]: mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen growers, I've done it myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see an issue and you go, Oh shit,
there's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the alarms go off in your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: You fucking pull the rip cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to do all this dumb shit to solve
the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: When really all the all you needed to do
was go take a dab or go smoke a fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: joint and really think clearly about how
to fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd went, Oh, you know, as a dumb
problem, I can solve this overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get panic mode so quickly
because you realize that these plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: fixable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Problems are solvable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as you're learning something
with every girl, you're making great
[SPEAKER_00]: progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me find my spot here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: My spot in this message says, uh,
but I seem to be lacking in the nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge and the dry and cure stage
because before harvest, the plants smell
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing and have a nice, dense
consistency, but after dry and cure,
[SPEAKER_00]: the buds are airy and light and have no
density.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there are a few things that can be
causing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it could be a lot of stuff adding up
to cause that it goes on to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have yet to have my product smell or
taste even close to what it's like before
[SPEAKER_00]: I chop them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a couple ideas why that's happening
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've listened to your dry and cure episode
and other reliable sources, but I seem to
[SPEAKER_00]: not be able to translate that knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I soak up into physically and visually
understanding this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a hygrometer in the dry and cure
area, but unfortunately I'm not able to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep that area a hundred percent dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dark isn't a hundred percent crucial,
but I do keep the humidity under 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try to get that to about 50 or 60%
and make your product take just a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit longer to dry may help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, what could be the main reason for my
airy buds and loss of aroma?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again, Rasta Jeff, for all the
information and time you have given.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you give every day to home growers,
learning, uh, one love from, and then I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not sure if they want their name said,
we're just going to call them Kyle today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Kyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great message,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have some answers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think I can help you out a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me start with the disclaimer because I
like to do this, uh, organic growing is
[SPEAKER_00]: not my specialty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I straight up am a bottled nutrient
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow with new millennium bottled
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I add some products from veg
bloom or hydrangea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, hydroponic research is the company,
but most of what I'm growing is
[SPEAKER_00]: non-organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a salt based grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I find it easier in a commercial
environment to train a crew, to write a
[SPEAKER_00]: standard operating procedure, to have
repeatable results by using bottled
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the sustainability, but the way I
know how to grow the goal for my
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial facilities that I'm hired to
help with the goal that the owners have,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, I think that a bottled nutrient system
is the way to go for my style.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's repeatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand how to make it
repeatable and sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand how to make it
trainable for a crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to write down instructions that can
be done by anybody when I'm gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think organics, uh, there are a lot of
variables that we would have to have some
[SPEAKER_00]: hands on experience and some eyes to think
about a little bit too much with the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say 20 of this, 50 of this, 20 of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time we feed it, it is the same
thing with organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get some variables in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this is my thought process on the
whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I'm not an organic grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That part is not my area of expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes to your nutrient
knowledge, uh, lacking, I as well am
[SPEAKER_00]: lacking nutrients knowledge in this
department because I don't do the organic
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand the elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand the way the plants feed,
but I'm doing it a little bit differently
[SPEAKER_00]: than you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I may not have all of the answers when
it comes to the nutrient part,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, um, also I'm not sure if that is
enough light in this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure of the spread of that light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be enough light, but what I'm
learning about LEDs is they don't spread a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need more spread on these LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not complaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying that's what I'm learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm wondering if you've got like one
section with a lot of light and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of the room, isn't getting a lot of
light because that'll help, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: more light spread around more proper light
would help with intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would help with bud density is what I'm
getting at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing I would recommend to start
with, and I don't know that this is doing
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am, uh, I'm guessing and assuming based
on the information I've got, I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: give useful information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you trellising?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you using a net to hold down the main
tops?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got one top that's sticking up,
that light is hitting this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about this before that buds
getting really hot, but the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants down here, aren't getting the
intense light that they could trellis this
[SPEAKER_00]: one down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the light will hit all of the buds
and all of the buds will have a chance to
spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't have tops that are real nice,
real tight, uh, kind of good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then bottoms that are shitty or you'll
have a bunch of decent buds at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, maybe they'll tighten up for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do that, that's just one idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I was looking at your nutrients a
little bit, maybe a kelp product in there
[SPEAKER_00]: would help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know when you're feeding what,
but I know that kelp products do help with
[SPEAKER_00]: stank and density.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, in my experience,
a kelp product would help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are plenty of organic kelp products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which you can mix into your soil to begin
with, or you can find a liquid kelp
[SPEAKER_00]: product, which you can feed in later,
or you can find a kelp product that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can foliar feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you're trying to go organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to have to do your
research on those products, but that is a
[SPEAKER_00]: good start for those ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, airy buds is that that's probably grow
and cure related, but we're going to say
[SPEAKER_00]: it starts in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things that can be
giving you airy buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you tried multiple genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: The genetics have a lot to do with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing something, uh,
that's from a tropical environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's meant to be real airy because it
gets humid there and they need some air
[SPEAKER_00]: flow in those buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That bud naturally just is not going to be
real dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing some OG Kush,
some chem dog, and it's not getting dense,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is a room or a feed issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a problem there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so let's check the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I would check on then
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there enough light in that room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I'm not familiar with the Mars
hydro light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's enough,
uh, lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's enough wattage and
I don't know the spread on that light in
[SPEAKER_00]: that size of a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly don't know, but that's
something we can check on something.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could investigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the things on the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would eliminate to see if that is the
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there enough light?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I mentioned, do you have that one
bud right in the light?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that bud good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you trellising it down to get the
light everywhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you defoliating to get that light
further down into the canopy and get some
[SPEAKER_00]: light penetration that may help you out as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that does make, uh, fluffy buds
that will make the buds actually fluff out
[SPEAKER_00]: and become airy and be not as dense as
they could is environmental factors like
[SPEAKER_00]: too much heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, think about in the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when it gets too hot, you don't want
even in the summer, you don't want your
[SPEAKER_00]: own hands resting on your legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your hands get all sweaty where your hands
are resting on your legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to go, Hey, calyx stacking
on top of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just going to start spreading
and getting fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, when it gets too hot, they're just
trying to spread their legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not getting hot between their
legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like bro, it's too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to spread out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants are doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too humid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants feel funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of being dense, they're getting
fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, they know if they get too dense,
all that moisture will build up inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: those buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's too humid in there,
all that moisture will create a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get boy, try this or powdery mildew
inside of your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, heat, moisture, things like that
could be causing you problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a drastic diurnal swing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're getting, uh, too hot at night or
too cold in the day or opposite,
[SPEAKER_00]: or more than eight to 12 degrees change
from day to night temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: that can play a role in your fluffy buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing, the feeding, if you're not
feeding properly, if they're not getting
[SPEAKER_00]: the food that they need and they're not
getting the nutrients, uh, just imagine if
[SPEAKER_00]: you didn't eat proper food, you wouldn't
build up the way you needed to either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm a skinny dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I eat a pretty good vegetarian diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look like a stick figure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brock Lesnar is my height, but about three
times my width and density.
[SPEAKER_00]: He eats a totally different diet than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He eats a high performance, fucking high
protein, rip your head off, shit down your
[SPEAKER_00]: throat kind of diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants may be needing that Brock
Lesnar diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be giving them the Rasta Jeff
pasta and carbohydrate diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe it's diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read what you're giving them,
but I don't know exactly how much of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know exactly what's in all of
those products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may need to add a couple of things
to boost that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: A kelp product, maybe a bloom booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exact.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made the disclaimer, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly what you're doing
with these organic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what I'm doing with your
organic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be a feed issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I wrote down trellis, make sure you
get more, a more consistent canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about that, that even canopy
will help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way the light will get to all of the
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't have some dense, some fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call the fluffy buds, larf that stuff
on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's larfy crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually pinch that off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't even make it to the flower
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wants to trim that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's junk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, pinch that shit off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the light's not getting down there,
get that off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try to move some of the energy to
the actual bud part of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should make the buds tighter,
more dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that is what I think could be
happening during the grow that is making
[SPEAKER_00]: the aroma and the density lack in these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second part is probably, uh,
in the dry and cure process, something is
[SPEAKER_00]: happening during the harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, light degrades, terpenes, heat
degrades, terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are these plants getting too warm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you able to give them a period of dark
and cool for 12 to 24 hours before you
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest them?
[SPEAKER_00]: That may, that'll give you, so the
overnight while the plants are sleeping in
[SPEAKER_00]: the dark and the cool, they will produce a
produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: That word came out really weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I get some comments on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of terpenes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll produce turps all night long while
they're sleeping in that cool,
[SPEAKER_00]: dark environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start turning on lights and heat,
those turps start getting, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: they start volatizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start getting, uh, degrading.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start getting destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can get it cool and dark in
there for a while, build up as many turps
[SPEAKER_00]: as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give yourself a head start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole time you're drying and trimming
it, try not to handle it too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, try not to touch it too much during
the trim process and the defoliation
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you might be drying too quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe let's slow down the drying process a
little bit, just a little tiny bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you're keeping it about 50%
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go about 60 and slow that drying
cure time down just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to smoke your product,
but you want to smoke a better product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that dry and cure room cold enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's colder, the buds will get tighter
as they dry up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not cold enough, they're not going
to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, is it too dry in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it too hot in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it too hot in the drying cure room?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to fuck up your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there wind in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: The wind could be blowing your buds,
just dry and drying them right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just blowing the turps right out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about when you ride a motorcycle or
if you go out on the boat or if you hang
[SPEAKER_00]: out on the wind all day, your lips are all
chapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking your skin feels all dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants, if they're in the wind and
hanging and drying in the wind,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if there's too much airflow in the dry
room, they're doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All your turps, all your moisture,
it just got sucked right out of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why your herb smells like hay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really think that slowing down the
drying and curing process could help you
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go a little bit slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not getting, um,
like a, an ammonia, um, an acrid pissy
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of aroma, you're not, uh,
trapping too much moisture in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not sealing it up too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think that you're not ruining
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not giving, you're not getting the
opportunity to ruin it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it may just be drying too quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: For you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so I would check all of the things we
talked about in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, is there proper lighting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you taking care of the genetics,
the trellising, the heat, the feed
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity is the lights, air, water,
soil, the laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: L A W S you guys, have you thought about
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I taught you that, I think I learned it
from sub cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give somebody credit because I
think it's, uh, it's polite and important
[SPEAKER_00]: for a teacher to give credit where you
learn shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't learn everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't make it all up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I learned laws, lights,
air, water, and soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I learned that from sub cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you following all of the laws?
[SPEAKER_00]: If all the laws are in line, then let's
check out the dry and cure tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may need to just slow it down a little
bit, increase the humidity, lower the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature may help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get it slowed down just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: My last note on this subject is where are
you drying and curing this product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing it in the basement?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing it under the grow lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is this happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you dry and cure your product in a
funky scented basement, your product will
[SPEAKER_00]: get funky basement turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you're drying it in the bathroom,
it's going to pick up bathroom turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that may be something that's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so for tighter, more dense,
more aroma, I'm really thinking it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a slower dry and cure at a lower
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, maybe send me some pictures of the
plants right before you cut them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me some pictures of your harvest
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know how you're harvesting,
drying, and curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and maybe I can give you some more
advice, more guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we can give the listeners a little
bit of a follow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Kyle, I hope I answered your
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I gave you some useful info.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm not an expert in the organics,
so I wasn't exactly sure where to start,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I feel like we got you a little bit,
a little bit of info to get you moving,
[SPEAKER_00]: some stuff to check on, some adjustments
to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do look forward to the update.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
pimps and hoes, friends, foes,
[SPEAKER_00]: smokers, growers, clone cutters,
pollen, chuckers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening to this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody out there has any grow
questions, I would love to answer those
[SPEAKER_00]: questions on the show for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email address is grow from your heart
at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I've got a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: My website is I read genetics.com on that
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a tab that says grow help.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you click on that grow help tab,
you'll be taken to a little questionnaire.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ask you nine or 10 questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very basic question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of whites are you using?
[SPEAKER_00]: What strain are you growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing indoors or outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the basic shit that will help me
answer your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I get some details about your
grow can build a, can paint an image of
[SPEAKER_00]: your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way when it comes time to answer the
question, all the details I need are right
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you hit that grow help tab,
answer a few questions at the bottom,
[SPEAKER_00]: it says, explain your problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply tell me what the fuck is wrong with
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do my best to answer your question
thoroughly here on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate all of the listener
interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this lets me know that I'm helping
somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that we at least helped Kyle today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're helping Kyle, there's
probably somebody else out there with the
[SPEAKER_00]: same question, the same problem,
just a numbers game.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one person asks, there's probably a lot
of people out there that I can help with
[SPEAKER_00]: the same question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do appreciate the listener generated
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like this episode was
educational, informative, or entertaining,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you'd just like to throw me a couple
of bucks because I made you giggle or
[SPEAKER_00]: taught you a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you have to do is visit www.patreon

[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is all I've got for you for
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm just running out of camera
time as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a good time to wrap up this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back in just a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a big shout out to my
