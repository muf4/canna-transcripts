[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the show by
talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I've been taking dabs of Malibu Pure
Kush Ambrosia from Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label on the package says that this
product contains 72.9% THC and 84.7% total
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to crack it open and give you a
fresh smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells gassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells earthy, and it smells funky,
and this is one of my favorite aromas,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of my favorite flavors, and I for sure
love these stony buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me nice and relaxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me nice and mellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of jello here in the chair while
I'm recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just chilled out, not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got my shoes off, nice and comfy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friends at Apothecary
Farms for the delicious Malibu Pure Kush
[SPEAKER_00]: Ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, in this episode I am going to

[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I've got one more thing I want
to talk about and give thanks for before I
[SPEAKER_00]: move on to the email portion of this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: But last week was my birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunday was officially my birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been having an amazing birthday
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out, big thanks to all of my
friends who've been spoiling me and
[SPEAKER_00]: spending time with me and hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure I'm having a smile on my face
and well fed and heavily medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been a great week, but the birthday
week has continued.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has not slowed down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has not stopped yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Wednesday, I was hanging out doing my
chores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got a phone call from an unfamiliar
number.
[SPEAKER_00]: I answered it and they said, is this Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, that's me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, hey, it's this guy from
ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say his name,
but he said, it's me from ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know why I'm calling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, oh shit, did you guys get me
tickets?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, happy birthday,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got you two tickets for Tom Segura
tonight at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live about two hours from ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to regroup my day, rearrange my
plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: That didn't take much effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I knew that my next mission was to
call Clint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And make sure that Clint could get off of
work early so that we could travel up to
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I made the quick call.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, Clint, bro, I've got a major
emergency.
[SPEAKER_00]: ComedyWorks just called.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got two tickets to see Tommy Segura
tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love for you to be my buddy for
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, I'll be there, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Clint showed up to my house around
3.30.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allegedly, we may or may not have gotten a
little bit medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made the adventure up to Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traffic was kind of a little bitch that
night, but we made it right on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to be at the parking lot at 6.30.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were there at 6.28.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may or may not have taken a gigantic dab
in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we made it into the ComedyWorks
venue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were given amazing seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to all of my friends at
ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: ComedyWorks is, in my opinion,
one of the best two comedy clubs on the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they treat me like a VIP rock star
every time I go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all remember my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: They greet me by name.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have a smile on their face.
[SPEAKER_00]: They remember what I order when I get
snacks and drinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to that club for taking
such good care of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to ComedyWorks for calling
me with tickets for my birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was super awesome and super kind of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also big shout out to Clint for being
able to get off work a little bit early
[SPEAKER_00]: and make it to an awesome comedy show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tom Segura made it clear that he did not
have a lot of new material.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just put out a comedy special.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's got an hour of brand new material
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's available on Netflix really soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to watch that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when a comedian puts out a special,
they don't do that material anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like old shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to go to the comedy club
and see the special that you just watched
[SPEAKER_00]: on Netflix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he is working on a brand new hour of
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he stopped at the ComedyWorks in
Denver to run some of his new jokes by us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of his new material is fucking
hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of jokes were kind of duds,
but it was even funnier watching Tom
[SPEAKER_00]: Segura throw out a joke that was kind of
like, that needs work, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he would look at the crowd and be
like, is there something there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just real funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a small club.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can see all of our faces.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real intimate experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to Tom Segura for dropping into
the ComedyWorks on a Wednesday night just
[SPEAKER_00]: to come run some new material by us and
see if it was funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, that shit was funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, let's give a big shout out to Adam
Clayton Holland for being an amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: opening act.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude crushed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does a bit about Guinness beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to blow any of the bit,
but that bit is fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, if you happen to hear this,
I was laughing until I was pissing my
[SPEAKER_00]: pants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you do the bro and the dude
voice, bro, that could be me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be doing my voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was fucking funny to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also, I want to give a big shout out
and a thank you to Brant Tobler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brant Tobler is an amazing comedian.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's from Cheyenne, Wyoming.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is now based in Denver, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's at ComedyWorks Local, a ComedyWorks
regular.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does a lot of works with the
ComedyWorks crew, a lot of opening work
[SPEAKER_00]: there, a lot of headlining work.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also got a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to everybody who performed
on the stage that night.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all did an amazing job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I cannot tell you how exciting
it was to get a call from somebody saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, bro, we got you two tickets to see
Tom Segura tonight because that show sold
[SPEAKER_00]: out in about 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got an email saying, Tommy's going to go
on sale today at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you've got your computer ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was clicking and clicking and clicking
and clicking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time I got through it,
tickets were sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was really blessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt really privileged to have gotten
tickets to that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a fucking good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to quit bragging about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a dab and then let's read some
emails from our listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm going to press pause so you
don't have to listen to the torch and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that bullshit, but I am going to take a
big fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I get back, we are going to read
some emails from some listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dab something, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is what it sounds like in my head
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a ridiculous dab of the Malibu
Pure Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of feels like I am swimming
underwater while I'm sitting here at this
[SPEAKER_00]: table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feels like I put a little, like I cemented
my face down.
[SPEAKER_00]: My eyes are super heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: My arms are super ridiculously heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of wish I had a seatbelt on my
chair right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm going to be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to move forward to the email
portion of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody out there has a cannabis
culture or cannabis cultivation question,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first email on today's episode goes
just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am on day 60 of flower with orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants look and smell amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is, does day one of flowers
start the day you flipped at 1212 or when
[SPEAKER_00]: you see the first flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: My next grow will be Lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not sign their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they want their name set
on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get this question a lot, so I will try
to answer it very clearly right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you are working in an indoor
environment, day one of flower is when you
[SPEAKER_00]: flip those lights to 1212 or whatever
desired flowering cycle you are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you start counting day one of
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I've recommended 60 to 70 days,
that is when the day one begins is when
[SPEAKER_00]: you change the light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most cases, you're not going to see any
flowers or preflowers until around day 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: 12, 14, maybe a little bit further.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start counting that as day one,
you are already 10, 12, or 14 days behind
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are way off.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of your feed charts are going to
match.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of the recommendations I make are
going to match.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day one is when you flip those lights to
your 1212 or your 1113 flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wrap this message up by saying my
next grow will be Lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to that one as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to see pictures of the orangegasm
and the Lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can send them to me at
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do look forward to those photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's keep this show moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next email in today's episode goes
just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Rasta.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the bounty of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening and for all of the
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recognize your name here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say I have started
collecting and popping your seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that you're popping the seeds and I
really love that people are collecting the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and the genetics that I have made
and created.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not know that would be a thing when
I started making seeds for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know when I put packages out that
people would stash them and hoard them and
[SPEAKER_00]: try to collect all of them like Pokemon or
baseball cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I love that people are trying to catch
them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep going on the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says while I'm on a pheno hunt,
should I top?
[SPEAKER_00]: These first run seed plants or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: I normally top my clones two to three
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will I be affecting these seed plants by
topping them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I am looking for the best one,
but I'm thinking maybe I should let them
[SPEAKER_00]: go naturally during the pheno hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the pheno hunt, my plan was to top
thinking I could get more side growth for
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love your view on this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you from Scott from Clayton,
Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, big shout out to my new buddy Scott
out there in Clayton, Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about topping or
not topping our pheno hunt plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people may not understand what I'm
talking about when it comes to talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about topping and pheno hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do a little bit of a catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person has purchased a pack of seeds
and they're running the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know which of those seeds are
going to be the keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be a really stellar plant that
works really well for this person's garden
[SPEAKER_00]: or their medical condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a plant that you're looking
for, that plant may be in this package of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be genetic variation amongst
each seed in that package.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we run a seed pack for the first
time, our main goal with that first run is
[SPEAKER_00]: to find the keeper in that pack that works
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you do that by doing what is called a
pheno hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow your seeds, you take notes,
you take pictures, you document the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you harvest those plants and you
smoke them and you document which one you
[SPEAKER_00]: like the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully the one that grew the best for
you and produced the best and was the
[SPEAKER_00]: easiest to function and work with is the
one that smokes the best also.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is very rarely the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this person is going through the
process that we call a pheno hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to sprout their seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to veg them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they're going to flower them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they will dry them and cure them and
smoke them and they'll see which plant
[SPEAKER_00]: works the best for their needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they will probably eliminate the
remaining plants and keep that one plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to work with for the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way they can take clones from that
one plant and have reliable medicine over
[SPEAKER_00]: and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can develop a relationship with this
one plant and learn how much calcium it
[SPEAKER_00]: likes, how much potassium it likes,
exactly how long to flower it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can learn the quirks and ticks of each
plant by growing it multiple times and
[SPEAKER_00]: developing a relationship with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this person is in the process of
starting a pheno hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the other part of this question is do
they want to top their plants during a
[SPEAKER_00]: pheno hunt?
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know what they've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would like to see the full potential
of these plants and they don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: lessen or degrade the outcome of these
plants by doing any sort of experimental
[SPEAKER_00]: tactics to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So their question is should they top these
plants because a topped plant will produce
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: A topped plant will give you, if it's done
correctly and properly timed, a topped
[SPEAKER_00]: plant will give you more product,
more buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will also give you more branching
because this listener said they wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: top it to create more branching to get
more side growth for cloning, which does
[SPEAKER_00]: make great sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question here is do I top my pheno
hunt plants from seeds when I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm working with but I would still
like to see their full potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I did reply through email to this
listener because I did not want them to
[SPEAKER_00]: have to wait for me to put this podcast
together to get some useful advice out of
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I said was my quick answer is that if
you intend to top your plants in the next
[SPEAKER_00]: runs, top them as pheno hunters.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you generally don't top your plants in
the next runs, don't top them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Top them as pheno hunters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do top, top them because that's
what you're going to be doing in your
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to know if these plants work when
you top them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what you normally do,
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not what you normally do,
don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This advice only applies if you are
running a test garden for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are running a test grow for a
breeder such as myself or any other
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder who has gifted you seeds with the
intention of feedback, whether that's in
[SPEAKER_00]: the form of photos or grow reports or
maybe you smoke some of the finished
[SPEAKER_00]: product with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are running tester seeds for a
breeder, do not top them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not do any weird shit to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not do any weird experimentation on
tester seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put all of the test seeds in a grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them all the same environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them all the same treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the exact same thing to all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Veg them just long enough to make them
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower them out immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a lot of photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get those notes and photos to the breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get them dried and cured and finished up
as soon as possible so that you can smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: them so that you can give your breeder a
quality smoke report.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to find out if the seeds we
created are worth the shit and we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: know pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need them topped and twisted and
lollipoped and trellised out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need nine weeks worth of work on
a tester plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want that done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can veg for 30, 45 days then
flip them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a perfect world, my test seeds are done
in 90 to 120 days for a full cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you cut them down, dry them,
cure them, smoke them, send me reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are running a phenohunt for
yourself and you're looking for something
[SPEAKER_00]: that works well in your garden,
do to those phenohunting plants what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to do to them in your main
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to know how they're going to
perform under that environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those seeds you probably paid money
for and we know that they're reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know they're not hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know they're not a bunch of mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that there are going to be a good
ratio of males to females in those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those seeds, it is okay to dedicate
some time to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do some work with them if you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tester seeds, don't spend a lot of
time on them because we don't know if
[SPEAKER_00]: those are hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know if they're mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those could be all boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could just be trash genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what we have created when we
send you testers and we're relying on the
[SPEAKER_00]: testers to give us quality results and we
really don't want a wait eight weeks for
[SPEAKER_00]: you to veg a plant out and mainline it,
do all kinds of weird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we find out you only did two of
them and we sent you 20 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were really hoping you did 20 of them
side by side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just did them real small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do a lot of experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The experiment is are these worth the
shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to find out if they're any good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are two different types of
phenohunting environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: In both environments, I do recommend you
treat all plants the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are phenohunting and you feed this
plant one thing and this plant another,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do you know if that plant is better
and that plant is not better?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like giving me steroids and the guy
that I've got to fight, not giving him
[SPEAKER_00]: steroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to kick the shit out of him
because I'm on steroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you give both of us steroids,
it's still a fair fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't give either one of us
steroids, it's still a fair fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would never take steroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, I just picked a weird way to
describe that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you were doing phenohunts,
when you were doing testing, feed
[SPEAKER_00]: everything the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat every plant the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to lollipop one plant,
lollipop all of the other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to top one, top all of the
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do a phenohunt or testing,
keep it scientific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that all of the plants get the
same treatment so we get a reliable
[SPEAKER_00]: outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my point here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the short answer is if you're going to
top your plants in all of the future runs,
[SPEAKER_00]: top your phenohunters.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plan on letting them grow that one
glory bud, don't top them and see how they
[SPEAKER_00]: go with that one big glory bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And quickly, I'll tell you how I do
phenohunts and I do them in a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm trying to find a mother plant and I
know that I'm going to keep something
[SPEAKER_00]: around, I generally veg in three gallon
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I veg until they're about just a little
bit taller than my knee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a tall person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm six foot five, so my knee may be a
little bit taller than yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I veg until the plants are probably,
I'm guessing they're about table high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I veg until they're the height of this
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, I top them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take the main top out of the plant and
make a clone from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally clean up the bottoms of the
plants just a little bit before flower
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway, so I will take two clones off the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got three clones off of every
plant so that if I do find a keeper,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got three opportunities to keep that
bad dog around for future runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I veg my original plant to about knee
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take the top out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make a clone from that top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take two bottoms off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take two clones from those bottoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got that original big plant in a
three gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's about knee high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got three clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have got a decision to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want to flower that big plant or do
we want to flower the clones to find out
[SPEAKER_00]: what we've got?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are pros and cons to both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowering out that big plant, it's already
vegged out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already knee high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can flower that bad dog out and you
can get a nice amount of flowers off of
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant and it's already there,
ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can veg out those clones and you
can get those clones up to the right size
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can flower those out and those
clones will show you what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you flower out that big plant that
came from the seed, you've got a really
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy, big, vigorous mother plant that's
been cranking out lots of branches that is
[SPEAKER_00]: already ready to give you a bunch of
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people prefer to keep that seed
plant, the plant that came from the
[SPEAKER_00]: original seed, as their mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people prefer that as their keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: They keep that one around and take clones
from that forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people will run that big plant in
the flower room and finish it out because
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said earlier, it's already got a
lot of growth on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could flower it at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not put that bad dog in the flower
room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Flip it, get some product out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we've got three clones over here in
the cloner or in the clone dome that will
[SPEAKER_00]: become our keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, one out of three of those root.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not good at cutting clones,
maybe wait until you see roots on one of
[SPEAKER_00]: your clones before you put that big plant
to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only going to be 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can wait that long, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, now you've got three clones aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a big plant in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three of those clones are going to grow
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, the best one out of that will become
your new mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other two, you can either give them to
your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can share the genetics so the genetics
don't get lost or you can put those in
[SPEAKER_00]: your veg room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow them out, make them your next
flower run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you've got a mother plant and you've
got two vegging for your next flower run
[SPEAKER_00]: already.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to, you can cut clones from
all three of those to fill up the tray
[SPEAKER_00]: that you need and then you can have a full
room of that one select cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about making the decision on
which plant you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you really prefer to keep that seed
plant as your mother or are you okay with
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping that best clone as your mother?
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people in the cannabis world were
stuck on the idea of genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a podcast episode on the way
that we have been using the term genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: drift and what we thought it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not happening in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we don't have to worry about genetic
drift if we're trying to select a mother
[SPEAKER_00]: from a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to worry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your clones were properly cut,
if everything was healthy, that will not
[SPEAKER_00]: be an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I would personally use my clones as my
new mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would flower out that big plant since
it's already grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I determine if that big plant
is a male or a female, if it's male and I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't need male plants, I would pull that
male plant out of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get the pot out of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would allow more space for those females
to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, I would go and remove those
subsequent male clones from the tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, we cut three clones from each
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you remove plant number six,
you got to go find three clones that are
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled number six.
[SPEAKER_00]: All three of those need to come from the
dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want those around unless we do
intend to do some breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that is how I would do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that since we've already vegged
out that big plant, let's flower it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to waste all that time and
space getting that plant that big and then
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping it as a mother when we can keep a
clone as a mother when we don't even know
[SPEAKER_00]: if we've got a plant that we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not even be the phenotype we're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's flip it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what we've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one more little side rant or ending
rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's a tail rant to add to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say this one more time,
but always take a clone from every plant
[SPEAKER_00]: you grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are going to be very heartbroken if
you buy a pack of seeds, you run a pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and you find a phenotype from my
genetics that I have never seen before and
[SPEAKER_00]: I am blown away by it and you didn't even
take a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, before you put your plants into
flower, please just take one or two
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not really good at cloning,
make sure those clones have roots before
[SPEAKER_00]: you put your plants into flower so you've
got a genetic preserve of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow it out, and like I said
before, maybe it's that one plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: that one specific phenotype that cures an
ailment that has been bugging you for your
[SPEAKER_00]: whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you can just grow this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can roll it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, whatever has been bothering you,
it stops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a full hour, maybe two hours of
relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you have got a clone of that
because if you don't have a clone of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: all you're going to do is be chasing that
relief forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to know what it felt like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to try to buy more and more
packs of seeds in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's some rare magical phenotype,
you may not ever find it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to breed reliable, repeatable
phenotypes, but this is genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to find outliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you find that amazing outlier,
I can't promise you it will pop up in a
[SPEAKER_00]: pack of seeds again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the short version of that long ramble,
which I will blame on the Malibu Pirakush,
[SPEAKER_00]: is always take a clone of every seed you
sprout before you put it into flower
[SPEAKER_00]: because you never know if you have got the
next.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have the next Girl Scout cookies
or the next Tangy or you could have the
[SPEAKER_00]: next Gorilla Glue or whatever is popular
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next Gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have the next wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have the next hitter sitting right
there in your grow room and you didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: take a clone of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you do fail to take clones,
we can always revege.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've done a revege episode before.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, I will put one together so we can
talk about reveging keeper plants just in
[SPEAKER_00]: case we did not get a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Scott, I think I have more than
answered your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our buddy Scott D out
there in Clayton, Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all the support for the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any more questions,
dude, please send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love helping my friends out on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I do have one more email here
in front of me for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey there, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Brendan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a 20-year-old medical patient and
grower in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my new friend,
Brendan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pleasure to meet you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, You can use my name if this were
to make it on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said your name a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I've got your permission.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I started listening to your
podcast about two months ago and I really
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate all of the knowledge you have
given me thus far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have got a lot of catching up to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I can't tell you how much faster
time goes by in the cubicle when listening
[SPEAKER_00]: to the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
so shout out to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And white mic for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love hearing that I'm helping people
pass the day at a boring job.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while you're sitting there at work,
you are getting paid to become a better
[SPEAKER_00]: ganja grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate that, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the message keeps going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I have a quick question,
which I haven't heard you address in your
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast yet, unless I have missed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to be clear, this guy is growing
some feminized seeds from a reputable
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder, which is not iry genetics,
but he's got some iry on deck for the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the message goes on to say,
I just went into the garden and one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized plants, which is grown from
seed, has a few branches that showed sex
[SPEAKER_00]: within a day or two and have preflowers
while I have my lights on an 18-6 veg
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the possible causes and what
should I do with this plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever experienced this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love from Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay iry from Brendan.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Brendan, I think I have a
couple of ideas what could be going on in
[SPEAKER_00]: your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brendan has got some feminized seeds in
his garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are on an 18-6 light cycle,
which means they should be continuing to
[SPEAKER_00]: veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should not be flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, he has discovered that a
couple of branches have showed sex and
[SPEAKER_00]: preflowers while these plants are still on
the 18-6 light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he is curious what possible causes
could have caused this and what to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I really wish I knew how long these
plants had been vegging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really wish I knew how much light these
plants were getting and what type of light
[SPEAKER_00]: they were getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also really wish I knew what size
container and what type of soilless mix or
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa or soil you were working with and
also what they have been getting fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But without that information, I can give
you a few ideas of what could be
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number one guess, you may have auto
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot support or deny that claim in any
way, but they are flowering under an 18-6
[SPEAKER_00]: light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes me think maybe auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the only way to determine if they
are actually auto flowers is to keep an
[SPEAKER_00]: eye on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they actually going into full flower
or is that just a little bit of a tease,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a little bit of a preflower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they giving you signs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because earlier I said I wondered how much
light they were getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they getting enough light?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you've got them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got them on an 18-6 light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got too many plants crowded
in and they're not getting enough actual
[SPEAKER_00]: light on their leaves, they're not
absorbing enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of hours which that grow light
is on in your grow room won't make a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference if the plants are being shaded
by other plants, if they're pressed in too
[SPEAKER_00]: closely together, or if they're just
simply too far from the light source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they think they are not getting
enough light, if they're not reaching
[SPEAKER_00]: their daily light integral, they will
begin to flower simply because they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: getting enough light energy and they think
that the end of the world, the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: season is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another reason that these plants may
begin to flower on you is because they may
[SPEAKER_00]: be root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: What size pot are they in?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long have they been in that pot?
[SPEAKER_00]: If those roots are trying to grow and they
don't have anywhere to go, they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: bound up, they're all twisted around in
that pot, that plant is going to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got nothing left to do but flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only got a few weeks left in this pot
before it's going to be terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants may be stuck wearing shoes
that are way too small and they may be
[SPEAKER_00]: angry about it and they just want bigger
shoes and until you give them bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: shoes, they're going to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if one day when you were like
seven or eight years old, I put some shoes
[SPEAKER_00]: on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I laced them up real nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, those are your shoes,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you got to live your whole life in
those shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that you're a grown ass adult,
those little kid shoes are going to be so
[SPEAKER_00]: super tight and so uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant has lived its entire life in
that container and it may be root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be really uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its toes are cramped.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has no choice but to flower now just
because that's its final survival
[SPEAKER_00]: instinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, this is what I know how to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was my entire goal in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: A cannabis plant's main goal is to
reproduce and make more seed for the next
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's its main goal and it does that by
going into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The male plants get taller than the other
plants so they can drop their pollen down
[SPEAKER_00]: on the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: The females get white and bushy so they
can make a lot of bud sites, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can receive a lot of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can drop seeds for the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: A cannabis plant's main goal is to receive
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cannot do that until it goes into
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you stress it, you piss it off,
it goes, this is what I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to flower because I need to get
out of this situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way I can do that is to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they'll cut me down and smoke me or I
get to make seeds for the next generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are also some nutrients and
things you could spray or feed to your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants which may trigger them to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about some products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that Advanced Nutrients used to
sell a bud igniter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you accidentally fed that to your veg
plants, they would be in flower next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't do anything about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You fed them bud igniter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're switching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get ready, go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are products that if you
accidentally feed, those will possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially make your plants flip too
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants are stressed, if they're
not getting fed enough, if they're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: fed too much, if there are more than one
or two stressors on a plant, it can make
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant pre-flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think your plant is probably root
bound or you possibly don't have enough
[SPEAKER_00]: light or the worst case scenario is you
ended up with some accidental auto flower
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Brendan, I hope I answered your
question sufficiently.
