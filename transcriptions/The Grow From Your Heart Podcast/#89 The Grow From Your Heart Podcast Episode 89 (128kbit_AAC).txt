[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 89 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to the Mystic Roots Band for
[SPEAKER_00]: letting me use their music on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to Kat Koot and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, you guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everybody's having a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm coming to you on a scorching hot
Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is stupid hot today, but we're going to
deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to drink a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to water up the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to talk a little bit
about some heat issues that some friends
[SPEAKER_00]: of mine have been having in their gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk about ways to cure a little
bit of heat problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've got some ranting to do,
but before we get that far, this podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: is brought to you by my friends at Hygro
Indoor Growing Supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies has two
locations to serve Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visit the Denver store at 6271 Beach
Street or check out the Pueblo location on
[SPEAKER_00]: 618 East 4th Street in beautiful Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out Hygro for competitive pricing
and a great selection of indoor grow
[SPEAKER_00]: supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, when you're checking out at
Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure you let them know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You listen to the Grow From Your Heart
podcast and they will give you commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: pricing on your entire purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll pay what I pay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll put some money back in your pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, we all know that money is
expensive these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're going to get on with the
show here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to let you guys know that I'm
recording with a new device today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using the new Zoom H6 Handy Recorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the Zoom H6 so that I'll be able to
take this podcast on the road a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a much smaller unit than what I've
been using.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing will fit in my back pocket and
I can carry it around and I can do shows
[SPEAKER_00]: from events such as the Secret Cup,
the Cannabis Cup, or wherever we may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys look forward to episodes with
special guests coming up because now I can
[SPEAKER_00]: take the show to them instead of trying to
get people to come to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in kind of a shitty part of
Colorado where nobody wants to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to get like Damsel and Hunt
and people like that to come here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I go to them, they're happy to be
on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been a few bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the Zoom H6.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will take this show on the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm going to ask you to do me a
favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since you're listening to the show,
let me know what you think of the sound
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know if this quality is acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know if I've changed anything that
you've noticed because if this isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: acceptable, I'll go back to using the main
studio setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to pull this out,
give it a try, see what it was like before
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to take it on the road and record
with other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, big shout out to the Zoom H6.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you think of it,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so let's get into the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you that I saw some ducting issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a consultation for a friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even charge him for it the other
day, but he's been saying, dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: my room is getting way too hot this
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good start of a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I walked in there and the first thing I
see is messy-ass ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dude's got a decent grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got enough air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: His plants look good, but his ducting was
a complete mess, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen a lot of messy ducting
lately on my visits and consultations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing I want to tell you is keep in
mind that every single twist and bend in
[SPEAKER_00]: your ducting reduces your airflow and adds
to the workload of your blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever kind of inline fan you're using,
every bend puts more strain and more
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure on that inline fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it slows down the amount of air you're
moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ideally, ducting would be in a straight
line with zero curves or bends or twists
[SPEAKER_00]: or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know that's not rational because,
of course, we're growing in houses and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to move the air around in not
a straight line sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But try to get it as straight as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll save you a lot of money on heating
costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll save you money because you don't
have to run the blower as hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll save you money because you're more
efficiently cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So straighten out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I just noticed something.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you put the cell phone too close to
the H6, you get a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: interference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry about that, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you didn't hear that too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm reading notes off of my cell phone
here, which is why I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, try to keep your ducting in a
straight line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great way to save some money on
cooling, you guys, would be to run your
[SPEAKER_00]: lights at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kilowatts from the electric company are
actually cheaper at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're not running your electricity
at peak hours, it'll save you a few bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would recommend, if you can do
it, and this will only work for some
[SPEAKER_00]: people on your lifestyle, your schedule,
if you can have your plants come on,
[SPEAKER_00]: right around here it gets dark about nine
o'clock, eight or nine o'clock-ish right
[SPEAKER_00]: now, it would be ideal to have your lights
come on at 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way it's cool outside, the sun has
gone down, the lights kick on,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that way you're not fighting the sun
all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not adding sun and grow lights to
that grow room to try to cool down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So turn on your lights at night if you
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so you guys, straighten out
your ducting, run your light cycle at
[SPEAKER_00]: night, and you'll save a few bucks on
cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna cost, getting your plants too
hot is gonna cause them to become fluffy,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's gonna decrease your harvest
weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you've got electricity bills to
cover, every gram counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you gotta do your best to pull every
gram you can out of the room, since you've
[SPEAKER_00]: gotta pay for every kilowatt that you've
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So figure out how to get the ducting
straight, start running your lights at
[SPEAKER_00]: night, and that will help you out quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else you guys could keep in mind
during these hot summer months is
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the temperatures rise, the humidity
outside is rising also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be aware of how humid your rooms are.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first year that I have
personally needed to go buy a dehumidifier
[SPEAKER_00]: for my main flowering room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fans and air conditioning are not enough
sometimes, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to remove the stagnant humid air
from your rooms and replace it with fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2-rich air for your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, make sure you're pulling that
air out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That hot air needs to be sucked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, one more thing I can think of
to help you keep your rooms cool is to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to the filters in your air
conditioners, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those filters are designed to last for a
year without being replaced, but keep in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind, you guys are running them in a grow
room where there may be a lot of extra
[SPEAKER_00]: dirt, a lot of humidity, and there's a lot
of extra work on that unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't expect that unit to be
competing with four or five or six,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you got, that many thousand watt
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't expect that thing to come on
when you buy it and never shut off,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a lot of us do with an air
conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got an air conditioner that
has filters, replace those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they get clogged up, the air doesn't
flow through, you don't get as much
[SPEAKER_00]: cooling, you're wasting electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That electricity is not turning into a
gram of weed, so you're flushing money
[SPEAKER_00]: down the toilet, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your air conditioner may require a little
extra maintenance since we're working it
[SPEAKER_00]: so hard, you guys, and also keep in mind
where you're putting your air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may suck up a little bit more dirt and
shit like that, just depending on where
[SPEAKER_00]: you have put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so that was a good little rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we're talking about replacing things
and things that you need to upgrade in
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow room, I figured I'd make a
little kind of a checklist of things that
[SPEAKER_00]: would be a good idea to replace and check
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that you guys need to replace is
your bulbs in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The HID bulbs don't last forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using good bulbs, you can switch
those out about once every six months,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if you've got the budget, you can toss
them every two crops, which would be about
[SPEAKER_00]: every four months.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's only if you're using them only as a
flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're buying those cheap PlantMax
bulbs, you guys, or whatever generic brand
[SPEAKER_00]: you're buying at your grow shop,
I would recommend replacing those every
[SPEAKER_00]: single flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those aren't high quality bulbs and they
burn out a little bit quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, if you're using those cheap
bulbs, guys, what I would recommend is
hardwood bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest the room, empty the room,
clean it out, and replace those bulbs
[SPEAKER_00]: before you put new plants in there again.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using good bulbs, you can go
probably two cycles, maybe three.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely wouldn't go past four
flowering cycles with the same bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would replace that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bulb will stop putting out as much
light, but it will still be sucking up as
[SPEAKER_00]: much electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will still be making as much heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you're not turning those kilowatts
into grams of weed, which is your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to pay for electricity that
is just causing heat, which is making your
[SPEAKER_00]: air conditioner run stronger, which is
pulling more electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the cycle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so don't forget that your bulbs
in your veg area are just as important as
[SPEAKER_00]: in your flowering room, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to swap those bulbs out
occasionally also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like those new 315 bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll reason those at the shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to put out quite a bit of light
and they're affordable, so if you guys can
[SPEAKER_00]: afford the 315s, I would definitely
recommend those.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go with your metal halide
bulbs, I would recommend those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, every two months, every four
months, every six months at the very
[SPEAKER_00]: longest, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't run longer than six months on
the same bulb, no matter what you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got those T5 bulbs, you're going
to need to replace those quite frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things just crap out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've noticed about the T5s,
if you buy a fixture with eight T5s in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: just pretty much plan on replacing all
eight T5 bulbs all at the same time,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're all just going to start
shitting out.
[SPEAKER_00]: When one goes out, just go by the whole
set.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about replacing your bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what about the ballasts?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using modern digital ballasts,
they'll last a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them come with a nice warranty,
so you didn't hear this from me,
[SPEAKER_00]: but anything that comes with a warranty
that will be replaced because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: warranty, I make sure to break that thing
about a month or two before the warranty
[SPEAKER_00]: is up, sometimes a few months before the
warranty is up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just break it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just fucking break it, and then go get
another one on the warranty, because these
[SPEAKER_00]: companies are charging you enough for shit
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should last a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Break it and go get a new one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to refurbish the one that
you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to resell it as a
refurbished unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make plenty of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just break the fucking thing right before
the warranty is up, and get yourself a new
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using those old magnetic
ballasts, those things will go forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't see any drop in light power from
a ballast from what I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll just die one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't even warn you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When your ballast warranty is about to be
up, go get another one, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that should be enough ranting
for now about fixing your rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I should remind you of that I
have mentioned in a previous episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: since we're talking about replacing
things, calibrate your pH meters,
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your TDS pins, your pH pins, whatever else
you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your EC meter, if you're in England or
Britain, you guys calibrate those things
[SPEAKER_00]: quite frequently, because when that messes
up, you don't even notice, and you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: in there trying to adjust pH, and you're
doing it wrong, and you don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you're going to start causing problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I've been going for
just over 10 minutes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a quick dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do a dab on the air together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was recently gifted some blueberry
headband shatter from the spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually the shatterers from our boys
at Turpex.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it at the spot out in Pueblo West.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a quick drink of this
bubbly carbonated beverage I got here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we're going to put together a
dab, and we're going to take a dab
[SPEAKER_00]: together, so here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I needed a carbonated drink
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was much deserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get a dab together real
quick, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to something called the
Perfect Jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was gifted a jar called the Perfect Jar
by my buddy Hunt of the Grimy Gatsby,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they might be right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be the Perfect Jar,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what kind of plastic
this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real sturdy plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a nice screw on lid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's airtight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nicely ... It's got dividers inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm able to carry my herb in one
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a dabber in one container,
and then four or five different kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: shatter in the other little containers
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice container, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you kicking that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we are going to dab the ... What
did I call it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's blueberry headband from our friends
at Turpex, and I'm putting a dab of it on
[SPEAKER_00]: the dabber right now as we speak,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are dabbing out of the Eric Ross 4.0
custom prototype that's autographed by
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric Ross on the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got his little signature etched in
the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: To that, it's got the highly educated
D-Nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to highly educated and Task
Rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: That D-Nail attachment is attached to what
is called the G-Nail coil by our friends
[SPEAKER_00]: at Emotec.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Giddyup and Emotec.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm burping from that drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the dab together, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blueberry headband shatter from Turpex,
available at this spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time you hear this, they'll have a
totally different brand of shatter in or a
[SPEAKER_00]: totally different flavor, but let's review
this anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: No choke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me back up a step here.
[SPEAKER_00]: By looking at it, it's nice and glossy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a nice shine to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice and clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a nice clear amber-yellow color,
so it looks great.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the inhale, well, let me talk about the
smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just smells like hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's smell it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put it up to the nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shatter mostly smells the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that shattery, almost a honey,
kind of a sweet smell to it, but anyway,
[SPEAKER_00]: it looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells good.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I taste it, on the inhale,
I definitely tasted the blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the exhale, it had a hint of cushy,
chem-y type of stuff, an earthy flavor on
[SPEAKER_00]: the out, so the N is blueberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a hint of blueberry on the tongue
still, but you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: The feeling is straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like I just put a headband on my
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like I just slowed down,
to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like I just slowed down a whole
bunch, so let's get back into doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I certainly approve of the blueberry
headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes like blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how I was fucked from it,
to tell you the truth, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse the cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now that I'm high as shit,
I want to answer some questions that
[SPEAKER_00]: people have sent to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: These questions have come from Periscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've come from Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten them in emails, and I have
gotten them on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you're not checking it out on
Periscope, every occasionally,
[SPEAKER_00]: I jump onto Periscope, and I take a couple
of dabs, and I rant, and I hang out with
[SPEAKER_00]: my friends, and I talk about a few things
that are on my mind, and then I just sign
[SPEAKER_00]: out and say goodbye, and I usually delete
the videos pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever check out the Periscope app,
make sure you follow me, and you can check
[SPEAKER_00]: out some of the videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the future, I'll do a full podcast on
Periscope, and you'll be able to jump in
[SPEAKER_00]: and ask me questions, and I'll be able to
answer them live for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only problem with that right now is
you guys, I'm taking over as the lead
[SPEAKER_00]: grower at the spot dispensary,
and there's been a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some days, we work until noon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other days, we work until six.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, scheduling things is a little
bit of a pain in the ass, but I promise
[SPEAKER_00]: you I'm going to do this Periscope
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just promised you, so that means I've
got to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never promised you something and not
done it on this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so let me get to the point
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Questions and answers with Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our first question is about a product
called OGT.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite a while ago, I mentioned that I use
a product called OGT, Veganic Secret
[SPEAKER_00]: Sauce, is what I think it's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody asked me to talk a little bit
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that product a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any other product with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used all of what I have, and I kind
of haven't been using it since I ran out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I replaced it with something else,
but what it is is an organic tea that is
[SPEAKER_00]: able to be mixed almost instantly and then
fed to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of teas that we're using need to be
mixed up, and they need to brew for 24 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff, you can pour the powder into
some water, give it a nice stir,
[SPEAKER_00]: and feed it directly to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I did notice that it
promoted ridiculously healthy roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: My roots were growing quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: My roots were growing out of the holes in
the bottoms of my pots, the drainage
[SPEAKER_00]: holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: My roots were coming out of there looking
for somewhere else to go hide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a friend who breaks down the soil
from my harvested plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets paid to help me out a little bit,
and when Mike was breaking down those root
[SPEAKER_00]: balls, he asked me, dude, what have you
been doing differently lately because
[SPEAKER_00]: these things are amazing?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that I will attribute to the
secret sauce, the OGT.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was doing a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really great for the early life
cycle of the plants and for veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I went into flower, here's something
that I didn't realize was happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed there was something weird,
and somebody else pointed it out to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was in flower and I was feeding
OGT, I would feed it every other week.
[SPEAKER_00]: On those weeks, I would notice that my
plants would progress more into what looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like a nutrient deficiency on some
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had strains that I was feeding it just
like I have before, and it looked like it
[SPEAKER_00]: was becoming nitrogen deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant couldn't keep up with itself,
and it was just burning out really early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned that to our friend Sean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned that the only thing I was
using differently was the OGT.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sean said that the rock phosphates that
they are using to produce the OGT speed up
[SPEAKER_00]: the nutritive cycle of your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to use this stuff,
I would only use it during the veg cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: and use it very sparingly during the
flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when I used the recommended
dosage, it sped my plants up almost too
[SPEAKER_00]: much, and they weren't burned,
but they were growing so quickly and using
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients so quickly that they were eating
all of their food for the week within the
[SPEAKER_00]: first couple of the days and then starving
themselves is what it looked like was
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my little rant on OGT.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good product, but if you're going
to use it, be prepared, and you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have to adjust your feeding,
and you're going to have to pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're doing that every time you
put a new product into your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, all right, so our next question,
I want to move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did I put it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next question comes from Periscope,
and somebody asked me, and this is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to take me a little bit to describe here,
but somebody said, what is solventless?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I was talking about solventless on
Periscope, and they did not have it in
[SPEAKER_00]: context, so let me try to describe to you
what solventless is.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, let me say that solventless is
a marketing tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's owned by him,
but it is the marketing term that he has
[SPEAKER_00]: put on what he calls solventless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that being said, not all solventless
hash has to come from nicotine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any hash that is made without a solvent
will be considered solventless.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most cases, and 99% of the cases in the
cannabis industry, I've never seen
[SPEAKER_00]: anything else called a non-solvent,
maybe Dry Sift, but that's totally
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water hash or bubble hash is solventless.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made with ice and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The solvents that we are using is BHO,
PHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple other gases that people
are using to extract hash with lately,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the propane and the butane are the
solvents, and I know a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to say, but water is a solvent as
well, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, and I'm going to paraphrase
what Nickatee says all of the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: a big shout out to DJ Nickatee.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're talking about solventless hash,
water is not being used as a solvent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being used as a mechanical separator.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not trying to dissolve the
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not trying to dissolve the plant
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just simply using it as a way to
wash the trichomes off of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, solventless hash is basically hash
made by using ice or water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solventless made by DJ Nickatee is kept at
a certain temperature at all times,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it never gets warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It never gets dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It never hardens up, and it's always got a
nice greasy texture to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always real tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's solventless.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so since we're talking about
solventless, let me describe a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: other types of hash just to kind of put
that in perspective a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other types of hash that are super popular
right now that everybody talks about are
[SPEAKER_00]: BHO, which is butane honey oil,
or butane hash, or dabs, or shatter,
[SPEAKER_00]: or wax.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much the most popular right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, there is live resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Live resin is basically, it is BHO that is
made from fresh frozen plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it is blasted through an obi dose
machine by Emotec.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way that you can make live resin
is through an Emotec machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that sounds crazy, but like I
said earlier, Nickatee has made the
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing term solventless.
[SPEAKER_00]: The boys at Emotec have come up with the
term live resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, unless you're running it Emotec style
in an Emotec machine, you're not making
[SPEAKER_00]: live resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are gonna hate on me for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is my theory, and I'm sticking to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I've got time for one
more question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question comes from Facebook,
and it's from our friend Bobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobby is starting his first grow,
and he's asking if it is okay to use
[SPEAKER_00]: Miracle Grow plant food or Miracle Grow
soil for his cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys, I definitely have to say I
strongly recommend not using any Miracle
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow products in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Miracle Grow soil has time-released
fertilizers in it, which will last for up
[SPEAKER_00]: to six months, and you don't want nitrogen
being released into your plants for six
[SPEAKER_00]: months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would recommend not using that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use something like a Fox Farms product or
a Roots Organics product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use something like that if you're a new
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you a solid start.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not nutrients in it that are gonna
screw you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll have things in it that will help you
out from the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: As for the nutrients, if you are trying to
use Miracle Grow nutrients, I would throw
[SPEAKER_00]: those away right away, get rid of the
plant food, head to your Hydro Shop,
[SPEAKER_00]: head to Hydro Indoor Growing Supplies,
and get yourself a basic two- or
[SPEAKER_00]: three-part nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be a bottle A, a bottle B of a
brand that sounds good to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys at the Hydro Shop can definitely
talk you through what you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll help you pick a brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're mainly, if you're just starting
out, they're mainly the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say go with something like
Botanicare, BioBiz, something simple,
[SPEAKER_00]: just something with an A and a B.
[SPEAKER_00]: The General Organics or General
Hydroponics, Flora Nova stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's all fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any of that stuff you wanna go for,
it's pretty much all the same thing if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're starting out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get yourself an A and a B, maybe a Bloom
Booster, and then maybe some Sugary or
[SPEAKER_00]: something to sweeten it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But definitely get away from that Miracle
Grow stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the Hydro Shop, get something
designed more toward cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: something that you can control for each
cycle of your plants, because you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna want the same nutrients from
beginning to end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a little bit of grow in the
beginning, and you're gonna taper the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: off as you get into flower, and you'll
start using the Bloom Solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go get something that's more designed
for the plants that you are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobby, I hope that helps you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys that are thinking about Miracle
Grow soil, I hope I got you away from
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, here's something to think about,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miracle Grow products are all from Scotts,
and Scotts is a Monsanto brand,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we do not want to support Monsanto,
because Monsanto does not support the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about where the products you're
buying are made, and who they affect,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the impact that you will have on the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I think that was
enough questions for one episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to thank everybody who sent
me questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to send questions to me via
email, if you want to hit me up on
[SPEAKER_00]: Twitter, if you want to Facebook me,
however you want to get a question to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're one of my friends, if you're one
of the homies, feel free to send it to me
[SPEAKER_00]: via text message.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can message me directly on Instagram,
on the iReadGenetics Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I love the questions,
I love the interaction, I love helping you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I got the show going for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really appreciate it, big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate all of those questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I'll be back next
week for another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a question from a listener asking,
what are the difference, or what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between THC and CBD?
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be one before that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be a lot of putting
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of work going into that
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if it'll be ready by the next
one, but I will definitely have it ready
[SPEAKER_00]: by number 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, I'm going to wrap up the
show.
