last week Thank you for checking on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize for not putting out a show
I try to post an episode Once a week,
[SPEAKER_00]: but sometimes the summer happens and I am
going to skip a couple of shows and enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: myself I am safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is iry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was visiting a couple of friends I spent
a lot more time there than I had
[SPEAKER_00]: anticipated but sometimes friends and
family are going to take precedent over a
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast This was one of those times I
thought I would catch up later in the week
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did not because I got the honor and
privilege to go see miss Natalie rise do
[SPEAKER_00]: three shows in Colorado I got to see the
show in Denver Just a short drive up the
[SPEAKER_00]: highway and an excellent amazing show lots
of good friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my buddy reggae in my head I
got to see him there and hang out saw lots
[SPEAKER_00]: of other friends But reggae deserves a big
shout out and then the next day miss
[SPEAKER_00]: Natalie rise played here in my town,
which is Pueblo, Colorado That was just a
[SPEAKER_00]: short drive up the road So that was great
to see Natalie in my town And then I was
[SPEAKER_00]: honored and privileged enough to be
invited to a private a barbecue with
[SPEAKER_00]: Natalie rise and some of the very close
rise nation crew That was a great weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to miss Natalie rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to everybody from Rise nation I
cannot list everybody but you guys and
[SPEAKER_00]: gals all know who you are Extra big shout
out to the quarantine a backyard concert
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_00]: You folks are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, big shout out to the crew I had a
great time seeing Natalie rise,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this all started by saying thank you

[SPEAKER_00]: really good to have loyal Followers
supporters listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are my friends is what I want to
call you It's great to have people that
[SPEAKER_00]: say hey, dude, your podcast didn't come

[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to check on that second of
all if it wasn't a tech issue Are you
[SPEAKER_00]: okay?

time to segue into some emails I do have a
[SPEAKER_00]: website that website is I read genetics
comm let me clarify something I have two
[SPEAKER_00]: websites One of them is I read genetics
comm that website will also Lead you to I
[SPEAKER_00]: read direct comm I've got two websites for
logistics purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes sense if you understand the
background reasons We're not gonna talk
[SPEAKER_00]: too much about that But the seeds I
advertise are at I read direct comm the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of the things are at I read genetics
comm that's where you can find a link to
[SPEAKER_00]: patreon a link to my discord server a link
to get merchandise where we sell grinders
[SPEAKER_00]: t-shirts rolling trays things of that
nature Anyhow on that website I read
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics comm there is a tab that says
grow help Or grow questions if you click
[SPEAKER_00]: on that tab and send me a grow question I
may read that question here on the show if
[SPEAKER_00]: I read that question here on the show
Guess what you win a coupon code for a
[SPEAKER_00]: free pack of seeds at I read direct comm
The first email from that grow help tab
[SPEAKER_00]: today came from our friend We're just
gonna call them Matthew big shout out to

[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm never gonna do I'm not that way
anyway But I'd keep the bad attitude the
[SPEAKER_00]: negative stuff off of camera.

best way You could do it right be grateful
[SPEAKER_00]: and not be yeah, the other way would suck
anyhow spreading love That's just what I

the excellent concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna keep going though This message
says I've been looking for the lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeffrey for quite some time now As I tried
a local strain called lemon drop a while
[SPEAKER_00]: back and it had the best lemon flavor and
effect on my mind that I've ever had Okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that you're after the lemon Jeffrey
because the lemon drop made you happy I do
[SPEAKER_00]: agree that you may find something with
those lemon turps that makes you happy
[SPEAKER_00]: makes you smiley That's why I like the
lemon Jeffrey It fixes my my weird
[SPEAKER_00]: glitches and it makes me feel like a
normal person and it makes me Happy and
[SPEAKER_00]: smiley and chatty and rambly which is a
good spot for a podcaster to be anyhow it
[SPEAKER_00]: says I would like to ask if there is a way
I can be added to a list for when these
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds Restock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you in advance from your friend
Matthew Yes, the elusive lemon Jeffrey
[SPEAKER_00]: packs every time I put more lemon Jeffrey
on I redirect it sells out quite quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how many I put on there People
just buy them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you guys are waiting in
line for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if something Happened
somewhere where it's super popular,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I cannot keep them in stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot make them quickly enough
Unfortunately, I only have a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: packs left in my own private reserve right
now that I will not let go of those are
[SPEAKER_00]: for me in case something were to go wrong,
but Have no fear because I will make more
[SPEAKER_00]: lemon Jeffrey seeds in the very near
future Not right now not this run But in
[SPEAKER_00]: the next couple of runs there will be more
lemon Jeffrey seeds created now this
[SPEAKER_00]: person asked Matthew asked is there a way
they can be added to a list for when these
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds Drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there absolutely is an amazing way to
be added to a list on the website Where
[SPEAKER_00]: you sent this message at I read genetics
comm toward the bottom of that page
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a spot that says stay up to date
and there's a picture of like a it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: a letter like an envelope You can type in
your email address in there and if you
[SPEAKER_00]: type in your email address and hit send
that will add you to The newsletter that I
[SPEAKER_00]: use to send out to let everybody know
about restocks fresh drops brand new stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: merchandise sales Events that are coming
up places.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may be I've been trying not to spam you
guys too much because I was hitting you
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty hard there for a few minutes with
emails But if you join that newsletter
[SPEAKER_00]: that is where you will get all of those
updates and I try to send Maybe one every
[SPEAKER_00]: other week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try for one a month But sometimes during
holidays you may get bombarded if I hit
[SPEAKER_00]: you with the 420 sale I'll give you a hey
There's a sale coming and then hey the
[SPEAKER_00]: sale started and then a hey, don't forget
about the sale I may sandwich three emails
[SPEAKER_00]: in a row there, but I try not to overload
You unless it's really worth your time to
[SPEAKER_00]: go take a look So the place to go get
added to that list is on my newsletter and
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics comm scroll halfway down
You'll see the spot where it says stay up
[SPEAKER_00]: to date.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you stay up to date my friend
also Patreon gets the heads up first I
[SPEAKER_00]: promise all patreon members that they get
the first heads up of all the newsletters

copy it and I paste it to patreon and
[SPEAKER_00]: patreon gets it first the newsletter will
go out sometime in the morning or Early
[SPEAKER_00]: afternoon patreon will get it at like 3 5
o'clock in the morning as I'm composing it

[SPEAKER_00]: All right podcast world Let's keep this
good energy going and work our way into
[SPEAKER_00]: the next segment of today's podcast If
you've been watching for a while,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know I like to do a grow room pet
peeve section Of the show most of you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what a pet peeve is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something that just drives you
crazy Sometimes I'll be in a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: grow sometimes I'll be in a friends grow
sometimes I'll see something online that
[SPEAKER_00]: just drives me crazy and a grow that is a
pet peeve I encourage you as listeners to
[SPEAKER_00]: send me your grow room pet peeve You can
send me those grow room pet peeves on that
[SPEAKER_00]: grow help tab at I read genetics.com
Today's pet peeve came from our friend who
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to be called Brody G Big shout
out to my new friend Brody.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message goes a little Bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says hey Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you had a good fourth of July
holiday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was excellent It was a great holiday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me jump to the question part It says
my biggest pet peeve was after all these
[SPEAKER_00]: years of growing When somebody sells me a
cut claiming it is something popular and
[SPEAKER_00]: it turns out not to be the real thing That
is very frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is it's almost offensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen that break up friendships.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been sold Somebody claimed they
sold me something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not what they sold Me they took a
lot of money from me and now they act like
[SPEAKER_00]: I did something wrong because I want some
sort of Acknowledgement at fucking least
[SPEAKER_00]: that this guy gave me the wrong clones,
but he doesn't care anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the asshole for pointing it out I
understand how that goes I kind of lost a
[SPEAKER_00]: friend possibly a business partner because
he sold me cuts and he's like I got extras
[SPEAKER_00]: if you want him and he knew that it wasn't
what he was giving me he knew that but
[SPEAKER_00]: anyhow it goes on it says It's not only a
waste of money time and grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a massive disappointment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I agree with that Not only a
disappointment it can kind of piss you off
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit because you've been hyping it
up You told all your friends like bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this new cut I got this new fucking
space monkey balls and you're fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: excited about it And you're telling all
your homies and you're sending pictures
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you smoke it You're like this is
fucking blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've been there before bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like yeah, I've been there not just
massive disappointment Sometimes you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit flat-out pissed off It depends
on how much you paid for that cut and how
[SPEAKER_00]: many of them you bought who you got it
from If it's just some random dude on
[SPEAKER_00]: Craigslist that I met met in a parking lot
And gave him 25 bucks for a clone that's
[SPEAKER_00]: on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my dumbass fault for trusting that
guy But if it's one of the guys in the
[SPEAKER_00]: circle that I know that like actually,
I know he has this cut He's got the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking monkey space balls, whatever I
called it I'm like selling me a cut of
[SPEAKER_00]: that and he's like sure bro, and he sells
it to me And I know he gave me fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: blue dream and I grow it and I can tell
right away That is that's fucking wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that definitely will cause a rift
in the force.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me keep reading There's more to this
it says I appreciate the fact that you
[SPEAKER_00]: give back to the community and so many
Different ways peace love and big dabs
[SPEAKER_00]: from Brody G bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the acknowledgement that I'm
giving back to the community I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: we've cultivated a great community with
the iry army with the GF YH podcast crew
[SPEAKER_00]: with the iry genetics team Which is
growers in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a really good community
happening right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all in a good spot The discord is
poppin all of the comment sections have
[SPEAKER_00]: been real positive So thank you for
noticing that I'm trying to to give back
[SPEAKER_00]: to the community The community has been
really important to me lately that word
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole word community the idea of
community is becoming more important to
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you I appreciate that and my dude
Brody G once again check your email check
[SPEAKER_00]: your inbox check your spam Because you my
dude have a coupon code for a free pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds at iry direct dot com Alright
podcast world now is the part of the show
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have all been waiting for I'm
sure you saw in the title that we are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to talk about fist bump and redline
So let's get down to business shall we
[SPEAKER_00]: this portion of the podcast was inspired
by a Question that came from that grow
[SPEAKER_00]: help tab on iry genetics comm this
question came from my new friend Richard
[SPEAKER_00]: Richard Make sure you check your inbox and
check your spam because you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: coupon code for a free pack of seeds from
iry direct comm Richards question goes a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says hey Rasta Jeff My spirit tells me
that your genetics are legit and I will be
[SPEAKER_00]: purchasing exclusively from you That is a
great statement and a great way to start
[SPEAKER_00]: an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely appreciate that it feels good
to know That your spirit thinks that my
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics are legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of a lot of that's a huge
compliment There is what I'm trying to say
[SPEAKER_00]: and the idea of purchasing exclusively
from me is great I do not expect any
[SPEAKER_00]: loyalty, but I definitely do appreciate
that loyalty now Let me keep going because
[SPEAKER_00]: it does say recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got fist bump and redline seeds I am now
62 years old and I have a green thumb Can
[SPEAKER_00]: you please describe the flavor profile of
these great cultivars?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the iry vibes Richard yes,
I would be happy to describe the Flavors
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll actually give you a couple more
details on these strains while we are here
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start with fist bump fist
bump is one of my favorite strains one of
[SPEAKER_00]: my best-selling strains one of my most
popular strains right now Fist bump is
[SPEAKER_00]: only available in regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean you will get male and female seeds
out of the pack I did not and I probably
[SPEAKER_00]: will not make fist bump in a feminized
form I've just got a lot of other things
[SPEAKER_00]: in mind, but I just want to start by
saying Fist bump is available in regular
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds only so there will be males and
females in this package And I do have a
[SPEAKER_00]: few notes that I'm going to try to use to
try and keep myself on track But we all
[SPEAKER_00]: know how that goes if you've been here
before now, let's start with the name fist
[SPEAKER_00]: bump Why did I call the strain fist bump?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did that come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know I'm a reggae fan I like to
go to a lot of reggae shows Anytime you're
[SPEAKER_00]: at a reggae show and you see a friend or
if you meet a reggae artist We don't shake
[SPEAKER_00]: hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: We give a fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a sign of respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like what's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I respect you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is our version of a fist bump I'm
sure a lot of different cultures out there
[SPEAKER_00]: do a fist bump anybody from rasta culture
to Skateboarders to bar bros to biker
[SPEAKER_00]: dudes to sports guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all give a fist bump fist bump just
says what's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're connecting what better way to name a
strain than fist bump show we are
[SPEAKER_00]: connecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some love for you We're on the same
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're on the same team.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fist bump just a fist bump for all the
ganja growers out there So that's where
[SPEAKER_00]: fist bump came from now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk more about the plants
themselves Fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the cross of fist bump?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a cross of sour diesel and a rise
what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really fast growing tall branchy
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes plants that grow really tall
really quickly be ready for tall plants I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to I want to say that a couple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna get tall They're also gonna
get branchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those branches are also going to get
very tall If you do not top the fist bump,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will get a very big fat dominant Top
cola if you grow a really big fat top
[SPEAKER_00]: cola, make sure you keep your VPD in line
If you've got a room that is known to get
[SPEAKER_00]: too humid or have VPD issues I recommend
topping fist bump and growing a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: they won't be tiny But you won't get this
big donkey dick style bud that you
[SPEAKER_00]: normally would you won't get that big
baseball bat You'll get a bunch of smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: baseball bats Which then will prevent that
powdery mildew or that bud rot issue from
[SPEAKER_00]: happening that I said prevent it will help
stop that You do have to correct the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do have an over humid room I
recommend topping to prevent that giant
[SPEAKER_00]: Cola set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where else should we go from here?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow very quickly that 21 day stretch
These plants are going to take off on you
[SPEAKER_00]: be prepared for that These plants will
double if not more in size by the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: flower So however tall if it's a foot tall
when you put it into flower It will be two
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe two and a half feet tall by the time
it is done be prepared for that They are
[SPEAKER_00]: stretchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also heavy feeders in veg They
like a lot of nitrogen when you put them
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower Don't cut that nitrogen off
immediately all of my arise crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that came from King Solomon my
arise mail is Basically a pretty heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: feeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna want to give it a lot of
nitrogen when you flip the flower I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend cutting off that nitrogen like a
lot of growers do I recommend tapering it
[SPEAKER_00]: off slowly so slowly taper off that
nitrogen so they don't fade out too
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly along You if you see yellowing
early with fist bump or most of my stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that is bred with King Solomon I encourage
a foliar feed with some nitrogen to help
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant along Nitrogen is a mobile
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll move itself where it needs to be
That's the short version of what happens,
[SPEAKER_00]: but don't let that nitrogen get away from
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's stay focused taper off the nitrogen
slowly then Let these plants finish these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are going to take about 10 weeks if
not A little bit more sometimes 72 77 days
[SPEAKER_00]: is appropriate Don't be afraid to let them
go because they will bulk up at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: and get super Fat on you that extra time
will pay off you will get extra weight in
[SPEAKER_00]: the long run I wrote down 10 plus weeks as
my note here These plants they do take
[SPEAKER_00]: well to trellising topping popping
scrogging.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can abuse these plants They will take
it the only challenging part about the
[SPEAKER_00]: fist bump plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well two challenging parts They're going
to get big more quickly than you're
[SPEAKER_00]: anticipating these plants will get away
from you They'll grow very quickly if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not paying attention You'll think
I've got time to put some stakes in there
[SPEAKER_00]: or time to trellis that you don't do it
now They're going to get away from me The
[SPEAKER_00]: other struggle you may face is feeding if
you don't feed them properly early on
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll never catch up You'll be chasing
the feeding forever with these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, they're fairly easy to grow I
know that sounds intimidating saying they
[SPEAKER_00]: get tall and hungry, but most growers can
handle that most of you Overfeed your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants anyway, so I think you're gonna be
okay Now the main question here was can we
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about the aromas and flavors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, this is where it gets exciting Fist
bump since it's got that sour diesel in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes out gassy and fuely it's like a
little it's got the gassy top to it where
[SPEAKER_00]: gas like gasoline has a Certain an alcohol
smell to it, but it's also got diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: which is nasty So it comes out with both
of those turps then also From the golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some citrus and some like
tropical sweetness So it's like a it's
[SPEAKER_00]: almost like a tropical smoothie almost not
an orange Julius But a tropical Julius if
[SPEAKER_00]: that makes any sense to your turp flavor
mind It's like if you ate a tropical
[SPEAKER_00]: Julius if you had a one of those those
Mexican ice cream fruit bars From the gas
[SPEAKER_00]: station that are super fucking delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm talking about you
Southern, California people One of those
[SPEAKER_00]: bars a pelletieri bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that how you say it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a great Ringo it's all good next to
the gas pump next to the diesel pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it's like, bro It's like
fruity gasoline at the same time and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really desirable I really love that sort
of buzz that sort of turp now one thing I
[SPEAKER_00]: do notice is that some of the structure
will indicate what the flavors are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be like I've noticed that some of the
phenotypes that display certain visual
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics also do come with certain
scents and aromas the plant with the
[SPEAKER_00]: chunkier big thick top cola that one's
gonna be mostly sour diesel and The one
[SPEAKER_00]: with the finger ear sorta kind of shaped
buds that one is the golden goat There is
[SPEAKER_00]: a phenotype in there that will get really
really tall and kind of skinny It puts off
[SPEAKER_00]: one long tall skinny bud that I believe
comes from the island sweet skunk and
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaiian sativa in the golden goat It's
got a lot of the Hawaiian sativa structure
[SPEAKER_00]: and the island sweet skunk aroma That's
where I really think that one comes from
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can smell it and I can visually
identify those specific phenotypes there
[SPEAKER_00]: are a lot of different phenotypes that
come from the They are not very uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see several different
phenotypes, but you can see the golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat You can see the diesel and then you
can see a couple of the weirdos that pop
[SPEAKER_00]: up as well But I've been talking about
this when it comes to phenotype I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to tell you too much about phenotypes
because I don't want to pick for you I
[SPEAKER_00]: brought you a variety pack of Amazing
flavors and I want you to choose if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want blueberry raspberry strawberry lime
Mandarin guava.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to choose that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to pick that I think you'd be
better at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So choose the phenotype that works best
for you But the flavors and aromas was the
[SPEAKER_00]: main part of the question Gassy diesel
aromas with like a tropical fruit sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: a thing on top of it So it's like you ate
some tropical sorbet or took a bowl of
[SPEAKER_00]: mixed fruit and put that in your mouth But
then you had to sniff gasoline or diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: fuel at the same time That is my feedback
my update my report on fist bump now We're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to work our way into another strain
from here on out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want any confusion I just want it
to be known from here right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are now talking about another strain
We're going to work our way into red line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about red line I think I
started last time with why did I name it
[SPEAKER_00]: red line?
[SPEAKER_00]: Red lines got a couple of different
meanings to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, it's red Lebanese hash plant
So you got the red in there red Lebanese
[SPEAKER_00]: hash plant RL already red line when I saw
the red line I saw RL but red red Lebanese
[SPEAKER_00]: hash plant to the same arise that made the
Fist bump so that's King Solomon to red
[SPEAKER_00]: Lebanese hash plant or red Lebanese hash
plant always list ladies first when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about the cross That's an
important detail red Lebanese hash plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to the arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did I name it red line a couple of
different reasons?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got read in the name already Red line
red line was a bicycle company when it
[SPEAKER_00]: still could be a bicycle company I have
not kept up, but I used to be a bicycle
[SPEAKER_00]: rider.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a BMX enthusiast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved that movie rad I loved Matt
Hoffman.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was into GT bicycles I like freestyle
bikes be BMX biking any way that I could
[SPEAKER_00]: hurt myself on a 20 inch bicycle I was all
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the red line was a popular brand at the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a GT guy I rode Gary Turner bikes,
but red line was super popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people loved it So that played
into my culture my childhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was part of my memories red line
comes from that But also but wait,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's more The first time I smoked red
line my eyes got bloody blind Bloody red
[SPEAKER_00]: they were blood red.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like dangerously red.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like there was blood dripping
down my eyeball It was so red from smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: red line and you guys have watched me take
fat dabs on discord You see me come in
[SPEAKER_00]: here and talk about I just took 72 dabs My
eyes it takes a little bit to get my eyes
[SPEAKER_00]: red They get a little pink sometimes at
the end of the day You can notice I get a
[SPEAKER_00]: little I get the messed up eyes from
smoking too much But not like most people
[SPEAKER_00]: would but the red line my bro Red line had
my eyes bloody dangerous dragon red.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like there was something Wrong
with me and I thought it was an anomaly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've tried again and every time I smoke
red line something about it Just my eyes
[SPEAKER_00]: just get blasted red.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting red thinking about it
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could feel them subconsciously I can
feel myself getting red.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just fucking talking about how much that
makes my eyes red I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what what turp or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoid is in there but something in
that red line just makes my eyes red and
[SPEAKER_00]: it does it to everybody that smokes it At
least everybody I've seen smoke it they
[SPEAKER_00]: all get the super fucking red I so that's
part of why it got called red line because
[SPEAKER_00]: red line bicycles back in the day and then
just because Red line bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your eyes are so red and also a red line
because I got so high bros Like is it the
[SPEAKER_00]: red line there ain't no there's no further
to go That's as high as I'm gonna be after
[SPEAKER_00]: that you ever smoked yourself sober or
just like spent yourself You're like I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: super high and you take another dab and
you're like wait, where'd it go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you just use red line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're you over the max.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta start over now You can start
re-smoking anyway, I am rambly as shit Red
[SPEAKER_00]: line it got called red line because the
red line bicycles you get red-eyed and you
[SPEAKER_00]: are as high as you're gonna Be you're
hitting the red line and it's got red
[SPEAKER_00]: Lebanese hash plant RL is already in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving Red Lebanese hash plant
to arise I'll describe the red Lebanese
[SPEAKER_00]: hash plant a little bit the red Lebanese
hash plant is a great plant But in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion, it's a little bit wispy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be more sturdy more vigorous more
structurally sound Everything else is
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It roots quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buzz is fucking awesome Awesome and
real quickly side note sidebar somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: recently asked me if they're allowed to
smoke hash plants as flower Or if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: only for hash now, bro Enjoy the flower if
you grew that and they made good flower
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke it that way It's just it would also
make an excellent hash plant is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: why I got called got called hash plant And
yes, red line is a great washer presser
[SPEAKER_00]: all that good stuff by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the red Lebanese hash plant It's a
great hash plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that old-school skunky sort of a
turp to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only problem with it is It's not as
vigorous and structurally sound as I would
[SPEAKER_00]: prefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that old-world Just land race
sort of wispy funkiness to it But I knew
[SPEAKER_00]: that King Solomon would fix it and he
definitely did so I bred the King Solomon
[SPEAKER_00]: arise male To the red Lebanese hash plant
we made red line Let's talk about the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes that come out of that Most of
the phenotypes are gonna be bushy and wide
[SPEAKER_00]: but also tall but not as tall as a lot of
my stuff It's still gonna make a big
[SPEAKER_00]: apical dominant top Cuz that's what King
Solomon does but this one's gonna bush out
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit more because that's what the
red Lebanese hash plant does It's not
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna stretch as much it's gonna the other
one I said is gonna double in height this
[SPEAKER_00]: one not quite double but probably close
more like what's the word?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna two-thirds on he is about what
it's gonna do It's not gonna be as
[SPEAKER_00]: aggressively stretchy that 21 day stretch
isn't gonna come on and go shebang like
[SPEAKER_00]: the like the fist bump It's gonna stretch
and then just continue to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not gonna be fucking boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm stretchy out of control It's gonna do
it more slowly more controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're gonna get less of a stretch,
but it is gonna get tall If you top it I
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend to top the red line Take that
big apical dominant top out of there and
[SPEAKER_00]: top it and you will get a bush of amazing
beautiful buds Especially if you are
[SPEAKER_00]: trellising scrogging doing that sort of
work Then I definitely recommend topping
[SPEAKER_00]: it take that big top out of there You'll
get a lot more reaction from the plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: my opinion in my experience make it bushy
and spread it out It's a fast grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also a heavy feeder Don't feed it is
don't feed it as long as you would fist
[SPEAKER_00]: bump and I know you may not have both to
compare but the fist bump is going to need
[SPEAKER_00]: more feeding than the red line,
but again, it is a Moderately heavy feeder
[SPEAKER_00]: they can handle one of the good things
about red line is it can handle some
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature swings I don't recommend
getting your plants too hot or too cold
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do red line will take it very
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen red line get too cold in the
winter I've also seen red line get too hot
[SPEAKER_00]: in the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be able to handle both of
those without Getting too angry without
[SPEAKER_00]: slowing down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still tasted good at harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was still super productive Everything
was perfect even though we've had too hot
[SPEAKER_00]: and too cold and in fact I've done both
and the same grow because I'm in Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: I can really fuck up some plants here with
my environment and sometimes I really get
[SPEAKER_00]: that opportunity and I have done it So
I've tortured red line and it seems to
[SPEAKER_00]: handle all abuse and temperature very very
well I can take droughts I haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: overwatered it on purpose, but I would
assume since it's got King Solomon in
[SPEAKER_00]: there it can handle some bullshit it can
definitely take a Drought because I've
[SPEAKER_00]: drought tested it before all right now
Let's talk about flowering time for red
[SPEAKER_00]: line in most cases red line is going to
take Around nine or ten weeks to flower
[SPEAKER_00]: completely if you are flowering for
smokable flower Now a lot of people that
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to grow red line may grow it for
concentrates because this is a great
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate plant One thing you may notice
about red line is that in some phenotypes
[SPEAKER_00]: the trichomes do start to develop early
and these plants get frosty very early in
[SPEAKER_00]: the flowering phase now I Know a lot of
you concentrate makers you guys that wash
[SPEAKER_00]: the buds and then press it I know you guys
like to take the plants down early This
[SPEAKER_00]: may be very advantageous for you to cut
the plants down early because the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes start growing early Which means
they are starting to develop early,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means you might even be able to cut
down for concentrates even earlier So that
[SPEAKER_00]: may be advantageous for you concentrate
makers However, if you're growing for
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, I do recommend letting it go that
full recommended nine or ten weeks All
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now once again, let's wrap back around to
the main Point of this question our friend
[SPEAKER_00]: Richard was asking about the flavors and
aromas of red line So let's focus on that
[SPEAKER_00]: now The main thing I like about red line
is what I call the old world flavors and
[SPEAKER_00]: aromas Now I feel like everything tastes
like some sort of cake or some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: dessert There's some sort of little Debbie
snack or something at the gas station It
[SPEAKER_00]: all smells like that sort of snacks and
treats now back in the day weed smelled
[SPEAKER_00]: like weed It smelled like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smelled like ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smelled skunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smelled Earthy it had a hint of
spiciness to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a very warm distinct smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't hey, I smell blueberries with a
hint of muffins with a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: frosting with a touch of honey at the end
and it smelled like you might have used a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of too much worm castings and
then I can smell a little bit of What is
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's that bacon grease at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't do all that shit back in the day
We went damn that one's skunky or damn
[SPEAKER_00]: that one smells bad that's how it used to
be back in the day and the red line turps
[SPEAKER_00]: smell like old weed Did back in the day
it's got hints of gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got hints of skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that warm Spicy skunky smell to
it that weed had back in the day and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's really one of the things I love
about it So my favorite descriptive words
[SPEAKER_00]: for red line are going to be skunky Maybe
a little bit spicy and then warm weed
[SPEAKER_00]: remember when weed hits when the smell of
cannabis hits my nose The first thing I
[SPEAKER_00]: notice is warmth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells savory It doesn't smell like
candy most of the time and it's got that
[SPEAKER_00]: not candy smell to it now weed does smell
like Candy, but back in the day it was
[SPEAKER_00]: warm and savory and skunky and earthy
Maybe a little bit of like different
[SPEAKER_00]: spices from the from the kitchen might
have been in there But it didn't smell
[SPEAKER_00]: like candy and bubblegum and shit back in
the day That's what I think red line
[SPEAKER_00]: smells like his old school old world turps
old weed from back in the day Not in a bad
[SPEAKER_00]: way, but in a classic way that a lot of us
might miss before everything was blue
[SPEAKER_00]: dream and Girl Scout cookies and biscotti
and gelati and fucking skittles and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that It tasted like weed back in the day
and that's what red line tastes like in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my friend Richard, um, man Thank you
for the great questions You got me talking
[SPEAKER_00]: real good and you got me to highlight two
strains that a lot of listeners have
[SPEAKER_00]: really been waiting for some details on So
ladies and gentlemen boys and girls,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is my report on fist bump and red
line That's my story and I am sticking to
[SPEAKER_00]: it before I wrap this up I do want to give
a shout out to my friend Kevin Jodhuri
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to Kevin Jodhuri a lot of you
may know Kevin from the gonjie a Kevin's a
[SPEAKER_00]: Great dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a great teacher.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an amazing fucking grower a great
breeder a great dude all around I owe
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin a big shout out and a fist bump
shout out to my dude Kevin Jodhuri Kevin I
[SPEAKER_00]: look forward to smoking a joint with you
soon my dude, but anyway, Kevin Jodhuri
[SPEAKER_00]: has developed his um, I'm not sure what he
even calls it but he's got a way of
[SPEAKER_00]: breaking down flavors in the cannabis
industry and he has identified the main
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors in cannabis as earth fuel floral
and fruit and I definitely agree that that
[SPEAKER_00]: is probably the base There may be some
outliers in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure where everything would fall
into that But if you can name a flavor,
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet it would fit closely in that color
wheel So we'll talk about these a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit and this may in the future Help you
understand my descriptions of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: when I say it tastes earthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes feely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes like a mango What is what
Kevin's trying to do is create a language?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I say it tastes earthy you
understand what I mean instead of just
[SPEAKER_00]: going earth What the fuck does that taste
like so I'm gonna talk a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: about that briefly then we're gonna wrap
up this episode and go take some Dabs,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the four things Kevin talks about our
earth fuel floral and fruit now I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: try to talk about those flavors and maybe
name a strain to go with each one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: earthy um Bubba Kush pre-98 Bubba Kush San
Fernando Valley OG Kush Most of your cush
[SPEAKER_00]: is are going to have that earthy flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes a little bit like dirt You may
get a coffee flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it may translate to a chocolate
flavor Big Mountain fudge cake has got
[SPEAKER_00]: earthy coffee dirt turps to it so that is
where the I think that is where I think
[SPEAKER_00]: the earth comes in is that sort of a
flavor that like The the cushy stuff the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that tastes like dirt that smells
like coffee That is earth how I would
[SPEAKER_00]: translate it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one on the list is fuel fuel
We've all gotten gasoline, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all smelled diesel gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is fuel What strains smell like gas
and fuel sour diesel, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course that classic sour diesel smell
is called diesel because it's Smells like
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where the fuel comes from now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get creative here What if we had
earth and fuel together?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the chem family in my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where chem comes in the chem dogs
Chem four chem 91 chem sister.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are they've got a little bit of fuel
and a little bit of earth mixed in
[SPEAKER_00]: together That's where you're getting that
that that's where the the chem family
[SPEAKER_00]: lies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's chemicals So when you put earth and
fuel together, that's where the chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: fuel chemical smell and aroma comes from
in my mind I'm sure you guys Can see where
[SPEAKER_00]: this is going next.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got floral the floral flavors are
things like lavender and lilacs and The
[SPEAKER_00]: strain that comes to my mind Well,
I'll say lavender is the first strain that
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to my mind when we talk about floral
But if you if you smell lavender or lilacs
[SPEAKER_00]: in your brain That's the aromas that I
think of or roses even are floral that
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of flowery smell grandma's bathroom
That sort of smell that's a flowery sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of smell most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully Also scarlet begonias has a lot
of flowery Floral sort of turps to it in
[SPEAKER_00]: my opinion in my experience now the next
one on our list here is Fruit and I'm sure
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the people in the room understand
what I'm talking about when I say a fruity
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor What do I mean by fruit fruit can
be anything from lemons to strawberries to
[SPEAKER_00]: mangoes to watermelons?
[SPEAKER_00]: guavas kiwis Whatever fruit you can think
of Fruit that's a category of cannabis of
[SPEAKER_00]: ganja flavors of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're talking about what I'm
talking about These different flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to give us all like a
collective starting point to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm talking about and once again I
want to give a big shout out to my buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin Jodhuri for kind of listing and
establishing this baseline for naming
[SPEAKER_00]: these flavors This definitely helps us all
communicate better and together if we all
[SPEAKER_00]: know that when I say fruit I'm talking
about fruit and then we can expand on that
[SPEAKER_00]: by saying lemons or oranges or watermelons
or Mangoes or guavas or cherries we can we
[SPEAKER_00]: can make more categories from there,
but I think most things Are going to fit
[SPEAKER_00]: into these four categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I just wanted to touch on the way
that a lot of us in the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_00]: think about flavors and aromas and how we
describe it and try to get everybody on
[SPEAKER_00]: the page here so that when we talk about
turps We all kind of know what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about and I'm gonna rant about one
more thing just to make it fun You don't
[SPEAKER_00]: hear me talk about the word terpene
profile a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't hear me talk about turps a lot
You don't hear me say this strain is high
[SPEAKER_00]: in humaline this strain this strain is
high in terpenaline because the average
[SPEAKER_00]: bear the average cannabis consumer Doesn't
know what the fuck that means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, if I said yeah, this one smells a
lot like Terpenaline with some humaline in
[SPEAKER_00]: it and it's got some karyophylline in it
People are gonna go what the fuck is that
[SPEAKER_00]: dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I say yo this one tastes like lemon
diesel with a bit of honey in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go lemon I know what lemon tastes
like diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've smelled diesel feel before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay lemons and diesel That's good
together with a little bit of honey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that sounds nice or You know this one
tastes like chocolate cake with a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of vanilla frosting Your brain knows
what chocolate cake and vanilla frosting
[SPEAKER_00]: tastes like that That's why I try to
describe the things the way I do and I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't say this one smells like humaline
and karyophylline because Nobody knows
[SPEAKER_00]: what the fuck that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, that's my ramble for the day I am
