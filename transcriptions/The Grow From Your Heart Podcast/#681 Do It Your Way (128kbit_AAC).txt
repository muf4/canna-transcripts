of course invited i do want to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: quick disclaimer here first of all my
words are having trouble coming out today
[SPEAKER_00]: but also it is a super windy day here in
southern colorado we are having extreme
[SPEAKER_00]: winds if you hear weird noises in the
background i try to take out most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: noise with this processing gear here i
will try to do some more corrections in
[SPEAKER_00]: the computer when i edit but you may hear
some crazy noises coming through my air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioning vents there was debris and
stuff bashing against the house if you
[SPEAKER_00]: hear noises i do apologize speaking of
crazy wind tonight is the first cold night
[SPEAKER_00]: in colorado i've been complaining that it
is getting cold tonight it is officially
[SPEAKER_00]: cold i think i was just kidding before
when i was saying it was cold tonight
[SPEAKER_00]: mother nature is serious it's cold as shit
outside if you had plants outside that
[SPEAKER_00]: were not in a greenhouse or some sort of
protected environment tonight was the last
[SPEAKER_00]: night or today was the last day to cut
them down most of your plants are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: start experiencing problems they're going
to get too cold of course last year we saw
[SPEAKER_00]: some amazing shit but ideally plants would
be down by now if you've got an outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: environment if you've got a greenhouse
with some heaters or some tricks you may
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to keep those plants going but
tonight it is super cold everybody in
[SPEAKER_00]: southern colorado is in harvest mode
plants are coming down plants are getting
[SPEAKER_00]: trimmed jars are getting filled shelves
will be filled again soon it's a beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: time here in colorado but everybody is in
hurry up and harvest mode it is harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: time if you've been following around
following along you know that i do have a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse that had some plants in it i
say had because today was the day we
[SPEAKER_00]: finished harvesting the greenhouse all of
the plants are gone they're down they are
[SPEAKER_00]: safely chopped up and in a warm dry safe
place to where the weather cannot get to
[SPEAKER_00]: them and destroy the seeds that we made
i'm very proud of my uh my friends and my
[SPEAKER_00]: crew i want to call them my crew they're
my friends i'm very proud of my friends
[SPEAKER_00]: that did a really good job growing this
crop this year there are a lot of great
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds there will be uh let's see there
will be lady marmalade blue raspberry
[SPEAKER_00]: truffle restocks very soon we made a bunch
of those uh then there will be machine and
[SPEAKER_00]: sacca souffle seeds will drop sometime i
haven't uh picked a an exact drop date for
[SPEAKER_00]: those they were planned for the endo expo
right now once again there's no update on
[SPEAKER_00]: the endo expo so i don't know exactly when
i'm going to drop the machine and sacca
[SPEAKER_00]: souffle seeds coming soon stay tuned
you're excited about those i definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: will keep you updated but if you don't
have some winter gear going on and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing you might want to consider getting
all your plants down if you have not
[SPEAKER_00]: already because it is frosty cold here in
colorado i had to fire up the heater uh
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a heater here in this recording
space going feels kind of nice you could
[SPEAKER_00]: probably hear that thing making noise too
got a long sleeve hoodie on it's for real
[SPEAKER_00]: cold today nature is not fucking around
now i did mention that i had some friends
[SPEAKER_00]: and a crew working a greenhouse that kind
of leads me into one of the topics i want
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk about on this episode of the show
the reason that greenhouse worked is
[SPEAKER_00]: because i let those growers do their thing
these people had a greenhouse that was
[SPEAKER_00]: already set up they've been running the
greenhouse for years we spoke i said hey i
[SPEAKER_00]: want to make some seeds in your greenhouse
they said that sounds like a really good
[SPEAKER_00]: idea we were came to a beautiful agreement
uh they did a bunch of work on the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: i gave some great guidance did some
hands-on work showed them some things some
[SPEAKER_00]: tricks some tips uh gave them a good
strategy but for the most part i honestly
[SPEAKER_00]: stayed out of the way and let them grow
it's their greenhouse they know the flow
[SPEAKER_00]: they know uh who is good at what who likes
to do what they've got their systems and
[SPEAKER_00]: their ideas and their sops in place they
were doing a different design a different
[SPEAKER_00]: grill because they usually of course don't
produce seeds in their product they
[SPEAKER_00]: usually have a a sensei bud a seedless bud
but this year they were making seeds for
[SPEAKER_00]: me so there were some changes to be made
but with very minimal guidance my crew my
[SPEAKER_00]: team my friends were able to produce high
quality seeds mainly i think because i
[SPEAKER_00]: stayed out of the way and let them work
with their style and their flow i could
[SPEAKER_00]: have gone in and i did of course i took
notes on things that i didn't like and i
[SPEAKER_00]: made suggestions and we made corrections
as we went it was all friendly it was like
[SPEAKER_00]: hey i see that you're doing this what's
your reason and they would give me a
[SPEAKER_00]: reason i would say cool reason i
understand but i've been doing it for a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time and this is what that is going
to cause i saw one thing they're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: do to prevent one problem but it was going
to cause two more problems we had a quick
[SPEAKER_00]: team meeting and we quickly agreed let's
not do this i'd rather have small problem
[SPEAKER_00]: a than compounding problems b and c so
there were a couple of quick meetings a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of observations i took notes i
thought of things that we can improve next
[SPEAKER_00]: year we've already talked about that but
honestly i stayed out of their way and
[SPEAKER_00]: just let them do their thing because they
are experienced cannabis growers they have
[SPEAKER_00]: developed their system they've developed
their sops also that's their greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: they know they knew what weather to expect
they knew where the hot pockets in the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow was not the hot pockets we eat you
guys the warm spots in the grow some
[SPEAKER_00]: people right now are getting the munchies
because i said that but free advertising
[SPEAKER_00]: there you go eat something better for you
but they knew all the problems and the
[SPEAKER_00]: niches of the grow they knew where all the
switches all the bells all the whistles if
[SPEAKER_00]: we wanted to turn on something they knew
where that button was so it's their place
[SPEAKER_00]: what i'm getting at is i see a lot of
people on social media trying to give
[SPEAKER_00]: people instructions and they say you need
to do this or you must do this and they
[SPEAKER_00]: give crazy crazy advice what i want to say
is do things your way and it will work
[SPEAKER_00]: there are a few rules of growing cannabis
basically keep them alive water them give
[SPEAKER_00]: them proper light and then if you have a
successful harvest that you are happy with
[SPEAKER_00]: you did it right if the plants don't die
you're doing it correctly you can do
[SPEAKER_00]: things better you can do things
differently but if you have a harvested
[SPEAKER_00]: outcome you did it right if you were
satisfied with it what we can always do is
[SPEAKER_00]: work on improving what we have done the
first time the second time the third time
[SPEAKER_00]: your first grow allow your first grow to
be a total train wreck that way you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: some learning and some experience from it
if that first grow comes off perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: you're never going to learn anything your
ego is going to get big you're going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: i can grow we let's just do it and your
next grow is going to suck because you got
[SPEAKER_00]: egotistical and you didn't have any
mistakes if you have some adversity you
[SPEAKER_00]: learn a lot more so let me get back on my
notes because i do have some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: direction here what i'm what i'm trying to
get to is do things your way you're
[SPEAKER_00]: learning from me you're probably learning
from books other podcasters maybe your
[SPEAKER_00]: friends listen to all of us take all of
our information then turn it into your
[SPEAKER_00]: thing you're hearing a lot of different
things a lot of getting a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: input kind of translate that interpret it
how you would like and make it your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: that grow space is yours design it the way
you want grow the plants you want grow the
[SPEAKER_00]: style you want these plants do require
some love and some care and some attention
[SPEAKER_00]: for a top-notch harvest but don't expect
your first harvest to be amazing you
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't developed your skill yet you
haven't developed your style yet and also
[SPEAKER_00]: don't expect that grow to be exactly like
mine it doesn't have to be my grow do your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow the way you want develop your style
develop your skill set then it will all
[SPEAKER_00]: come together learn make some mistakes
kill some plants over water some things
[SPEAKER_00]: over feed some things under feed some
things get all the way to the harvest and
[SPEAKER_00]: then mess up the dry and cure experience
all of the pitfalls and mistakes that a
[SPEAKER_00]: grower can make I've done a full episode
about making mistakes because I've made
[SPEAKER_00]: plenty of them that's why I'm a good
grower I think that if I had never made
[SPEAKER_00]: any mistakes I've said it before I
wouldn't be as good of a grower as I think
[SPEAKER_00]: I am now I can problem solve now I can
correct issues on the fly now I can
[SPEAKER_00]: anticipate and predict problems like I
said a moment ago we were gonna correct
[SPEAKER_00]: problem A but I knew it would make problem
B and C happen so we just stick with
[SPEAKER_00]: problem A and try to mitigate that as much
as possible I can anticipate and predict
[SPEAKER_00]: the issues that will arise in the grow
room from experience if you stick with
[SPEAKER_00]: your craft and pay attention and fall in
love with this craft and do it with
[SPEAKER_00]: passion and take notes and dedication is
the word I'm looking for you will develop
[SPEAKER_00]: the skills the same skill set that I've
got I'm nobody special I'm just some dude
[SPEAKER_00]: just like you or you're maybe some lady
some female or maybe whatever spectrum you
[SPEAKER_00]: find yourself in I'm just a person and
I've done a lot of research and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: passionate about my craft there's nothing
stopping you from becoming this
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledgeable and skillful with this plant
in a grow you can achieve this just learn
[SPEAKER_00]: pay attention you might not be growing yet
you may be semi experienced you may be a
[SPEAKER_00]: better grower than me but there's always
something to learn and your style is
[SPEAKER_00]: always developing so don't think that your
first grow has to be the best don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: that that's your last grow that's your
first grow that's the one you should make
[SPEAKER_00]: mistakes on if you make mistakes on like
the ninth and tenth grow that's when we go
[SPEAKER_00]: hey is this person ever gonna learn are
they just gonna keep driving into the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking wall make some mistakes on that
first second and third grow so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know like oops I overfed I saw crispy
leaves I underfed I saw pale leaves I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't water one day and I got droopy ass
plants I over water the next day I got
[SPEAKER_00]: clawed and fucked up plants then start
learning to identify signs of heat stress
[SPEAKER_00]: cold stress other stresses start then
you'll start seeing bugs you won't go what
[SPEAKER_00]: are these spots on my plants and you wait
two weeks to treat for spider mites
[SPEAKER_00]: because you didn't even know they were
mites just develop that relationship get
[SPEAKER_00]: in there play with the plants learn some
skills kill some shit that's where I was
[SPEAKER_00]: make some mistakes I've made crucial
mistakes and big and small grows let's
[SPEAKER_00]: make all of these mistakes early on so
that we can get them out of the way get
[SPEAKER_00]: them under our belt learn from them get a
little embarrassment get a little humbling
[SPEAKER_00]: from it and then have that lesson in your
tool belt to move forward with in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future to prevent us from making that
mistake again also that may help you
[SPEAKER_00]: predict and anticipate other mistakes that
you may make you may be like hey I did
[SPEAKER_00]: something similar to this that one time
let me read my notes and then I'll have a
[SPEAKER_00]: big circle with an X on it like don't ever
do this dumb shit again because it made
[SPEAKER_00]: all the plants go crazy like take some
notes and learn a lot about what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing let me get on my notes because I'm
rambling in stone today this should be
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoyable and educational when I see
people telling people that they have to do
[SPEAKER_00]: some shit or that they must do this or
just random instructions I'm like you're
[SPEAKER_00]: just sucking the enjoyment out of the
plants let this person grow the way that
[SPEAKER_00]: they want to grow and develop their style
and their system and their flow of growing
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll become a good grower you'll have
your own system your style every grower
[SPEAKER_00]: walks into the grow and we've got like a
routine you do this and then you do this
[SPEAKER_00]: this is how I mix this is how I feed this
is how I do this this is what I check on
[SPEAKER_00]: these are the notes I take this is my
cleanup procedure clock out go home
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone's got their little system you
will develop yours that will work for you
[SPEAKER_00]: your system doesn't have to be like my
system it doesn't have to be like the dude
[SPEAKER_00]: system it doesn't have to be Scotty real
system it doesn't have to be guru system
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't have to be anybody from any
other podcast system or any other
[SPEAKER_00]: professional grower you've ever seen it
can be your system make it a hybrid of all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the systems that you've seen I always
recommend starting off simple and
[SPEAKER_00]: expanding there but start with the system
that gets your attention something will
[SPEAKER_00]: get your attention when it comes to
growing a strain that you want to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: will get your attention a system will get
your attention a light will get your
[SPEAKER_00]: attention when you do a little research
delve into it all of the things will come
[SPEAKER_00]: together your setup your style in your
system will kind of develop itself and it
[SPEAKER_00]: will be a beautiful enjoyable experience
it'll be your comfort zone once you get
[SPEAKER_00]: that grow dialed in it will be where you
retreat to get away from all of the crap
[SPEAKER_00]: in your life you'll be like ah something
stressful I'm going to the grow and you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: just go hang out in there and it will feel
good you'll forget about all the other
[SPEAKER_00]: shit that's going on in life sometimes I
say I'm gonna go in the grow and just hang
[SPEAKER_00]: out for like 30 minutes maybe pull some
leaves see if I can find anything that I
[SPEAKER_00]: can do just look for work in there and
then I realize oh yeah I've just listened
[SPEAKER_00]: to like seven seven podcasts in here and I
haven't really done anything I'm just like
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling leaves and popping stems and just
just finding light work to do but time
[SPEAKER_00]: will just go by in there it's such a
beautiful place it smells good the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature is perfect the humidity is
perfect the music is perfect the company
[SPEAKER_00]: is great it's a great place to be so build
your Zen space and have fun in there make
[SPEAKER_00]: it educational and comforting and relaxing
and enjoyable don't make it stressful
[SPEAKER_00]: because people on the internet say you
have to top that plant you have to up pop
[SPEAKER_00]: those your lights are wrong everyone's got
an opinion don't let it bother you do your
[SPEAKER_00]: thing just do it your way of course if the
plants are dying and if shit is failing
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe take some advice but if it's working
and if it's only your first try do your
[SPEAKER_00]: thing and don't be afraid to make some
mistakes don't let people intimidate you
[SPEAKER_00]: the internet the internet tries to scare
and intimidate people making them think
[SPEAKER_00]: they have to do a lot of shit that's not
necessary don't worry about that do what
[SPEAKER_00]: you can do I do my best not to intimidate
you there are a lot of pieces of equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: to be involved in a grow there are a lot
of skills a lot of steps a lot of things
[SPEAKER_00]: to be involved in a grow I try to go
slowly and not scare you away with the
[SPEAKER_00]: cost and all the requirements I try to go
real slowly and invite you I want it to be
[SPEAKER_00]: welcoming and enjoyable for you so keep it
that way don't make it stressful let me
[SPEAKER_00]: catch up on my notes sometimes you will
have to adjust and adapt your space and
[SPEAKER_00]: your schedule and your budget and your
style and your goal just adjust sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: the things you tried to do might not work
out after that first or second grow if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're seeing that something isn't working
adjust and adapt don't be stubborn I've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen people try to make shit work if it
doesn't work it just doesn't work let's
[SPEAKER_00]: adapt adjust and correct things and set
ourselves up for success instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: spending money on lights soil water
nutrients maybe you wasted seeds maybe you
[SPEAKER_00]: wasted clones let's quit wasting things I
do have another episode planned and
[SPEAKER_00]: prepared to talk about how to save some
money and budget better in the grow so
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll talk about that in the future but
people make growing really stressful and I
[SPEAKER_00]: see the internet trying to make growing
stressful on new growers trying to prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: that let's keep it fun you guys let's just
keep it a good time it should be
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic relaxing should be the Zen
zone I can make a big grow fun and
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoyable we run large grows with multiple
hundred lights 500 lights and 20 people
[SPEAKER_00]: working and we're having a good time we
got the music up super loud we're
[SPEAKER_00]: high-fiving each other when we get a row
of clones done we all do the Ric Flair
[SPEAKER_00]: whoo because we're all excited about it I
try to make a big environment exciting and
[SPEAKER_00]: all that takes is just building a flow
building a system having a team that
[SPEAKER_00]: communicates and all knows what the final
goal is and then just having a good
[SPEAKER_00]: attitude and setting yourself up for
success every day today you're setting
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself up for success tomorrow that's
not just in the grow that's everywhere but
[SPEAKER_00]: in the grow you can see it if you don't do
the side work tonight before you leave
[SPEAKER_00]: tomorrow you've got to do the side work
before you can even start doing the real
[SPEAKER_00]: work so you're just rushing to get to the
real work then you got to do the real work
[SPEAKER_00]: in a rush then you don't get the side work
done again tonight because you fucked up
[SPEAKER_00]: and had to rush everything then there's
always a surprise in a commercial grow
[SPEAKER_00]: always a surprise I teach the new guys I
say this a lot when I train a new guy in a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial grow I just have them shadow me
for a day and as we walk in I always say
[SPEAKER_00]: the first thing we're gonna do is find out
what went wrong last night what pumped
[SPEAKER_00]: broke what light went out there's a lot of
moving parts in a 500 light grow a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: things can break let's go find out what
happened last night that's usually the
[SPEAKER_00]: first thing we do we still keep it fun we
still keep it enjoyable because that's I
[SPEAKER_00]: love the plants that is that is the main
the main part is to have fun and enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: this shit and the plants I think the
plants can feel your vibes do you ever
[SPEAKER_00]: walk into a grow and you just feel that
life force that presence that energy that
[SPEAKER_00]: is the plants why can't the plants feel it
from us as well if you're walking in there
[SPEAKER_00]: anxious disheveled nervous rushed the
plants feel that what if you went to the
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor or the dentist and the dentist had
like a distracted rushed disheveled feel
[SPEAKER_00]: or like they felt like they had to just
hurry up and get shit done you might not
[SPEAKER_00]: go to that dentist you may be like can I
come back tomorrow like I'd rather come
[SPEAKER_00]: back when you've got time to like sit down
and look at my tooth and actually do the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff instead of like drill it fill it
stitch me up send me on my way and
[SPEAKER_00]: high-five me that that that's not what I
need from a dentist I want some love and
[SPEAKER_00]: care take your time the plants enjoy that
too and they can feel it from you all
[SPEAKER_00]: right I'm gonna catch up on these notes
I'm stoned and rambling I want to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure I got all the important parts here
make it enjoyable and educational those
[SPEAKER_00]: are the words that I have in bold there's
no exact way to grow cannabis the exact
[SPEAKER_00]: way is the way that's working for you I've
seen it done a billion different ways and
[SPEAKER_00]: guess what I've seen a billion successful
outcomes so whatever is working for you do
[SPEAKER_00]: that shit don't let anyone on the internet
scare you don't let them tell you you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it wrong don't let them talk shit to
you let them give you constructive
[SPEAKER_00]: criticism and then learn how to filter out
all the bullshit the internet is full of
[SPEAKER_00]: crap and you're gonna get some terrible
terrible advice always ask why when you
[SPEAKER_00]: when somebody gives you advice just say
why and see if they can tell you why if
[SPEAKER_00]: they say because my uncle Larry did it in
the 70s and it worked that's not why
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just because uncle Larry did it
maybe uncle Larry's plants are way
[SPEAKER_00]: different than yours maybe you're growing
indoors uncle Larry was outdoors maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in the northern hemisphere to Larry
was in the southern shit could be way
[SPEAKER_00]: different you never know all right I feel
like I got good and rambly on that I did
[SPEAKER_00]: say that I've got an update from a
previous episode let's jump into that part
[SPEAKER_00]: here try to get myself on some sort of a
track all right in a previous episode we
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about trellising our plants we had
a listener or a viewer who wanted to use a
[SPEAKER_00]: 5x5 grow tent they wanted to trellis their
plants or have some sort of supports for
[SPEAKER_00]: their buds but if they put up the trellis
they were unable to get to the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: properly we have had some follow-up
conversations from that viewer from that
[SPEAKER_00]: listener what they have decided to do is
build the trellis system and an auto
[SPEAKER_00]: watering system and just suck it up their
next question was about co2 which I will
[SPEAKER_00]: address in a future episode today let's
talk about the update on the trellis
[SPEAKER_00]: question there was one piece that I
greatly overlooked there's a grower that
[SPEAKER_00]: taught me how to take big pots and build
an individual trellis on each pot I think
[SPEAKER_00]: what he was using was a 30 gallon tote
that he would put on wheels or on casters
[SPEAKER_00]: and then he would fill the 30 gallon tote
with a soilless mix or a soil put some
[SPEAKER_00]: holes in the bottom of that for drainage
then he would use that soilless mix bed as
[SPEAKER_00]: like a big raised bed then he would build
a trellis system out of PVC piping you
[SPEAKER_00]: would put two four posts one post in each
corner four posts in there kind of build
[SPEAKER_00]: like a table and then put a net into the
table and then slowly lower that onto the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and trellis the plants out with
that net that allowed him to move his
[SPEAKER_00]: plants around he could move them around
the tent around the room around the
[SPEAKER_00]: facility and he could have them trellised
out properly so it is possible to build
[SPEAKER_00]: trellis netting for individual plants I'm
not sure why I didn't think about that in
[SPEAKER_00]: the first episode when we talked about
this but as I was listening and editing I
[SPEAKER_00]: was like oh you didn't even talk about the
opportunity to trellis your big plants by
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves in a tent so you could just use
like a 30 gallon container I think it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 gallon like a stir light bin or a
Rubbermaid bin just I think it's 30
[SPEAKER_00]: gallons I'm pretty sure that's what it is
they're about 30 inches by 20 by about 15
[SPEAKER_00]: fill that up with your soilless mix or
whatever you want to use put plenty of
[SPEAKER_00]: holes in the bottom for drainage put it on
casters you could roll that around then
[SPEAKER_00]: you just build a little square frame it's
a rectangle it's kind of like a table
[SPEAKER_00]: basically you can get creative with that
as long as you got posts in each corner
[SPEAKER_00]: then maybe extend it so it's wider because
your plant will be wider than that pot if
[SPEAKER_00]: you do things correctly but make some
extenders make it go higher longer however
[SPEAKER_00]: you need it then just use that PVC frame
put your trellis net right on there you
[SPEAKER_00]: can trellis your individual plants of
course those are gigantic plants those are
[SPEAKER_00]: big but that does work recently while
shopping at a big box hardware store I
[SPEAKER_00]: know I shouldn't go to the big box stores
but it was my only option I did see a 16
[SPEAKER_00]: inch tomato cage with a built-in trellis
on the top that's right the top layer of
[SPEAKER_00]: the tomato cage had a square grid built
onto the top of it so if you want to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: small individual trellis system that would
be a great way to do it just pull one bud
[SPEAKER_00]: through each square have a nice even
canopy going on there that would be a
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful idea all right that was my
update for the trellising episode I did
[SPEAKER_00]: want to make sure to include those two
pieces you can trellis individual pots by
[SPEAKER_00]: building a PVC trellis or you can use the
pre-made circle tomato cage with the
[SPEAKER_00]: trellis on top I've also seen people put
sticks in each corner use a twisty tie or
[SPEAKER_00]: that garden tape and just build like a
spiral up and use that to put the branches
[SPEAKER_00]: in place get creative you guys once again
there's no wrong way to do it as long as
