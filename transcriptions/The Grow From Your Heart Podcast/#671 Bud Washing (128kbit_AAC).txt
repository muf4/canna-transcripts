quickly I do want to apologize that the
[SPEAKER_00]: last episode was shorter than normal I did
cut out a good chunk of that episode I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know if you noticed my magical
editing skills I removed a good portion of
[SPEAKER_00]: that show that I felt I got way off track
and I was basically talking to and for
[SPEAKER_00]: myself and I didn't want to punish you by
leaving that in the show so I cut it out
[SPEAKER_00]: so I apologize for the short show
sometimes a short quick episode is better
[SPEAKER_00]: than a long bullshitted episode it's
easier just to come in and say here's the
[SPEAKER_00]: point here's the lesson here's how you do
it wish you success I'm out have a good
[SPEAKER_00]: day there's no need for me just to sit
here and extend shit just to make the
[SPEAKER_00]: episode look longer on YouTube quality
over quantity and I've got ADD you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: ADD maybe that short episode was exactly
what we needed if you need a longer
[SPEAKER_00]: episode listen to two or I've got plenty
of friends out there doing podcasts that
[SPEAKER_00]: you will enjoy as well but I do apologize
for the short show try to keep it good try
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep it tight I felt like I had to cut
out some bullshit that was for all of our
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit all right where do we go from here
I want to give a big thank you shout out
[SPEAKER_00]: fist bump hug high five smile spread some
vibes to all of the friends and family
[SPEAKER_00]: that I saw at the fish concerts in Denver
over the weekend that's right I try not to
[SPEAKER_00]: brag boast too much about the amazing shit
that I get to do in my life but if you
[SPEAKER_00]: know me if we're friends and if not here's
a little insight into my life fish is my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite band I've got a few bands that I
really enjoy fish with a pH pH ish if you
[SPEAKER_00]: never heard of them check them out fish is
my favorite band there's nothing like it
[SPEAKER_00]: no two shows will ever be the same every
show is different they never play the same
[SPEAKER_00]: songs within like a week so if they played
your favorite song Friday you won't hear
[SPEAKER_00]: it again until next Friday if you're lucky
I went I got to go see I went saw fish for
[SPEAKER_00]: three nights in a row at Dick's sporting
goods the big soccer field in Denver and
[SPEAKER_00]: Commerce City and I had the time of my
freaking life we've been on this weird uh
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even like to talk about quarantine
and all the weird shit we've been going
[SPEAKER_00]: through for the past two years we've been
locked down it's been nice to get out and
[SPEAKER_00]: dance and boogie and see some fucking
music it was such a good time you guys I
[SPEAKER_00]: feel so good about it but part of the fun
fish is a big part of the fun fish is why
[SPEAKER_00]: we go the band fish puts on a great show
they play great music in my opinion they
[SPEAKER_00]: put me in a great mindset that's only a
portion of the event a big portion of that
[SPEAKER_00]: event is going and seeing old friends
catching up with old friends there are
[SPEAKER_00]: some people I only see at fish shows there
are some people that I see often but we
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely know we'll see each other at
fish shows and then there are people that
[SPEAKER_00]: I meet for the first time at fish shows
and it is a wonderful experience doing all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the above seeing the old crew meeting
the new crew and then just seeing the fish
[SPEAKER_00]: crew is always a beautiful experience so I
want to send a big shout out a big thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you a big hug a high five a funky dance
move to all of the people that I bumped
[SPEAKER_00]: into at fish if we spent the week and
grooving and a section together big shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out to section 107 big up you guys held it
down everybody in 107 if we hung out and
[SPEAKER_00]: got down together big fist bump I'm not
gonna even try to remember all the names
[SPEAKER_00]: but even the people who thought I'd forget
their names Pete and Leandro I remember
[SPEAKER_00]: bro but I got all your names in my heads
big shout out to all those great folks I
[SPEAKER_00]: got your business cards we will be in
touch if we were brand new friends that
[SPEAKER_00]: was a great time if you walked by and gave
me a high five a fist bump a nod a hug
[SPEAKER_00]: just tap me on the shoulder and gave me a
thumbs up if you walked by and said great
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast however you did it thank you I
appreciate it I was having a good ass time
[SPEAKER_00]: I was dancing to fish and I was having a
good time I was trying not to interrupt
[SPEAKER_00]: the fish experience to talk to people but
the people I did talk with between sets
[SPEAKER_00]: and during set break beautiful time thank
you and again shout out to everybody for
[SPEAKER_00]: the fist bumps the high fives the hugs the
handshakes the stickers the treats the
[SPEAKER_00]: snacks the food I was given gifts and food
and drinks and people just they saw what I
[SPEAKER_00]: was drinking and they saw that my beverage
was low and they came out of nowhere with
[SPEAKER_00]: a fresh beverage for me and I was like
you're fucking people are amazing at fish
[SPEAKER_00]: shows so it's a really good time I met
some new people people from all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: place I got to see a friend who has lived
in like Thailand and Vietnam and shit for
[SPEAKER_00]: the past few years I don't think I've seen
him since probably ten years ago at a fish
[SPEAKER_00]: show so I got to bump into that guy we
gave each other a hug we talked for a few
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes talked about some future endeavors
and he skedaddled off to go back into the
[SPEAKER_00]: fish show and do his thing so he's out
there having a good time I met some great
[SPEAKER_00]: folks from Hawaii some folks from Indiana
some folks from PA there's folks from
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere we had a good time I'm gonna
quit gushing about the fish show obviously

[SPEAKER_00]: big vibes big weird dance moves to all of
you folks now let's move on to the main
[SPEAKER_00]: topic of this podcast I know I get rambly
at the start of the show sometimes people
[SPEAKER_00]: do complain about in the comments that I
get rambly at the start of the show it
[SPEAKER_00]: takes five minutes to get into it but
guess what it's a podcast it's free and I
[SPEAKER_00]: do get a little rambly I'm trying to find
a rhythm I'm finding my space I'm finding
[SPEAKER_00]: my zone I think it feels better than just
going one two three here we go talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about bud washing I try to get comfortable
bring you in some people want to hang out
[SPEAKER_00]: if not bro hit that fast forward button
get to the part or don't whatever anyway
[SPEAKER_00]: see that's the kind of stuff I cut out of
the last episode I'm not gonna cut that
[SPEAKER_00]: out of this one the main topic of today's
episode is bud washing and that's a bud
[SPEAKER_00]: washing with a D washing your buds that's
right you should already be washing
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else today we're gonna learn
about bud washing I'm discovering that a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people are experiencing problems in
their outdoor grow early this year I did
[SPEAKER_00]: predict a lot of powdery mildew happening
in outdoor grows because if we've had
[SPEAKER_00]: really drastic changes here in Colorado
we've had hot days cold nights and lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: rain and that does add up to powdery
mildew situations powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: environments I've seen a lot of people on
social media posting about their powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew laden buds and they're asking how
do I get rid of this then perfectly timed
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this email on the iRegenetics
website where there is the grow help tab
[SPEAKER_00]: really quickly we'll talk about that if
you go to iregenetics.com there is a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: help tab you can click on that and it
gives you about 12 preliminary questions
[SPEAKER_00]: asking about your garden those few
questions help me diagnose your grow then
[SPEAKER_00]: we give you the opportunity to type in
what's wrong with your grow then you send
[SPEAKER_00]: that to me and I will find that in my
email and I will read it and we'll solve
[SPEAKER_00]: your problem here on the show so go to the
website iregenetics.com go to the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: help tab that's where this came from this
one came from name to use on the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: is Indicalla or Indicaia if it's Spanish
we'll say it's Indicalla they're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: some Mephisto Sour Stomper and creme de la
cam and gnome automatics a lot of this is
[SPEAKER_00]: unnecessary to read all this info here
we're gonna jump right to it said I love
[SPEAKER_00]: your show I'm a new grower and you've
helped me figure out how to do this and I
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate it big respect bro thank you
for listening I hope I'm able to help you
[SPEAKER_00]: out with your first interaction here it
says I know it's a ton of work and I just
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to let you know I appreciate your
effort thank you there is a point to this
[SPEAKER_00]: question it says I don't have a grow
problem as much as a general question I
[SPEAKER_00]: get why bud washing makes sense on outdoor
grows and it's logical that outdoor buds
[SPEAKER_00]: can be covered and stuff we don't want to
put into our bodies my question for you is
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is a very good question it says
what is your take on bud washing on indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: grows I've seen some claim even indoor
buds are improved by washing I've read
[SPEAKER_00]: okay so we're gonna talk about bud washing
and this person is asking about bud
[SPEAKER_00]: washing indoors and then it says you would
be surprised how much grime comes off the
[SPEAKER_00]: buds even in seemingly controlled
environments yes I do agree we I do agree
[SPEAKER_00]: that we gather a lot of funky stuff on
those buds you never know what could be on
[SPEAKER_00]: there there could be bugs there could be
bug poop we're gonna talk about that in a
[SPEAKER_00]: moment but I do agree that sometimes it is
beneficial to wash indoor buds what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to talk about will be applicable to
indoor and or outdoor products so keep
[SPEAKER_00]: that in mind so this next comment I found
on YouTube and it was done right after I
[SPEAKER_00]: did the pest management episode and it's
referring to using predatory pests so if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got if you've got a pest problem
and you use another pest to attack that
[SPEAKER_00]: bug the obvious question was don't all
things that eat poop so the question is
[SPEAKER_00]: are those predatory pests going to poop
out the carcasses of the bug that they ate
[SPEAKER_00]: into my plants which is a very good
question it says who wants to smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: half-eaten bugs and the poop so that is a
very good question and that is a very good
[SPEAKER_00]: reason to do bud washing so that is part
of what inspired this episode was two
[SPEAKER_00]: great emails and a bunch of social media
chatter about bud washing so now that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: set it up let's get right to it bud
washing what do I mean by bud washing
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes your buds will be infested with
powdery mildew unfortunately it does
[SPEAKER_00]: happen sometimes we just want to clean off
the buds and get that powdery mildew off
[SPEAKER_00]: of there and the buds will be safe to
consume some people are going to argue
[SPEAKER_00]: with me now some people are going to have
varying opinions in my opinion if that bud
[SPEAKER_00]: has if the flowered plant has a little bit
of powdery mildew on those leaves I think
[SPEAKER_00]: we can wash that powdery mildew off with
bud washing it is not something that I
[SPEAKER_00]: would like to do that I would rely on that
I would do on a regular basis but in some
[SPEAKER_00]: emergency cases especially this year's
outdoor crop this may be necessary also
[SPEAKER_00]: this may be beneficial to people who grow
for extraction if you want your
[SPEAKER_00]: extractions to be as clean as they can be
why not wash off the product that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to extract before you put it through
the extraction process if you don't put
[SPEAKER_00]: dirt grime dust bug shit bug poop into
your extraction machines you don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: take that out of the process you don't
have to clean it up and take that out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the final product so bud washing sometimes
you get powdery mildew often there are
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs on your plants often there are bug
eggs like this person said anything that
[SPEAKER_00]: is laying eggs or eating another bug is
also going to take a shit so you got some
[SPEAKER_00]: bug shit to go into your plants now
oftentimes outdoors you will discover bird
[SPEAKER_00]: poop on your plants there's not much you
can do about that unless you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse birds are going to fly over
they're going to drop a turd and sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to land right on your plants
I've got a good way to wash that off this
[SPEAKER_00]: is very effective for that sometimes you
get spider webs outside sometimes a spider
[SPEAKER_00]: says hey I see shit flying around here
there's a lot of plants attracting a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of things I'm going to build a web from
this plant to this plant everything that
[SPEAKER_00]: flies through fucking dinner for the next
couple of weeks until they harvest you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: get spider webs then you will get dust and
dirt now it's a good time for me to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: quick disclaimer if you hear the weirdness
in my nose that sorry for that that was
[SPEAKER_00]: really rude but if you hear the weird
nasally sound in my voice that is because
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent three days on a dirt parking lot
sucking up dirt and dust and I have got a
[SPEAKER_00]: little nasal thing happening I feel fine I
feel good but there's a lot of dirt in my
[SPEAKER_00]: nose and it kind of wrecked me so there's
a lot of dirt and dust on the grow in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and they're sticky they're
trichomes so the powdery mildew the bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: the bug eggs the bug poop the bird poop
spider webs dust and dirt and then who
[SPEAKER_00]: knows what else who knows what else maybe
who even knows what else is stuck to those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants it could be anything outdoors right
you see weird shit cocoons and fucking bug
[SPEAKER_00]: eggs and weird larvae and things could be
stuck to those whatever the wind blew by
[SPEAKER_00]: could be stuck to your plants so why not
wash that stuff off it would be a really
[SPEAKER_00]: good idea if you're gonna smoke it eat it
consume it make extracts off of it we'd
[SPEAKER_00]: wash our fruits and vegetables right if I
handed you tomato or a cucumber or an
[SPEAKER_00]: avocado whatever is gonna be you'd wash it
before you cut it need it right we should
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly maybe consider doing that with
our products especially if they've got
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew bug eggs poop bird poop
spider webs dust and dirt something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that on it why not clean it up now let's
get to the we know why and we know the
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons to do it let's get to how to do it
we would harvest just like normal alright
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest your plants just like normal you
got your plant it's cut down your normal
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest process then you've got to cut the
buds into manageable pieces I like to cut
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant down to where I've got a bud and
a stick and then at the end of that stick
[SPEAKER_00]: I leave a hook so essentially what I'm
doing is I'm taking the main stalk of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and cutting it above the node so
there would be the main stalk goes up and
[SPEAKER_00]: a node would come off at an angle and then
if you cut right below where that node
[SPEAKER_00]: comes off you've just left yourself a
hanger so when it's time to hang that bud
[SPEAKER_00]: up you can use that little V section as a
natural hanger for your plant you'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: this when it comes time to cut your plant
cut below the node you'll leave a little
[SPEAKER_00]: hanger you can just leave a the main stock
will become the the short piece of the
[SPEAKER_00]: hanger and the branch with the buds will
become the the branch with the bud it will
[SPEAKER_00]: all make sense so I cut them into
manageable pieces for me I'm going to use
[SPEAKER_00]: a five gallon bucket for my bud washing I
need pieces that are shorter than a five
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon bucket so I can dunk them all the
way in there my goal is to get all the bud
[SPEAKER_00]: matter all the bud material into the five
gallon bucket so I'm going to harvest like
[SPEAKER_00]: normal I'm probably going to before
harvest I would normally go and pull off a
[SPEAKER_00]: majority of the large powdery mildew laden
fan leaves all the big leaves with the
[SPEAKER_00]: petiole before harvest you could just go
in and strip as many leaves off as you can
[SPEAKER_00]: get go take off the leaves don't get
aggressive and fuck up the buds take off
[SPEAKER_00]: all the leaves strip them destroy those
leaves they've got powdery mildew get them
[SPEAKER_00]: out of there maybe wear a mask while
you're doing this definitely wear gloves
[SPEAKER_00]: stay safe get in there and defoliate cut
down your plants cut them into manageable
[SPEAKER_00]: pieces leave sticks so you can hang them
after they are dunked then this is where
[SPEAKER_00]: when we're going to actually start
cleaning up the buds one more thing I
[SPEAKER_00]: should mention gloves we're going to use a
five gallon bucket filled with water you
[SPEAKER_00]: can use regular tap water RO water that
doesn't matter too much to me we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to add 25 to 50 milliliters of 30 percent
hydrogen peroxide to five gallons of water
[SPEAKER_00]: let me repeat that that is 25 to 50
milliliters per five gallons you can go
[SPEAKER_00]: harder if you want but I would start light
see if it's washing off the pm see if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: solving the problem if not go harder go
harder until you see it start doing some
[SPEAKER_00]: damage to a couple branches then dilute as
necessary usually 25 to 50 mils of 30
[SPEAKER_00]: percent hydrogen peroxide not the cheap
shit you need the good stuff the 30
[SPEAKER_00]: percent the medical grade the good shit 25
to 30 mils and a five gallon bucket of
[SPEAKER_00]: water wear your protective equipment when
you're mixing this wear goggles when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're handling all of this wear gloves
because that 30 percent hydrogen peroxide
[SPEAKER_00]: will mess your skin up it is very caustic
if it gets in your eye it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the most painful things you will
ever experience so please when you are
[SPEAKER_00]: using the hydrogen peroxide please use at
least the gloves and I recommend some
[SPEAKER_00]: goggles when you're pouring it I
understand a lot of people aren't going to
[SPEAKER_00]: go get goggles just to pour some shit
enter at your own risk Rasta Jeff is
[SPEAKER_00]: making a disclaimer don't fucking sue me
because you're dumb all right enough said
[SPEAKER_00]: there five gallon bucket 25 to 50 mils of
hydrogen peroxide the good shit 30 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: you can go harder if you want but don't
blame me if that fucks up your buds start
[SPEAKER_00]: low and then work your way up if it's not
taking off the mildew add more when it
[SPEAKER_00]: starts bleaching your buds you've gone too
far dilute you'll figure it out only take
[SPEAKER_00]: one or two branches and you'll notice all
right so we've got our five gallon bucket
[SPEAKER_00]: filled with our solution you don't have to
use the hydrogen peroxide but that is what
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend if we're going to do this that
is something I would recommend I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think it will damage your plants I don't
think it will mess anything up I've
[SPEAKER_00]: applied hydrogen peroxide as a foliar
spray before to combat powdery mildew and
[SPEAKER_00]: in my opinion it works very very well it
leaves the gross smelling clean and fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: and the next day you don't even notice it
happened except there's no powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: and the plants are happier and it smells
amazing like ganja in that room so we've
[SPEAKER_00]: got our five gallon bucket we've got our
hydrogen peroxide in there we've got our
[SPEAKER_00]: gloves on maybe some of you are wearing
eye gear probably not we're gonna cut our
[SPEAKER_00]: plant into manageable sections probably 10
to 12 inch sections something like that is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably manageable for most people before
we even start dunking these buds have a
[SPEAKER_00]: place where they are going to hang where
are they gonna go once you dunk these buds
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna dunk them into water you're
gonna swirl them around we're gonna take
[SPEAKER_00]: them out we've got to hang them somewhere
for them to drip dry they're gonna have a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of water in there depending on how
spongy and dense your buds are and how
[SPEAKER_00]: much bud is on that stick there's going to
be quite a bit of water left in there it
[SPEAKER_00]: will come out don't worry don't squeeze it
don't do anything fucking crazy to it let
[SPEAKER_00]: it drip out let it just come out naturally
okay so have that space in mind have it
[SPEAKER_00]: planned have it ready maybe already know
exactly how much space you need to hang
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants before you even get to this
point because I don't want you to have wet
[SPEAKER_00]: buds and a struggle that's when you're
going to cause problems if you don't fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: it up this will go very well but if you
don't have a proper strategy and a place
[SPEAKER_00]: to put the buds before you dunk them shit
will go wrong I promise we can't stack up
[SPEAKER_00]: wet buds they've got to be hung with space
with care so have a place for them to go
[SPEAKER_00]: have the product your solution ready have
your protective equipment on cut the buds
[SPEAKER_00]: into manageable pieces now here's where
we're gonna get crazy you got a five
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon bucket right take your piece of bud
your branch your stock however much
[SPEAKER_00]: product you've got and just submerge it
right into the water I know this sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: brave I know this sounds crazy you just
put months into this product but I have
[SPEAKER_00]: done entire harvests in commercial
facilities this way I've paid guys to
[SPEAKER_00]: spend all day washing buds with hydrogen
peroxide because we couldn't rescue this
[SPEAKER_00]: facility that was coated in powdery mildew
and that was our solution it all got made
[SPEAKER_00]: into extracts it was all tested it was all
safe it all worked I trust this method so
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to dunk our buds directly into
the five gallon bucket with our hydrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: peroxide solution while it's in there
jostle it the word that I want to use is
[SPEAKER_00]: jostle stir the buds around don't get in
there and fucking we're not trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: shake the trichomes off we're trying to
jostle the powdery mildew off we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to disrupt the plant just want to
rinse it just not vigorous but not not
[SPEAKER_00]: lily dipping but you want to get in there
and kind of just in and out and swish it
[SPEAKER_00]: around a little bit just get that just get
some movement gets a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: friction in there just wash that powdery
mildew off then take that plant out and
[SPEAKER_00]: give it a visual assessment look at it do
you see more problems did bug poop come
[SPEAKER_00]: off of it did the spiderweb come off of it
did the bird shit come off did the powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew wash off did you do a good enough
job if not dunk that fucker back in there
[SPEAKER_00]: give it another wiggle another jiggle
another another jostle do what you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: do until it's clean hang it up repeat as
necessary maybe do a portion of the crop
[SPEAKER_00]: at this point maybe just do some of it and
see how you like this method check on
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants check on them in an hour
check on them in two four six every
[SPEAKER_00]: few hours just check on them see what is
happening before you do the whole crop
[SPEAKER_00]: notice do not try to re-moisten and do
this to a dried plant you can't do that
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to be a total failure so take
your wet plant dunk it shake it jostle it
[SPEAKER_00]: around hang it up if you like how that one
came out in a couple of hours do the rest
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plants dunk them all dunk them
jostle them give them a little swish watch
[SPEAKER_00]: the powdery mildew come on up now
eventually that water is going to start
[SPEAKER_00]: looking a little bit funky at your own
discretion dump that shit out start fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: the hydrogen peroxide is not super
expensive you've gotten this far with it
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully it's working for you and it is
cost-effective but feel free to dump that
[SPEAKER_00]: shit out and start fresh let me check my
notes make sure I'm on pace replace the
[SPEAKER_00]: water as necessary you'll start seeing
powdery mildew on the top or you'll start
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing it'll get grimy and gross you'll
know you'll feel you'll just have a
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling that's gross I should change it
change it don't be afraid hang the buds so
[SPEAKER_00]: hang them where they can drip dry I would
hang them somewhere with an ambient
[SPEAKER_00]: environment I know that wherever like just
ambient no you don't need extreme heat
[SPEAKER_00]: extreme cold normal ambient environment
somewhere between 65 and 75 degrees would
[SPEAKER_00]: be cool would be ideal but right now I'm
gonna give you up to 82 ish degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's hotter than shit everywhere
and it's gonna be hard to find a cool
[SPEAKER_00]: space like that so if you get a cool dry
space that would be ideal let them drip
[SPEAKER_00]: dry there's gonna be a lot of water
falling out of these buds onto the floor
[SPEAKER_00]: be prepared for that maybe do it outside
maybe do it in the garage then once
[SPEAKER_00]: they're done dripping and they're no
longer dripping then you can move them to
[SPEAKER_00]: your regular drying space and you can
manage that I understand it's hot as shit
[SPEAKER_00]: right now I'd probably have to have an 80
degree drying space just because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: how it is but we can't always always have
all the perfect shit have a fan in there
[SPEAKER_00]: have fans moving the air so none of the
air is stagnant but don't have fans
[SPEAKER_00]: directly blowing onto the plants speed
drying them so if you can have an
[SPEAKER_00]: oscillating fan that just goes across the
plants occasionally that's okay have air
[SPEAKER_00]: movement in the room but don't blow onto
the plants because that'll cause dryness
[SPEAKER_00]: that we don't want that'll dry one section
fast and the others won't be dry evenly
[SPEAKER_00]: that'll start causing you problems so at
this point basically dry your plants like
[SPEAKER_00]: you normally would proceed with caution
keep an eye on the plants don't let the
[SPEAKER_00]: room get too humid you may need to step up
your humid your dehumidifier or your
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction fan however you're drying and
curing spaces set up don't let it get too
[SPEAKER_00]: humid in there that's something that is
very important at this time have that room
[SPEAKER_00]: dialed in have a way to get rid of the
excess humidity because we did soak these
[SPEAKER_00]: buds in water and then we put them
hopefully let them drip long enough but
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of water in there so a lot
of that water has to come out expect a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of extra days on your dry time but
that is not a problem in my opinion
[SPEAKER_00]: letting cannabis dry longer is a good
thing some of you guys want it to dry
[SPEAKER_00]: super fast it's better when it dries
slower a better thing happens there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: conversion happening there's a conversion
that happens during the drying and cure
[SPEAKER_00]: process that happens better if it goes
more slowly so take your time with the
[SPEAKER_00]: drying and curing process I will work on
an updated drying and curing episode I
[SPEAKER_00]: know I haven't done that updated episode
there's a just an audio only version we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: get a video version of that coming up
those episodes take a lot of focus and a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of work a lot of time to record a lot
of perfection in the editing but we'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: it right we'll get it out for you but at
this point I feel like I have gotten you
[SPEAKER_00]: through bud washing it's not as scary as
it sounds it's not as intimidating as it
[SPEAKER_00]: sounds it's not as nasty as it sounds
you're taking a bucket with some hydrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: peroxide you can use h2o2 if you've got
that available once again be just as
[SPEAKER_00]: careful if not more careful with the h2o2
it's just as caustic it'll burn it'll fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: you up it's dangerous use your personal
protective equipment don't sue me if you
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck up also if you get caught doing
anything illegal involving this plant this
[SPEAKER_00]: culture this scene I will not be held
responsible Rasta Jeff is a fictional
[SPEAKER_00]: character and this is a show for
entertainment purposes but mix up your
[SPEAKER_00]: solution dunk that shit in there give it a
swirl hang it up and don't let it get
[SPEAKER_00]: moldy because it's too wet and don't speed
dry it that is the gist of bud washing
[SPEAKER_00]: think about why you're doing it a lot of
extractors have started bud washing even
[SPEAKER_00]: if there is not a problem in the grow they
find that the grow spaces are dusty where
[SPEAKER_00]: I live this town experience there's a
documentary called the dust bowl this town
[SPEAKER_00]: was part of the dust bowl this town where
I live gets dusty there's desert that way
[SPEAKER_00]: there's desert that way there's a steel
mill that way that produces all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: weird dusty shit so we have to dust here
constantly if you dust the shelves you
[SPEAKER_00]: dust Monday you're probably dusting again
Thursday and if you don't it builds up a
[SPEAKER_00]: funky gunk of dust it is dusty here all
that shit's on our plants as well my table
[SPEAKER_00]: is not very sticky it's kind of sticky
because I take some dabs here the table is
[SPEAKER_00]: not naturally really sticky and it gets
dusty and funky our cannabis plants if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing it right they're sticky as
shit especially outside so you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: get all of that dust from the desert that
we've got all of that weird shit floating
[SPEAKER_00]: around from the wind all of that stuff
from the steel mill all the brake dust if
[SPEAKER_00]: you live by the interstate and you got to
grow by the interstate there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: brake dust in the air all of that shit
will be stuck to your plants we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think about that so that's a very good
logical rational reason to do a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of bud washing and then when you start
rinsing those plants and you see what's
[SPEAKER_00]: left in the water you'll be a little bit
disgusted that you haven't thought about
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it before we're making extracts
we're making food we're smoking these
[SPEAKER_00]: products imagine it would you want to
smoke a bunch of dirt would you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke a nice hit of bird shit you down bro
hey bro I got a big bag of bird turd you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to take a hit off of this that
doesn't sound appealing to me don't be
[SPEAKER_00]: afraid don't be scared to wash your buds
don't be ashamed of it either we put a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of work and a lot of energy into our grow
sometimes you have to have something to
[SPEAKER_00]: show for a lot of you this is your
medicine for the year this is what is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get you by this is what it's
gonna make you not super sick from
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever ails you I don't want to pin you
with some sort of condition but this may
[SPEAKER_00]: be what is saving your life for the next
year let's do what we can to save it let's
[SPEAKER_00]: be proud about it let's be safe let's be
as clean and conscious as about it as we
[SPEAKER_00]: can as well keep in mind prevention is key
but right now at the outdoor season that I
[SPEAKER_00]: saw there was a lot of powdery mildew and
there were not a lot of ways to prevent it
[SPEAKER_00]: because we cannot control the VPD outdoors
you can apply a few things I do like cease
[SPEAKER_00]: I like zero tall I like double nickel
what's the one from maroon bio innovations
[SPEAKER_00]: the they've got a couple maybe it's
Grandivo there's a lot of great products
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can spray that work as a
preventative or a it will help remove the
[SPEAKER_00]: pen eradicator of the powdery mildew but I
understand sometimes she gets away from
[SPEAKER_00]: you so if you're fighting the powdery
mildew now you can spray with cease you
[SPEAKER_00]: could spray with double nickel and then
when it comes time to harvest do that dunk
[SPEAKER_00]: in either zero tall or hydrogen peroxide
also heavy defoliation will help you with
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew all right ladies gentlemen
boys girls pamps hose friends foes smokers
[SPEAKER_00]: growers clone cutters pollen chukers
spinners guys that stand there chompers
[SPEAKER_00]: and tapers I want to thank each and every
one of you for hanging out listening to
[SPEAKER_00]: another episode of the group of the grow
from your heart podcast I forgot the name
[SPEAKER_00]: of my own show for a moment there this was
a good time I had a great time I hope you
[SPEAKER_00]: had as much fun as I did I hope I helped
you out I hope I rescued your outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest I really hope you don't have a
powdery mildew problem but if you do maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll get you through it we'll get through
it together again don't be ashamed don't
[SPEAKER_00]: be embarrassed shit happens especially
outdoors you guys that is going to happen
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's indoors we've got to correct some
issues that's a whole nother conversation
[SPEAKER_00]: a whole nother podcast but don't ever be
ashamed don't be fearful don't be scared
[SPEAKER_00]: that you had or have a problem in your
grow that's how we learn the most if they
[SPEAKER_00]: went perfect every time just be perfect
every time and when a problem came up you
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't know what to do with it guess
what now we know what to do with powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew all right I've been rambling for a
long time thanks again for hanging out you
