this podcast off by talking about what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Mochi
Gelato Ambrosia from Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label says this product contains 68.7%
THC and 81.7% total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the Mochi Gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buzz is just right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the amount of gigantic diamonds to
Terp Sauce in this 4 gram jar was perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really approve of this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at
Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apothecary Farms and many of my other
favorite concentrate companies will be at
[SPEAKER_00]: the Dude Grows Concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Celebration on 713 at Cultivated Synergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dude Grows crew, myself, Apothecary
Farms and many other popular concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: companies from Colorado will be at the 710
Concentration Celebration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scotty and the crew have planned a great
educational experience.

[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
I said that I was going to read some
[SPEAKER_00]: iTunes customer reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's pull up iTunes and jump right into
that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to leave an iTunes
customer rating and review, it is really
[SPEAKER_00]: easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of you are listening on an Apple
device.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got an iPhone or an iPad or
possibly an Apple computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really easy to leave a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are using an iPhone or an iPad,
all you have to do is open the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: application in that device, then find the
podcast you want to leave a review for.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we want to leave a review
for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So simply click on the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it will show you the episodes that
are saved in your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it will show available episodes then
previously played.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you will see ratings and reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will give you the option to tap and
rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can give me as many stars as you feel
I deserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then right below that, it will show write
a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tap on that and it will give you the
option to write a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would appreciate it if you leave a
review of the podcast on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most current podcast reviews go a lot
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our first review was left on May 8th.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was left by a person who calls
themselves Blackbird76.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave us a five-star rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said best educational podcast out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the review goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're at all interested in growing,
this is the go-to podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff drops a ton of great knowledge
while keeping it fun and easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I start to feel lost or a little
overwhelmed, I smoke a bowl, check the
[SPEAKER_00]: catalog and Rasta Jeff will help with my
question or push my brain in the right
[SPEAKER_00]: direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Blackbird, thank you for the great
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love hearing that my show is your go-to
when you need grow information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like that you say if you're at all
interested in growing to check out the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do try to keep it, like I've said plenty
of times, I like to keep the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: listenable for brand new growers and I
like to go in depth for people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: really experienced.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to make it for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you see the knowledge and I'm
glad you think it's easy to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really try to break it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not like school, but I really like
learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So making things easy to understand,
teaching things in several different
[SPEAKER_00]: creative ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that you see me trying to do that
and I'm glad the show is working for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad that sometimes when you do
feel lost or overwhelmed, which is a good
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, that means you're learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means you're thinking beyond your
bubble and you need to expand a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you ever do feel lost and
overwhelmed, I'm glad that you smoke a
[SPEAKER_00]: bowl and check the catalog of podcasts and
then I am able to help you get your brain
[SPEAKER_00]: in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you ended the review by saying thank
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Blackbird, thank you for listening and
thanks for the great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to the next iTunes customer
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was left on May 11th.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was left by a person who calls
themselves Kush is my cologne.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline of their review says love the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave us another five star review.
[SPEAKER_00]: The iTunes customer review goes a lot like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the best educational and
entertaining cannabis podcast shows to
[SPEAKER_00]: date.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, thanks for not becoming just another
expensive genetics company.
[SPEAKER_00]: One love and then they sign it with a
bunch of looks like smoke or cloud
[SPEAKER_00]: blowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like they're puffing smoke emojis
and then a peace sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big old puffs of clouds right back at you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of smoke blown right in your
direction and then another peace sign
[SPEAKER_00]: right back at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says one of the best educational and
entertaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are great words to see in a
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I am hitting my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Entertaining and educational.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep you listening and teach you some
stuff at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he says thanks for not becoming
just another expensive genetics company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of passion for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want everybody to have access to high
quality seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I make sure that my seeds are
affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with my distributors and my vendors
to make sure that those seeds stay at an
[SPEAKER_00]: affordable price point so that everybody
has access to quality seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's unfair that some people can't
get quality medicine because they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have a bunch of money to get some hyped up
seeds that they've seen in a magazine that
[SPEAKER_00]: have been hyped up for way too long and
now they're way overpriced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people just need good medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need all that advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need all the hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I make sure that that is available.
[SPEAKER_00]: To everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for noticing that I'm not just
another expensive seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, thank you for the great
review and for the five star rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a couple of more reviews on the
screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was left on May 14th.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was left by somebody who calls
themselves DaddyO45.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline says Rasta Jeff kicks butt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kick butt too for leaving a great
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: The review goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so cool that General Rasta Jeff,
leader of the Airy Army, is a returning
[SPEAKER_00]: host on the panel of the Embracing
Organics show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite often I do go on the Embracing
Organics live show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Embracing Organics is another cannabis
based podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show is live on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is hosted by my friend Dirtman Dan.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got guys like Tenasi Gardens on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stabby McStaberson is on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medfit is on there quite frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zen Gardens is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bear Grown comes and joins us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes Canuck Growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dirt is on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe 710 Canuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, my Canadian friend comes and jumps
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a great podcast about growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to join them when I can on
Thursdays.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get into deep growing conversations and
we also kind of go into some really silly
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're into cannabis podcasts,
I think you would enjoy the Embracing
[SPEAKER_00]: Organics show live on YouTube on
Thursdays.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also do leave it up so you can catch
that at any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But catch the live show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is Thursdays at seven o'clock Mountain
Time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what time that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to be there about seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So join us for that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The review does go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I think it would be hella cool if
you, General Rasta Jeff, would start a
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% organic, no-till home grow,
but with your style of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm not really a no-till grower and
I'm kind of not into the organic idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of do bottles and salts and
powdered nutrients and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not really my style to go no-till
or 100% organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's keep going just to see where
this review goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, hell make a video podcast grow
lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we could all grow and learn along
with you, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said a second ago, I don't
really do the 100% organic, no-till type
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would have to, I would have to
change everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have to start some no-till soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have to rethink my whole process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of have my grow spaces
dedicated to breeding projects for at
[SPEAKER_00]: least the next six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a breeder, I do make kind of a
schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a Colorado grower, I am very limited to
space on my personal grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are mostly dedicated to breeding
and testing the breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do come across more commercial space
and we do do some sort of a no-till thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will think about making some lessons and
videos to go with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now I can't do a no-till thing
because that is not even my style.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would have to get Sean to come in and
help us out with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have to call in somebody that is more
experienced in that, maybe get Frosty to
[SPEAKER_00]: come help out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is not my area of expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe Jesse could guide us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we can get some somebody to help us
with some more no-till stuff in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate the enthusiasm,
but I don't want to steer you wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not my wheelhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not the no-till guy and I'm not
afraid to admit that that is not my area
[SPEAKER_00]: of expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to set up a commercial
facility, if you want to set up drip lines
[SPEAKER_00]: and run stuff like Veg Bloom or New
Millennium or something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can really steer you the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this no-till stuff, that is not my
area of expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I couldn't even do the episodes that
you're asking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going because there is more of
this review.
[SPEAKER_00]: It continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, where am I?
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost my place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, thank you for all that you have
and will do for the whole 420 community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he signs the message with,
your iry army grunt, Richard 420 Gramps
[SPEAKER_00]: Memel 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I know who you are, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all of the support and thank
you for the great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate all of the kind input and
I do appreciate you finishing that up with
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, thanks for what I do for the whole
420 community.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does mean a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for the great review and thanks
for the kind words.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have more reviews on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was left on May 18th by a person who
calls themselves PJAM7913.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline says, I love this Rasta man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up, I love you too, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: They left a five star rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: The review says, very amazing podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff has some of the best info out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I'm glad my info is helping you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you are applying it to your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, I love this show and
everything about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: From PJAM.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't get much better than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a great headline.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a stellar review and you've got
a name that I can pronounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the last review for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was left on May 18th by a person
who calls themselves itty bitty 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline says, this is the podcast you
have been looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it is followed by two thumbs up
emojis, a bunch of flames and a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like they gave us five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always like a nice five star review.
[SPEAKER_00]: The review goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast has more knowledge than
public school has to offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you feel that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff himself, just to hear him ramble,
you should listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a weird sentence, but I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff himself, just to hear him ramble,
you should listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like some sort of programming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he has white mic to come in and give
you a real look at the judicial side of
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do like to bring my white mic in to
talk about the legal side, the political
[SPEAKER_00]: side, the activism side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of focus on the grow and that sort
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I bring Mike in for a different view.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I like to bring, like I mentioned
earlier, Jesse comes in and talks about
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor and no till growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Sean comes and talks about organic
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bring in a lot of friends to talk about
a lot of great stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you noticed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the review goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, if you have a question,
Jeff will take his time and help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do my best to answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I answer every question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a giant stack of emails filled with
questions and I've got an email inbox that
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not even been able to print all of
those questions, but I do my best to get
[SPEAKER_00]: to every single one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does take some time, but I do my best
to answer all of the questions that come
[SPEAKER_00]: through the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do my best to answer all of the social
media questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I go on Instagram live every Monday
at seven 10 mountain time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talk about growing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I answer questions from the people who are
watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I answer random on the fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about cannabis news.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I take a few dabs and just
ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do try to answer as many questions as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The review goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says most people won't even help their
families.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, that is true today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, if you are looking for
anything cannabis related industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have found it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to give a big thanks to my new
friend, itty bitty 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the five star rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, thank you for the great
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, that wraps up the
rating and review portion of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a big thanks and a big
