[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I do include a link in the
show notes and in the video description to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it nice and easy for all of my
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to ramble too much here at
the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into the main topic of this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about King Solomon and
selecting male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a message from our friend Darcy and
it goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, let me start with
how much I love your work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The podcast has kept me company for years
and I have learned a lot from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love knowing that people are learning
from me and I love knowing that the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast keeps you company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listen to a lot of podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listen when I'm driving, when I'm
working, when I just need some
[SPEAKER_00]: entertainment and it is like hanging out
with some of your best friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to pick and choose who you listen
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's better than having your
friends around because you can just press
[SPEAKER_00]: pause, mute, next, skip whenever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hear good entertaining shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad and I'm excited and grateful
that you are choosing me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for choosing me to be in your
ear rambling at you all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I'm glad you're learning from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the goal here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I can get rambly quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I am also a huge fan of your
breeding work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I was also lucky enough to score
some lemon Jeffrey a while back and they
[SPEAKER_00]: were beautiful plants that grew the most
amazing daytime weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super energetic, social, and she was a
beauty.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I now want to start making some
seeds of my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that is the natural progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people start growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get good at growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they realize I want to breed and see
what I can create.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very natural progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of how we ended up where I am
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says after after years of hearing you
speak about King Solomon, I thought your
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics might be a good place to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could not get any arise seeds in my
area, but I was able to score some dark
[SPEAKER_00]: hollow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will still be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be a great project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people are breeding with the rise
that you will set yourself apart by
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding with the dark hollow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good start.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says my plan is to search this pack for
a breeding male, then hit that pollen to
[SPEAKER_00]: some proven females.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really good strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of things I want to
touch on before I get too much further.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of breeders in this industry and
this game in this community do not like it
[SPEAKER_00]: when new growers or growers or breeders
work with their stuff for breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are territorial.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are possessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to have some control over their
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have acquired seeds or plants of
mine, if you paid for them, if you traded
[SPEAKER_00]: for them, if you didn't steal them,
even if you did steal them, I can't stop
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have permission, rights, my blessings
to breed with the seeds that I have made.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not invent cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't pull seeds out of the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't fart out some seeds and breed
with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used seeds and plants that were bred by
other breeders before me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I find no problem in breeding with my
stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find a male or a female in a pack
of my seeds that you want to work with,
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly encourage and promote you to do
the breeding work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I can ask for is credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you sell those seeds, if you post them
anywhere, if the pictures of those buds
[SPEAKER_00]: get any recognition, when you do list to
the cross, give me some credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that that was a dark hollow male from
I read genetics that was used for the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen donor or put that it was a
strawberry starburst or a orange gas or a
[SPEAKER_00]: sun kissed female, whatever you use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give me credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all that I really want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a few seeds would be cool if you
want to send me beans, that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: polite.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I don't have time or space to run
them right now anyway, so that wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_00]: too much of a setback if I didn't get that
pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did send them, I would find time to
run them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I do run them, I would send you a
clone of the keeper is usually how that
[SPEAKER_00]: works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I wanted to make sure that people
do know, realize and understand you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: full permission to breed with the seeds
you've acquired from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you pay for those, they're yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like if you bought a Ferrari,
and the car dealer tried to tell you now
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't drive this car like an asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the point?
[SPEAKER_00]: You bought a Ferrari, you want to drive
like an asshole, go have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel the same about my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I said there was a couple of things I
wanted to unpack in that statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more thing I want to talk about you
have got a pack of dark hollow seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you were looking for a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I always say is, when we get
seeds, when you get a seed pack,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're probably going to get you've
probably got a 10 pack, you're probably
[SPEAKER_00]: going to find approximately five males,
five females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I want to mention is,
when it comes to breeding, I never use the
[SPEAKER_00]: first male plant of the bunch that shows
me it's a boy for my breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: That first plant to display male traits,
in my opinion, is going to be too much
[SPEAKER_00]: male for the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me try to explain what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: That first dude to show you that he's a
boy is just too much testosterone.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with that plant,
but I wouldn't use him for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to put too much of himself into
the offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times my goal when I'm breeding
is to mix or blend the male and the female
[SPEAKER_00]: and have traits of both parent plants show
in the offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we use a male plant that is too
dominant, we're just going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: reproducing that male plant in all of the
progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cross that male plant to
strawberry, to orange, to bubblegum,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to wash out the orange and
the strawberry and the bubblegum and just
[SPEAKER_00]: recreate more of that male plant because
he's got too much of his genetics into the
[SPEAKER_00]: mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times I completely skip the
first and second male to start showing me
[SPEAKER_00]: that they are male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes those are really tall,
really stretchy, really fibrous plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we don't want to breed tall,
stretchy, fibrous offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make vigorous potent offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get rid of those tall, stretchy dudes
that are just going to make tall,
[SPEAKER_00]: stretchy offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not trying to make hemp here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would get rid of the first,
maybe even the second dude to show me that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually work with that third or fourth
male out of a group of five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I would rather have more seeds
to choose from, but if you've got quality
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, you will find a keeper in that 10
pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will find a boy worth working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I think I've unpacked the two things I
wanted to talk about in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move forward and read more of this
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does go on to say, I've always been a
fan of the strain-specific episodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was wondering if you would consider
doing one on King Solomon to help me find
[SPEAKER_00]: a boy with similar traits to help me
understand what makes him special compared
[SPEAKER_00]: to other male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that you appreciate these
strain-specific episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I feel like those are bragging
or tooting my own horn or advertising or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, but I love that you guys
appreciate those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this episode, what I'm going to try
to do is kind of a mashup.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about his traits,
what he is, why I selected him,
[SPEAKER_00]: why he works so well for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that same process, we're going to talk
about everybody else selecting a male
[SPEAKER_00]: plant for a breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have to keep in mind here is we've
got different goals or possibly different
[SPEAKER_00]: goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your total outcome goal here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you want to cross the dark hollow
with a few proven females.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll see what that does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your ultimate goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal is to make seeds for commercial
production and for retail sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: My seeds have to work in a variety of grow
spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to germinate well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to give us what we're
expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got different goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also got a different male plant to
work with here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all about the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that in mind that we've got different
goals and different starting ingredients,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm sure that you can follow along.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's jump right into it and talk about
what is King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: King Solomon is a specially selected male
plant from a batch of Arise F1 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the heck does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a golden goat female and a
daybreaker male, and I pollinated the
[SPEAKER_00]: golden goat female that made Arise F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: From that batch of Arise F1 seeds,
I found a male that stood out to me in
[SPEAKER_00]: many ways for many reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: That male has been named King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one plant that is a dude with his
own specific name.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how much I like him.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how much I rely on him.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how successful he has been.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're curious about the name,
that is some Torah biblical stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Research King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: King Solomon was a king.
[SPEAKER_00]: He could have had anything he wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: His weaknesses was that he loved the
ladies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I named my male plant Solomon because
he has pollinated a lot of ladies.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's doing work, spreading his
generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So King Solomon is an Arise F1 male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just an Arise male selected from a batch
of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the way he grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew he was going to stick around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave him his own name.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call him Saul.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call him Sully.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets a lot of names around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets a lot of love.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is King Solomon, an F1 Arise male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about why I chose that
male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did I choose him?
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew out a bunch of seeds and I ran a
bunch of male plants side by side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the one that stood out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked the vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant has got hyper vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: He veges super quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: He flowers super quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people tell me that they have to
adjust their scheduling differently
[SPEAKER_00]: because they are growing Arise crosses in
their grow and the plants veg so quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: they can cut off a week or two weeks of
veg time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is how quickly Arise grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: That trait from that male plant that
passes on to most of his offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's got great vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one of the main traits that I like
about him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is also known for having good
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of his progeny, the offspring he
makes, are resistant to pathogens,
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew, mold, and also bugs like
spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see a lot of these plants don't get as
badly affected by bugs as many other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also really like the shape and the
structure of King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a good shape and a good structure
and that translates into the plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: come from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: His progeny have a good shape and a good
structure and hyper vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is really important for a male
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about one of the most
obvious and most important traits that
[SPEAKER_00]: come from King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solomon is known for passing on extremely
high potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything Solomon touches turns to gold
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes out vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got good structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows quite quickly and it is super
potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I call King Solomon the fixer or
the corrector plant because I'll have a
[SPEAKER_00]: female plant that I really like the way
that it grows but it's just missing
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's not putting out enough harvest
weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's not putting out enough potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it doesn't grow quickly enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will pollinate it with King Solomon
and that seems to improve and put other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants into turbo charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever I pollinate it with, the
offspring is the female plant plus turbo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the female plant plus more
trichomes, more potency, and more vigor,
[SPEAKER_00]: and more harvest weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a big part of why Solomon is a
great male.
[SPEAKER_00]: He adds resistance, he adds vigor,
he adds potency, and he doesn't disrupt
[SPEAKER_00]: the flavor too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have a female plant that's got a
great flavor, I know that Saul is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: go in there and fix the structure,
the potency, and he's going to leave that
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor that the females got so I can find
that good balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I like to cross it to,
you've seen it cross to a strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, not a strawberry but a strawberry
flavored plant, an orange flavored plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: a blueberry flavored plant because I like
to keep those turps and those flavors in
[SPEAKER_00]: there but I want to add that vigor,
that potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really coming from King
Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that potency is a main factor that
everybody relies on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love that potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also love that it is a fixer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, if there's a plant that's
just not performing the way that I need it
[SPEAKER_00]: to, pollinate it with King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds that come from that will be that
original female plus turbo plus bonus plus
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel plus super charge because we hit it
with King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives it that potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it doesn't ruin the flavor but it
gives it, it just turbo charges the
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of adds a little gas to it,
a little funk to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who doesn't love a little gas,
a little funk added to almost any strain
[SPEAKER_00]: you're smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a big part of why we chose
Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me take a look at these notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not ruin the buzz and it doesn't
overpower the crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lets the female shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I find important.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're trying to make a cross,
I like to see the male traits and the
[SPEAKER_00]: female traits in the cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want that potency, the vigor,
the aggression from Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I still want those strawberry
turps in that plant structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to see both of them in the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Arise tends to not over dominate in
the crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is basically why I have chosen
King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: He adds vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: He adds aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: He adds potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: He adds resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: He fixes things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a plant that is not living
up to par, that is doing a lot of great
[SPEAKER_00]: things but it's missing something,
King Solomon likely will add what it is
[SPEAKER_00]: missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I've chosen to breed almost
everything in my garden gets pollinated by
[SPEAKER_00]: King Solomon and then we see what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about your breeding
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your project is different than mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts off different because you've got
a different male.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't make the same thing because you
don't have the same male as me,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already making Arise crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are already making Arise
crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to make some dark hollow
crosses, which will be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've got to, I want to help you
select your male and give you some ideas
[SPEAKER_00]: of how to select that dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important part of any breeding
project is knowing a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want to create?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you lacking?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is not in your garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got a female plant that you
want to fix.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that female plant not giving you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you do this cross, before you chuck
any pollen, write down the male plants
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to use, the male plant you
are going to use, and the female plants
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: List the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then make kind of a prediction,
a hypothesis, a theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are these crosses going to be like
once you make them?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cross this dark hollow male to
female number one, what is your predicted
[SPEAKER_00]: goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: What will the aromas and flavors be like?
[SPEAKER_00]: How will it grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: What phenotypes are you looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did you do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: List that for every cross you're about to
make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then make the cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the funnest part is growing out those
seeds to see what you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way to find out what your male
plant is doing to the crosses is by
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinating several females and then
growing those out and looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: differences in those crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you cross it to strawberry,
does it still taste like strawberry or
[SPEAKER_00]: does it taste like strawberry or did we
wash that out?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you cross it to blueberry,
does it taste like blueberry or did we
[SPEAKER_00]: wash that out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it get the vigor of the male plant,
the turps of the female?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out what it is contributing to the
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just cross it to one plant,
you're only going to see one set of
[SPEAKER_00]: traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to identify what the male is
doing unless it's really obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put it to several females,
we can really see what the effects are on
[SPEAKER_00]: all of those different female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would start off by looking for a
plant with the structure you are looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you want your future plants to be
shaped?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like kind of taller plants because I
like those sativa dominant plants with big
[SPEAKER_00]: colas because I like a lot of herb and I
like a really head ripping head buzz and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think sativa dominant tall skinny plants
give me that head buzz I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would look for tall skinny plants
with long skinny leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's not what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the leaf shape and plant structure
that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that bigger whiter leaves are
usually more indica dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skinnier leaves are going to be more
sativa dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the leaf shape and plant structure
that suits your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then one thing to think about is aroma and
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does this plant smell like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a stem rub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smell your fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it smell like vomit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it smell like trash can?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it smell like fruit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it smell like berries?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like a male plant that smells
like vomit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the male plant smells acrid and gross,
that's probably going to translate into
[SPEAKER_00]: good stuff in the offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind this is one ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't the total equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to add that dirty stinky
socks, gasoline, and bar trash can to
[SPEAKER_00]: other things and see how they mix
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really like a male that's got a nasty
gross acrid putrid vomit bar trash can
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now another really important thing to
think about, in my opinion, is flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want plants to take a long time to
flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, longer flowering plants get
better potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like that longer flowering plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it can do something more with
the potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buzz is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you need a rush plant that gets out
of there in eight weeks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would find a male that finishes the
flowers in eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need a plant that finishes sooner,
I would find a faster flowering male.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way to do that is to let the
males flower out in the test room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me talk about that for a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might not even pollinate with the first
run of growing this male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might grow out five male plants and
finish them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them go nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them go 10 weeks and see what they do
at week 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may watch one plant bulk up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may stop making pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may keep making pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are things to look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that plant act at a few weeks
into flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven, eight, nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it do weird shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it give you nutrient issues?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it start doing, does it explode with
growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it stop putting out trichomes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it start putting out trichomes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow that male plant out as long as you
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next time you run it is when you
want to collect the pollen and do the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't collect pollen if you've got
multiple dudes around because who knows,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to be a Maury situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't know who the baby daddy is if you
got multiple dudes around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grow those dudes out, flower them,
see what they do, see how they perform.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they handle nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they handle light?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lay it in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't even know what a
male plant is going to look like at week
[SPEAKER_00]: 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your boys to week nine, week 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick one from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then do the pollination in the next run.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then that is the main part.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to do pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollinate the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then finish those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that is when we really get to do the
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germinate those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they germinate?
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't germinate, I wouldn't really
continue too far making more of those
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after pollination is the fun part.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to wait for the seeds to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you get to harvest them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull the seeds out of each plant that you
pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure they're labeled so you know what
you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then grow as many as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your legalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your limitations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would grow at least 10 of each one
and take a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compare similarities and differences
between each cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can see what that male plant is
doing to the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't like what he did,
don't be afraid to throw those seeds away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flush them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let people know that that wasn't a
winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't sell them as winner seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll mess up your reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But try again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to try again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have thrown away a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy to throw seeds away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feed them to the birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use them as compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put out shitty seeds to the
community, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the main way to find out what you've
done, the only way really to find out what
[SPEAKER_00]: you've done is to grow those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really fun, in my opinion,
growing a male plant, finding a male,
[SPEAKER_00]: then pollinating some multiple female
plants, then growing those and seeing the
[SPEAKER_00]: similarities and the differences in all of
those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've grown anything of mine that's
been crossed to a rise, if you've grown
[SPEAKER_00]: more than one or two of those crosses,
you can see what Solomon is doing and what
[SPEAKER_00]: the females are doing to that cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a lot of growing and breeding,
it will become very obvious to you what
[SPEAKER_00]: the male plant is doing and what the
female is doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start to identify that very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like learning your children.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can say, oh, you got that from your
father or you got that from your mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it becomes very natural, very obvious,
very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is called developing an eye
for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took me a long time to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I can just look at plants and I
go, man, I need to pollinate that girl
[SPEAKER_00]: with Solomon and it will make this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 90% of the time, my predictions
in my head come out exactly how I expected
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: foes, smokers, growers, clone cutters,
pollen, chukers, my friend Darcy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for listening to this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: My throat is burning out.
[SPEAKER_00]: My voice is going to be completely gone
here pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is time for me to wrap up this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I answered your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I choose my mail based on the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I check for a certain criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is it shaped?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is it smell?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it give me enough pollen to make
seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long is that pollen window?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it make trichomes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it make colors?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it smell?
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ Short smokes his male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: He dries out the buds and smokes the
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ Short does that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's something you will do.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if that male plant gives you a buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once you've selected your male plant
that you find appropriate, pollinate your
[SPEAKER_00]: female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then pollinate multiple females is my
advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then grow out as many of those as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compare notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what that male is delivering to the
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that male is doing what you want it to
do, pollinate a bunch more plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continue with filial generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not doing what you want,
get more seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find another dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ever be afraid to scrap a breeding
project or go backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that's how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't always make the right selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is always about selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, that's all I've got for you for
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like my voice is about to be
completely gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll check in with you in a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a giant shout out to my
buddy Billy Bong Smokin'.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mom a hug for me.
See you next time.
