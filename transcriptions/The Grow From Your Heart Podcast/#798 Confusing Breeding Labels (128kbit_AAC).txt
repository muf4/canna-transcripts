[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 798 of the grow from your
heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a fun show lined up for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, we're going to give away
free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've teamed up with our friends at
seedsherenow.com to give away free
[SPEAKER_00]: iRegenetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more about those free seeds
later in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to remind you once again that
team iRegenetics will be at the Dude Grows
[SPEAKER_00]: Cup June 3rd, just outside of Fort
Collins, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do invite you to join us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come grab some beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come join the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come give me a fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come say hi at the Dude Grows Cup June
3rd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out dgccup.com for all of the info
to that event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I want to remind you about the sale
at ireadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: The $4.20 sale is live.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is still going through the rest of this
month at ireadirect.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some new shit, there's some fresh
shit, and there are definitely some
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you check out ireadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we jump into the cannabis part of
this podcast, I do want to give a big
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to my friend Natalie Rise and
Rise Nation and everybody in Natalie
[SPEAKER_00]: Rise's band.
[SPEAKER_00]: The past weekend, I got to see Natalie
Rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to see three concerts and also a VIP
private party where I was treated like a
[SPEAKER_00]: rock star, where I was treated like
family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Natalie Rise and the
entire Rise Nation, the Rise crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you are not already listening
to or following Natalie Rise, I highly
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend you put some of that into your
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put some of that energy into your music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check out Natalie Rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wanted to make sure to give them all
a great big shout out and a big fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love, much respect to Rise Nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now let's jump into the
cannabis related part of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a message here in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from my friend Richard and
it goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Hello Rasta Jeff, I love the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, you have taught this old
guerrilla grower so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: That goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I do have a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can I access the descriptions of your
strains on ireadirect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your contributions to make
the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You give me hope for humanity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, that is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, thank you for the compliments on the
hope for the humanity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's awesome to know that I've taught
an old guerrilla grower a lot of tricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for learning and listening and
watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question here is How can I access the
descriptions to your strains which are
[SPEAKER_00]: available on ireadirect?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to ireadirect.com to buy seeds,
you'll notice there are not a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are not a lot of descriptions there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot put those photos and descriptions
on the sales page that accepts a credit
[SPEAKER_00]: card.
[SPEAKER_00]: The credit card processors do not like too
many details there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just want it to say a strain name and
some seeds and if it's reg or femme and a
[SPEAKER_00]: price is basically all the info they want
up there on the page.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ireadgenetics.com is my main website where
everything is hosted.
[SPEAKER_00]: The discord is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The podcast is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Links to all of the strain descriptions
are there on that website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go to ireadgenetics.com,
click on genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll take you to regular or feminized and
you can go and read a lot of details about
[SPEAKER_00]: the strains there on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is of course a forever evolving work
in progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some strains have not been updated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have been heavily updated.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of details there on
ireadgenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great option is to join the
discord and you can find a discord link on
[SPEAKER_00]: ireadgenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, hey, web guy, if you're
listening to this, we may need to update
[SPEAKER_00]: the link on discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if that link works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may have expired.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may need to fix that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He watches the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may be a good way to get him a
message and if not, it will remind me when
[SPEAKER_00]: I do some editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to cut that out,
but there is a discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to ireadgenetics.com,
there will be a link to the discord
[SPEAKER_00]: server.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that discord server, there are a lot of
photos of the plants being grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the left tab, if you scroll down,
there will be a tab for every strain that
[SPEAKER_00]: I have put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll start with the rise and it goes all
the way down to whatever the last
[SPEAKER_00]: alphabetical one is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of strains listed there on
the discord server.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are updated by people growing those
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not just done by me, by the web
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an open source, a community
sourced platform where everybody growing
[SPEAKER_00]: that strain is free to go and post their
reviews, their pictures, their
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can ask questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can tell you details.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want more info, my first
recommendation is to check out www
[SPEAKER_00]: .ireadgenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after that, I would recommend
checking out the discord server where you
[SPEAKER_00]: can get a lot of extra information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, since we're talking about it,
if you go to ireadgenetics.com and you
[SPEAKER_00]: notice that one of the strains listed in
the strain section does not have a high
[SPEAKER_00]: quality photo, if you happen to have a
high quality photo of that strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: send me that picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also make sure to label it so I know which
strain that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also send me your social media so I can
follow you, stalk you and give you shout
[SPEAKER_00]: outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then most importantly, send me your
address so that I can send you the gift of
[SPEAKER_00]: free seeds for trading me that picture for
my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always great to have high quality
photos up there for advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me your favorite photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do use it, I will send you a pack of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I use it on the website, I may just
repost it to social media and give you
[SPEAKER_00]: credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still may send you seeds, but no promise
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it goes on the website, you'll get a
free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about the descriptions on
ireadgenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those descriptions will be heavily
detailed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those will not be as super
detailed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those are still evolving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still learning about some of these
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, some of them I posted a long time
ago and forgot to add descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you need a description, if there's
something I've forgotten, also go ahead
[SPEAKER_00]: and send me a heads up and I will do my
best to update those strain descriptions
[SPEAKER_00]: on ireadgenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message came from my friend Richard,
and this did come from the grow help tab
[SPEAKER_00]: on ireadgenetics.com, which means guess
what, Richard?
[SPEAKER_00]: You win a free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: On ireadgenetics.com on the top,
there's a bunch of tabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those tabs does say grow help or
grow questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you click on there and send me a grow
question to the podcast, if I read that
[SPEAKER_00]: question here on the show, you win free
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that free seed giveaway is sponsored
by seedsherenow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the team at seedsherenow
.com for sponsoring a seed giveaway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my friend Richard, please do send me
your address.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know where to send a free pack of
ireadgenetics seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep the podcast moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have plenty of great questions here
in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one also came from the grow help
submission tab on ireadgenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: The name they want to be called is Nostos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I said that properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a general grow question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Dear Rasta Jeff, first and
foremost, I'd like to take a quick second
[SPEAKER_00]: to thank you for you and the wonderful
irea army for representing the best of
[SPEAKER_00]: what this community has to offer,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being a part of the irea
army.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are a big part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just sending me this letter means you are
definitely an irea army.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say in our current 2023
clown world filled with inflated egos and
[SPEAKER_00]: cash hungry snakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful to know it is beautiful to
know that there are still folks out there
[SPEAKER_00]: who are doing the good work and humbling
themselves daily for the benefit of
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I try to make the best seeds I can
and keep them affordable and grow from my
[SPEAKER_00]: heart and breathe with love.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for noticing exactly that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there are a lot of snakes and a lot
of clowns out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just do my best to avoid them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stay neutral.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stay peaceful and I stay out of all the
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep my head down and keep working on my
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for noticing that part,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a question it says now my grow
question with a bit of context.
[SPEAKER_00]: That always helps a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says let's say hypothetically,
that someone was fortunate enough
[SPEAKER_00]: fortunate enough to snag a pack of the
cream which was cookies and cream to arise
[SPEAKER_00]: a great strain, which has been worked into
big mountain fudge cake and we'll continue
[SPEAKER_00]: that project going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, it says it says what if I were to
find an incredible female phenotype from
[SPEAKER_00]: this F1 batch?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that was an F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cream I made was an F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if I find an incredible phenotype
from this F1 that has a strong pungent
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma flavor of fresh ginger with the
effects that has one laying on the floor
[SPEAKER_00]: due to intense OG like stoned that comes
on like a tidal wave, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: That what if hypothetically sign me up,
bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would hypothetically take two of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's turn it into dabs and see how melted
into the floor we can possibly get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the message goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says let's hypothetically imagine that
this pheno produced less than a half a
[SPEAKER_00]: dozen seeds, which he labeled S1 with no
noticeable issue issues of intersex or
[SPEAKER_00]: anthers during late flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this person has grown the cream and
they have produced half a dozen seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when it says with no noticeable issues
of intersex or anthers during late flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming right now that those plants
that the seeds came from were not showing
[SPEAKER_00]: any noticeable issues of intersex or
anthers during late flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we've grown the seeds to
find out what those do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until the next sentence.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the next sentence, we do that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a cream plant that did not show
any problems, but it did produce half a
[SPEAKER_00]: dozen seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this person labeled those seeds S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are those S1?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they F1?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they R1?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or would we label those bag seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I don't know the pollen donor,
those seeds in my mind, in my world as a
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder, as somebody who puts seeds out,
those become bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only know one parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only know one part of the equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, I would not be
comfortable calling it an S1 because I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know what pollinated that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was a self-pollination, then
possibly, but we don't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't reverse anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no way to confirm that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an F1, or it could be an F1 if
something else pollinated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what else is in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know where the pollen could have
came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely could be bag seed is what I
would label this so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would label it the cream bag seed is
what it would say on my bag if I had it
[SPEAKER_00]: with a date on it also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's go into the next sentence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said, Now fast forward to the self
seeds being grown out.
[SPEAKER_00]: These S1s, which I'm not sure they're S1s
honestly, bro, these bag seeds happen to
[SPEAKER_00]: carry the ginger flavor of the aroma with
a nice body stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got some winners out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I always say grow those bag
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, you never know what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it looks like we've got
winners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we move on to the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If these S1 seeds, which we're still kind
of skeptical on that, if these S1 seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: were hypothetically to produce their own
set of self seeds, would these be
[SPEAKER_00]: classified as cream S2 or cream S1F2?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I understand the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since we don't know what pollinated
that cream plant, it's hard to put proper
[SPEAKER_00]: labeling onto these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to call it bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's what this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got like a bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see what the did you self it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see growing those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If these seeds were hypothetically to
produce their own seeds, you could call
[SPEAKER_00]: those self seeds if you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those would be an S2 more than an S1F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be an S2.
[SPEAKER_00]: S is the indication for self.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure how I would label these
because I probably wouldn't continue with
[SPEAKER_00]: the bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If if a plant is making seeds on its own,
I probably wouldn't continue that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not good for a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not good for a production grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something I would have gotten rid
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably the second time I realized it
made seeds, it would disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if I would have gotten
this far with the seeds as you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we can talk a little bit about the
labeling and how this would have been
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say that that cookies that that
cream plant was given pollen that we know
[SPEAKER_00]: it was given pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was given pollen by a regular plant,
a regular male plant, that would make it
[SPEAKER_00]: an F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a new filial generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a polyhybrid, but that's a
further podcast that I'm ready to have
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be an F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that plant was pollinated by the same
plant, if we cut two clones of that cream
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and pollinated that plant with the
same stuff, that would be selfed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that plant was pollinated by anything
else that was reversed, that is an R1.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we change the indication from S1 to R1
because self gets the S1, R gets the
[SPEAKER_00]: reversal indication.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if we take an S1, so we self a plant,
you self it.
[SPEAKER_00]: S1, Golden Goat S1, that exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a Golden Goat female and a Golden
Goat female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reversed one, made pollen, put it on the
girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got Golden Goat S1 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were to pull my favorite Golden Goat
phenotype out of there and repeat the
[SPEAKER_00]: process, cut clones of that one,
use one as a pollen donor, one as a pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: receiver, that would be a Golden Goat S2,
the second selfed generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see what you're asking and you were
correct in your thinking that it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: an S1 or an S2 or an F1 or an F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're correct with that thought process,
but I don't want to label it that because
[SPEAKER_00]: the original bag seed is where it came
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would call it cookies and cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bag seed would be what it started as.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be its own brand new thing
because I'm not certain about the pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: donor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is another part to this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, additionally, oh, this is a whole
nother category, a whole nother branch off
[SPEAKER_00]: of this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I've answered the first part.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about breeding labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the second part of
this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, if you could pick any land
race varietal outside of the modern OG
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies alien gene pool to hybridize with
the above project and add more stimulating
[SPEAKER_00]: narrow leaf buzz to it, what land race
would you choose?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to be to be frank, honestly,
I wouldn't breed with this plant because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's producing seeds and it's going to be
problematic in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I were to breed with the cookies
and cream plant, it's got that lay you on
[SPEAKER_00]: the floor sort of feeling that you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to put more head buzz into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got three options because I would
want to see the phenotype that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding with before I make my decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would narrow it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sight unseen, I would probably
pollinate that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a Brazilian plant, but the problem
with Brazilian plants, they grow wild,
[SPEAKER_00]: they get real tall, they're branchy,
they're out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just a fucking mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go every direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not really tame.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Brazilian land races go all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the buzz that fucking buzz from a
Brazilian plant, it gets to your brain,
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets me all wild, it gives me that
weird tunnel vision feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next option would probably be a tie,
cross it to a tie, because again,
[SPEAKER_00]: the tie is going to have a real
psychedelic head buzz, that real like
[SPEAKER_00]: energetic, euphoric sort of mind fuck sort
of thing, which I really love.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that tie is going to be so much easier
to grow than the Brazilian.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be more uniform,
more classic shaped.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be all over the place
and branchy and stretchy and crazy like
[SPEAKER_00]: that Brazilian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another option.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently was given a Nigerian haze
clone, which I've only gotten veg so far,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that thing is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a really nice structure to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stem rub smells good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may consider crossing it to that
Nigerian haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, those three, the Brazilian,
the tie and the Nigerian, I know that
[SPEAKER_00]: those have a crazy psychedelic head buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants have that kind of buzz that
when you smoke it, you get that
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelic feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a drum circle going.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the fire going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And next thing you know, it's the next
morning and everybody's like, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a great night hanging out with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, where did time go?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sort of buzz comes from those
Brazilian, the tie, the Congo,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Nigerian regions like that will
provide that crazy, crazy buzz in my
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see where we are in this
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably wouldn't breed with this,
but S2 is what I think you would call that
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would choose Brazilian, tie or Nigerian
to breed with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also got a Congo plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be fun to breed, but I'm keeping
that a little bit on the down low for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys haven't seen much of my Congo
work yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message wraps up with thank you for
offering this spot on your website for
[SPEAKER_00]: those of us who choose to avoid social
media and chat servers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can respect that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people out there in prohibition
land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't want to be on Instagram,
on discord, posting pictures of their
[SPEAKER_00]: ganja plants when they shouldn't be
growing it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand that the chat servers can
make you a little bit paranoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do respect the people in prohibition
land, but I'm glad you were able to reach
[SPEAKER_00]: out and ask this great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wrap it up with love and respect from
your friend from prohibition land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allegedly, bro, I know you're in
California where it's legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just trying to trick us into not
knowing where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy knows does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's how you say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe you a pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You win a free pack of seeds because I
read your message here on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, that free seed giveaway is
sponsored by our friends at seeds here now
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out seeds here now.com

[SPEAKER_00]: photo period seeds and lightning fast
shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another message here right in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend Michael,
and it goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says hi Rasta.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I am so happy and grateful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found your show, which was recommended
in the depths of a Reddit cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: AMA.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to everybody out there
supporting cannabis and of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: supporting iry genetics and the grow from
your heart podcast on Reddit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not realize that I had a following
or a ganja community out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm glad somebody mentioned to my
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoever that was and or is it goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I really appreciate your podcast
as you knowledgeably convey expertise that
[SPEAKER_00]: most would take years to realize if ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've got to give this info
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I didn't give out this if I didn't
share my experience and share this info,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would be bad karma or something and it
wouldn't work right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got to keep this going for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Google Scholar has a quote on
their website that says stand on the
[SPEAKER_00]: shoulders of giants and advancing my
cannabis journey and improving my future
[SPEAKER_00]: grow through your podcast feels very much
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come along for the journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have a DD and I read a lot and I
talk a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it ends up being a podcast is really
what's happening here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of passion for cannabis and I
want you guys to all grow and smoke and
[SPEAKER_00]: have access to the best ganja in the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, whenever I go to a concert and
somebody lights up weed and passes it to
[SPEAKER_00]: me, I can smoke it with confidence because
we spread the good word and everyone's
[SPEAKER_00]: growing good ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let me stay focused because
obviously whatever I smoked is fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: working.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I am an American living in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that sounds interestingly exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Germany may very likely trial legal
cannabis before full on legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this reason, I'm planning a grow
operation for both medical and
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational and exclusively on quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal is to bring the ethos of the
medical growers to Europe and demonstrate
[SPEAKER_00]: in Germany how an indoor living soil
system can shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, this sounds like a huge awesome
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud of you and I wish you the best
for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also be safe, be careful and stay legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you're doing it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But well, I wish you the best for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is hugely ambitious and I'm proud to
be a part of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I feel like I'm helping you out
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I've already done Dr. Elaine
Ingram's soil food web course,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was recommended by our friend Sean
up several hundred episodes ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our buddy Sean and also
big shout out to Dr. Elaine Ingram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ingham.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no R in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been saying it wrong the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elaine Ingham.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, it says I'm currently tackling
soil mineral balances and beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: insect IPM regimens to go fully organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's hugely ambitious as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope that works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not the organic grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find there a whole set of different
problems when it comes to growing
[SPEAKER_00]: organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm sure you've got a good team to
help you figure that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it does say I'm working backwards
through your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize if these topics have been
covered already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have about five questions about your
cultivars and terpenes for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to get fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I love talking about the strains
I bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terps are one of my favorite subjects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going to be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and also thank you for listening to
the catalog of podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a lot to catch up on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't ever feel afraid to ask a
question that you feel I may have answered
[SPEAKER_00]: already because I may have learned
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have changed my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technology, equipment, something may have
changed since the last time I talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feel free to ask your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may give a different answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may give a totally more in depth answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may give a shorter answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also not everybody listens to every
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feel free to ask your questions that
you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be worried about a repeat question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may answer it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may filter it right on out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to this person's questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does say as Germany will be a new
market, I'm betting it will likely be
[SPEAKER_00]: initially flooded with flashy names like
gelato and blue dream or the old school
[SPEAKER_00]: names like white widow and jack hair and
medium quality at best.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably going to be accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're also going to have a lot of older
folks looking for Panama red and purple
[SPEAKER_00]: haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the old stoner dudes are going to want
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they all ask for here in the
States goes on though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does say for this reason, I'm seeking
to stand out from the crowd and focusing
[SPEAKER_00]: so heavily on quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good way to focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people are just going to produce as
much as they can and try to get it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you produce a top shelf product from
the beginning and maintain that you will
[SPEAKER_00]: stand out your dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your sales will be top notch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me stay focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I can imagine that your cultivars are
your babies and you love them all equally
[SPEAKER_00]: but differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So which of your cultivars would you
recommend for a diverse for a diversity of
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences as well as medical
applications in a brand new and uninformed
[SPEAKER_00]: market?
[SPEAKER_00]: And why?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives me the opportunity to do a
little basic cannabis education and also
[SPEAKER_00]: pitch a couple of my lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which will work very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're opening a dispensary,
if you want a good menu of flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: this goes for anybody around the world,
any dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of believe that there are a few key
flavors or ranges that you should keep on
[SPEAKER_00]: the shelf and those things I wrote them
down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should always have fruity stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people love fruity weed,
especially the girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: The younger people really like fruity
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should also have gassy weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like weed that smells like gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the older more experienced
seasoned smokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have learned that the gassy stuff is
where the good buzz is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really like a good gassy aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other things you should have are floral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that smells like flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people really love a floral smelling
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other things I really like is a hazy
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are kind of spicier.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have your sandalwood,
your lavender sort of smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to come from the hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may also play into the floral side of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then another thing I really think you
should have is that cushy and chem sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: That OG cush, that chem dog chemical sort
of stuff that's different than the fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are things that kind of range is
what I think you should start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fruity, gassy, floral, cushy, hazy,
chemi sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let me tell you things in my lineup
that I can recommend from each of those
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with the fruit category.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of my stuff is really easily labeled
to identify into the fruit category.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first I would recommend is
strawberry starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes like strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows gigantic buds and it is also very
potent when grown, dried, and cured
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also makes amazing concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the strawberry starburst is one I would
recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then of course the sun kiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is platinum tangy to a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes like sweet oranges and once
again you're going to get a lot of good
[SPEAKER_00]: medical benefits from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good fat harvest and that one is super
easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another fruity one that I would recommend
may be the blueberry butcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's got that blueberry candy terps
and a really serious head buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next category we're going to work into
is the gassy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gassiest one in my lineup would be the
machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The machine puts out super gassy terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can smell it for miles away and it
grows super easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one that would fall into that
category is fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fist bump is sour diesel to a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sour diesel is super fuely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get those fuel aromas and
fuel terps out of the fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one I wrote down is floral.
[SPEAKER_00]: The character zero will have floral terps
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scarlet begonias will have the floral
terps to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people really seem to enjoy that
floral rose lavender sort of a terp that
[SPEAKER_00]: really gets a lot of people's attentions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing I talked about was a haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be harder to produce a
quality haze in a commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like a Neville's haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: A real good haze will take a long time to
produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like a silver haze or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want that real hazy flavor
something like that does take a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: longer to flower but something like a
super lemon haze will give you that hazy
[SPEAKER_00]: buzz without the length of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are usually 10 or 11 week flowers
which is short for a haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are saying 10 or 11 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: A long haze can go 16 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one that takes quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got two that take a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I wanted to recommend a hazy flavor
something that would have that hashy spicy
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor from my lineup I would say Sunday
show is probably the plant that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for for that flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one is kush and cam.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kushy chemi flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even describe kush properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's swampy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's earthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some moth balls and some some
funk to it some dirty foot and then also
[SPEAKER_00]: there's the chem that falls into the same
category which is similar but just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: chemically and kind of just funkier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to smell some good OG kush and
some good chem dog to actually I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: even describe it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that weed that when you walk through
the concert and you go that one that's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably a kush or a chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need those sort of aromas and flavors
that earthiness that chocolatiness those
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of fall in the kushy category.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for that category that I would
recommend from my lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one would be something that is
very new that will come out in May is
[SPEAKER_00]: called Kingston kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one that falls into that category
again is the machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will both give you a lot of chemi a
lot of kushy sort of turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may find some chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may find some chemicals in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of great flavors and aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would start with the fruit the gas
the floral the kush and the cam and then
[SPEAKER_00]: if you can fit it into the grow I would
work some haze into their next.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would definitely have something that
gives people a major major head buzz
[SPEAKER_00]: something to get their head spin in and
then I would also recommend something more
[SPEAKER_00]: on the Indica side to get them sort of
chilled out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I may also recommend something with
some CBD in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure the market for CBD in Germany
but here in the States a CBD product
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely would sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course the one I would recommend
for you there would be purple heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how to get you purple heart
seeds in Germany but we can do our best to
[SPEAKER_00]: allegedly make that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this question my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says which of your cultivars would you
recommend to a new breeder to start
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding unique phenotypes and then it
says you will be credited on all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow that is a really that's a really good
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thought was that I don't know
that I would breed with just my stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: because that kind of locks you in to a
trap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only made so many things and there
are only so many plants to work with from
[SPEAKER_00]: my lineup that I don't want to
accidentally steer you down the path of
[SPEAKER_00]: inbreeding and breeding yourself into a
box and not having options.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first idea would be to pick a male
plant or a female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say pick a male from my lineup
something that's got the traits you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would pick a female from other
breeders lineups or other several females
[SPEAKER_00]: from several other breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we can create diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only got so many male plants in my
lineup so everything is going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: golden goat in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's going to have a rise in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is going to have either
blueberry cookies or BC lemon skunk in it
[SPEAKER_00]: because I've only got so many options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could find a couple of things that are
not related and we could breed those but
[SPEAKER_00]: then if you wanted to work with anything
else in my lineup you've kind of worked
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself into a trap because it's already
got most of that shit in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you understand what I'm saying by
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did write down some good ideas though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would take one for myself and then I
would take a male from my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd probably pick like a jack tripper or a
fist bump male at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those would both be really fun to
find a good male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fist bump male and then like
something fruity from this Jill and then
[SPEAKER_00]: something really frosty from ethos and
then something really candy flavored from
[SPEAKER_00]: seed junkie and then just pick something
from everybody else out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something really frosty and terpy from
exotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go find something from every breeder
out there that you enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who you're into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breed it to the Cindy 99 from Mr. Soul but
use my male and pollinate a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: different females to create diversity is
what I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it had to be from my line I would
breed the I would choose a fist bump male
[SPEAKER_00]: and I would pollinate a John lemon female
is what I think I would do right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those would be really awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would get a lemony sour diesel kush
haze combo sort of a thing that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the amazing shit that would have
all of the good stuff that you need and it
[SPEAKER_00]: would grow vigorously.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would taste super dank and I would have
an amazing fucking buzz and then I would
[SPEAKER_00]: do it the other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also I do fist bump to John lemon just to
see what the difference is.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right then there is another question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says how would you recommend increasing
terpene content as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one I'm going to say that I've
recently done multiple podcasts about
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just one thing that you can do to
increase terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything has to be correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light has to be right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The air, the water, the soil, the
nutrients, the dry backs, the harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: time, especially the drying cure process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything has to be perfect to get the
terpenes dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just add one silver bullet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just do one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to get the whole chessboard
dialed in and check mate that motherfucker
[SPEAKER_00]: to get yourself the perfect terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says do you know to increase any
particular terpenes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed that in lemon strains,
strains that naturally produce high
[SPEAKER_00]: limonene, if I get them too close to the
light and give them a little bit of light
[SPEAKER_00]: stress, especially with an HPS,
that will heavily increase the limonene
[SPEAKER_00]: production in plants that naturally
produce limonene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So put them a little too close to the
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch them freak out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you smoke them, they're going to be
fucking super tremendously lemony.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, cold, a little bit of cold at night
will bring out temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to tell you to go too
extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go more than 10 degrees in your
diurnal difference, your day and night
[SPEAKER_00]: swing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can get it kind of warm during
the day and then a little bit colder at
[SPEAKER_00]: night, that will bring out some flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the science behind that,
but in my experience, that has been a good
[SPEAKER_00]: way to bring out some flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also get all your nutrients dialed in,
add some kelp, add some carbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbs and sugars are definitely going to
help with that flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've already done a full podcast on
getting the flavors and aromas,
[SPEAKER_00]: but get it all dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feed a lot of carbs, a lot of sugars,
a little bit of kelp in there and then dry
[SPEAKER_00]: and cure properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also it's proper strain selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to select the proper strains for
terpene production.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, there is one more part to this
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, have you noticed any influence
from either companion plants producing
[SPEAKER_00]: different soil exudates or if the terpenes
and pheromones of other plants in the room
[SPEAKER_00]: influence the terpene profile?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I don't grow like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just grow in a very sterile grow room
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not doing living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't use companion plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are ganja plants in my room,
so I don't really have any useful
[SPEAKER_00]: information on this part here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I honestly don't have any useful
information on if companion plants or
[SPEAKER_00]: their exudates or their terpenes will
affect the other plants in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't know that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any science behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is above my pay grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dude, if anybody out there does have
any feedback on that, send me a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will read the feedback on the show
because that is one part I definitely do
[SPEAKER_00]: not have a good answer for.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do wrap this message up though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, also influenced by you,
I now send mental hugs to my mom in Texas
[SPEAKER_00]: daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I finish a podcast of yours,
I'll feed her Zane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, that is super cool that I make you
think about your mom that you're sending
[SPEAKER_00]: her a hug every episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost Mother's Day, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time this episode comes out,
I think we've got like two and a half,
[SPEAKER_00]: two, maybe three weeks before Mother's
Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So heads up, stoners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set an alarm on your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write it down on the grow room calendar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get mama card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get mama some flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that shit lined up now, you guys,
because we all know without mama,
[SPEAKER_00]: there ain't shit happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm friend Michael.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.

seeds in Germany, please do reach out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Explain your method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Explain that neither one of us are going

[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we can help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not comfortable sending to Germany
to be quite honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do owe you some sort of a prize.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can't get you seeds to Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll send you some t shirts or
something because I do appreciate the
[SPEAKER_00]: great content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, thank you, my friend for the
great message.
