[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rasta Jeff in the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode number 293 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis news, education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_01]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_01]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_01]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Kat, Kude and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, I just took a giant
dab to get together more frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I'm dabbing on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I dabbed on some Do-Si-Do sauce
earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, that stuff tastes tremendous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm smoking the Skywalker batter and
Do-Si-Do's sauce today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining me, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get too far, let's cover some
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: This podcast is brought to you by my
friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking to add some new genetics
to your garden, look no further than the
[SPEAKER_01]: Hella Dank Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find them at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check them out and support
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I owe a huge thank
[SPEAKER_01]: you to everybody who has sent me some
birthday gifts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also owe a huge thank you to my friend
Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the month of February, this podcast
received over 100,000 downloads in the
[SPEAKER_01]: month of February.
[SPEAKER_01]: February is the shortest month of the year
and I broke a record in the month of
[SPEAKER_01]: February.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, thanks to everybody that listens on
every other service.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, iTunes and all the other
services do not provide very good
[SPEAKER_01]: statistics or information or data to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: iTunes just kind of opened up some data,
but it's not very thorough yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's their beta.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stitcher gives me a lot of info.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Stitcher showed me that I had 100,000
downloads in the month of February and
[SPEAKER_01]: that blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you to everybody listening on
Stitcher and thank you to everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: listening on all the other services.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I owe a huge thank you to everybody
who contributed to Patreon in the past and
[SPEAKER_01]: in the month of February.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, in February, I broke another,
we broke another record.
[SPEAKER_01]: You broke another record.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put out the content.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys contribute to Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys broke another record.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge thank you to everybody who
contributes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't already know what I'm
talking about, let me tell you guys about
[SPEAKER_01]: Patreon really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you've already heard about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patreon is a website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patreon is a service that allows you as a
listener to financially contribute to
[SPEAKER_01]: podcasts and other content creators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to Patreon, type in maybe your favorite
content creator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there's an artist on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there's a musician on there that you
want to support.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have got a Patreon creator page
where you can financially contribute to my
[SPEAKER_01]: efforts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what will happen is you'll go to
patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: You read all the information about the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll read my promises to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll read my goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you feel like contributing,
you type in a dollar amount and you can
[SPEAKER_01]: contribute to my show.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I will do with those funds,
I'm going to use them to buy a new MacBook
[SPEAKER_01]: Pro.
[SPEAKER_01]: My computer is going slow enough to have
me a little bit worried.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't use it excessively anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't use it for things that it's not
necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been trying just to use the computer
just for recording purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it lasts as long as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is my new goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to replace the MacBook with the
Patreon contributions.
[SPEAKER_01]: That may take quite a while, but I'm going
to do the best I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will also throw in my own funding,
but I'm trying to do it the most I can
[SPEAKER_01]: from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just really helps me and makes my life
easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: A new MacBook is quite pricey,
but that's what's going to happen with the
[SPEAKER_01]: Patreon contributions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyone that contributes to Patreon,
thank you for the help.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are keeping the podcast going.
[SPEAKER_01]: It keeps the website alive and it's going
to keep the computer that records the show
[SPEAKER_01]: alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, speaking of Patreon, one of my
promises on Patreon is that if you
[SPEAKER_01]: contribute a specific amount, that I will
read your email on a future episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I didn't have any sort of
notification set up on my Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a few people contributed and I never
read their emails and I realized it and I
[SPEAKER_01]: got to their emails as soon as I could.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you feel like you contributed to
Patreon and I did not read your email that
[SPEAKER_01]: you expected read, just send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say it again because I stuttered in
the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me an email and say, Hey dude,
I contributed to Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm expecting my email read.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's my email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Resend it and I'll get to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I promise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have a way to know that people
were contributing and expecting that
[SPEAKER_01]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wasn't, I didn't have Patreon set
up correctly to notify me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I missed a couple and I'm trying to be
accountable and catch up and read those
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here is one of those that I did miss.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this person was polite enough to reach
out and say, Hey bro, I contributed and
[SPEAKER_01]: you never read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's a repost of my email and it goes
like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's great that you say Babylon is
plagued by ignorance and oppression and
[SPEAKER_01]: the wisdom and knowledge I spread is our
best tool because a lot of what inspired
[SPEAKER_01]: me to do a podcast was reading forums and
reading things on the internet that were
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely incorrect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things that were going to cause more
problems for people's gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that made me say, shit, I need to step
up and do something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought the best thing I could do
would be write a book.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I realized that a book would be
ever changing because the episode I wrote
[SPEAKER_01]: about drawing and curing two years ago,
I've learned so much since then that it
[SPEAKER_01]: would be a new book now and the old book
would be obsolete.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think podcasting is ever evolving
and I can put out new content as soon as I
[SPEAKER_01]: learn it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I ended up podcasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That ignorance and plague of Babylon and
that oppression is part of what inspired
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to keep my Rastafari ideas and my
Rasta talk and thoughts to myself,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I don't think that's what people
are listening to the podcast for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you say the wisdom and knowledge
I spread is our best tool to fight and
[SPEAKER_01]: rise above the injustice and oppression
surrounding the sacred herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: That really speaks to me as a Rasta man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that lets me know that I'm doing
exactly what I need to be doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that I am right where I need to be
helping the people I need to be helping
[SPEAKER_01]: the way I need to be helping them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a huge compliment and it meant more
than you thought it would.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he says, keep educating people,
give thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I love to educate and I will keep it
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as I can, you guys, I keep
promising more episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm almost to 300 and I see no end in
sight.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reason to stop doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as this microphone that computer
and this throat work, I will keep putting
[SPEAKER_01]: out podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The email keeps going.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Up until recently, I was a grower at a
large state licensed medical production
[SPEAKER_01]: facility here on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, there's nothing like a good
podcast to keep you flowing and vibing
[SPEAKER_01]: through a long day in the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would look forward to your podcast each
Monday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, the folks I worked for
didn't exactly believe in growing from the
[SPEAKER_01]: heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I chose to move on to find an
operation with more like-minded values and
[SPEAKER_01]: put the patience and plants above profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, much respect for doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a challenging thing to do in
this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finding owners and managers and investors
that have the heart that the growers have
[SPEAKER_01]: is one of the largest challenges I've
faced in this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll keep going with the email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your podcast inspired me and helped me and
helped give me the strength and confidence
[SPEAKER_01]: to move on and follow my heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't thank you enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, your email is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're working at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I work at a boutique veganic
caregiving operation that puts out quality
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine above all else.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, it looks like you worked hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You found your way in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You realized it wasn't what you wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a good background and now you're
where you want to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: That deserves props right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good start, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good start.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to leave somewhere when you've
already got employment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's harder to go look for
employment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easier to go to a job that sucks than
it is to go look for a new job is what I
[SPEAKER_01]: think I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So man, that took some balls to get out of
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm doing, I'm glad you're at a
veganic caregiving operation that puts out
[SPEAKER_01]: quality medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet the patients there love your product
and I bet you love the patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you like your job better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're going to put out a better
product in turn.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The email keeps going.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I apologize for the long email,
but I figured I should sneak in a grow
[SPEAKER_01]: question while I'm at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey dude, no need to apologize for a long
email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get quite long winded.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it's okay that you do also.
[SPEAKER_01]: The email continues.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoyed your recent episode on
fire safety and you guys, this email was
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of a long way back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just didn't find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there was an email or an episode
about fire safety that did happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have to go search through the
feed, but it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, it got me thinking about
something else pertaining to safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's often overlooked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you mind sharing any knowledge you
have in regards to eye protection in the
[SPEAKER_01]: grow room?
[SPEAKER_01]: When I worked for the dispensary,
they provided special HPS safety glasses
[SPEAKER_01]: made by Phillips, like the bulb company at
my new garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was surprised to see everyone just
rocked standard polarized sunglasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sensitive to bright light and prefer
not to fuck around with my eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I dropped some dough on a pair of
method sevens.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you like to rock for eye
protection when you're at three rivers
[SPEAKER_01]: under that sea of Gavitas?
[SPEAKER_01]: The research I've done suggests that
working under HPS lights unprotected for
[SPEAKER_01]: extended periods of time, long-term may
cause some scary effects on eye and skin
[SPEAKER_01]: health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, do you wear long sleeves?
[SPEAKER_01]: I recently started to as an effort to cut
down on the allergic reactions on my arms
[SPEAKER_01]: from being elbow deep in trichomes all
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I figure it also helps minimize my
skin's daily UV exposure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any insight would be much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I wanted to let you know I've been
jamming some Gregory Isaac and dabbing on
[SPEAKER_01]: some key lime pie, live sauce,
rolled in some CBD isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, you're going in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, apologies for the long-winded
email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much love from Maine, Rasta.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he says his name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he says, please don't say my name if
you're reading on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I won't say your name, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will listen back and make sure I
didn't say your name at all in the episode
[SPEAKER_01]: as I was reading this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking, you didn't say your name
anywhere else, so I didn't have the
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't say your name.
[SPEAKER_01]: More cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, thanks for the great email.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, let's talk about Gregory Isaacs and
key lime pie, live sauce.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's got to be a perfect day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just chilling some nice, smooth,
old school reggae and some nice live sauce
[SPEAKER_01]: rolled in CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be mellow and just
chilling out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a good day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of makes me want to take a dab to
tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I'm going to press pause.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get some fresh water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we get back, we're going to talk
about eye protection in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's three tokes and you're tuned in to
the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Podcast rolled.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am back and I am heavily medicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: This Skywalker batter is a little heavier
than I remembered.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably should have only take one dab,
but I think three was okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm giving it a smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only way I can describe it is it
smells like Skywalker.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, it's got like a coffee sort of
smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always say coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of the OG smell,
they have a hint of coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if coffee was across the,
if coffee is being roasted in the room
[SPEAKER_01]: next door, that's kind of what it smells
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Roasted coffee with a little bit of earth,
maybe in a hint of mud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that doesn't sound appetizing,
but it's that earthy humus smell that I
[SPEAKER_01]: really love.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like a earthy coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe a vanilla top, maybe a very
light flavor of vanilla on the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Took a couple of fat dabs, got nicely
medicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about the appearance here a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like somebody melted a piece of
golden butter in this glass container.
[SPEAKER_01]: The middle has a nice chunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like dark butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if the butter sat out and got kind of
dark, it is that color.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then around it, it's got a puddle and
that puddle is mostly turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just where the turpings have leaked
out and dissolved outside of the batter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the batter is sitting right there in
the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I tip the container a little bit,
I can see that puddle of turps run to the
[SPEAKER_01]: edge a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I get myself a dab, I go in the
middle and get some of the battery part.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I rub it around the edge and get
some of the turps on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I get the full flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get everything I want out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some pretty good Skywalker batter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad I was able to get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if there is any more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to our friends at the Garden of
Weedon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great work.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, I'm well medicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get back into this email.
[SPEAKER_01]: This email was all about eye protection
and they're not asking mainly about eye
[SPEAKER_01]: protection like eye safety, wearing eye
goggles from getting poked and while
[SPEAKER_01]: mixing things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're asking more about eye protection
underneath all of the grow lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: We spend a lot of time in grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: The grow rooms have thousand watt high
pressure sodium lights or thousand watt
[SPEAKER_01]: metal halide lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're in them all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this guy brought up a very good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing I wanted to say is that
your eyes are the most sensitive organ in
[SPEAKER_01]: your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: That are exposed to the elements all day
long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your eyes are really sensitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the most sensitive thing on the
outside of your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also one of the things you use
the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I could survive without my
other senses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could get by in the life safely and not
feel completely in danger and crippled all
[SPEAKER_01]: the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But without my vision, I don't know that I
could survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't want to think about that too
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be the one sense that would
make me the most vulnerable if it were
[SPEAKER_01]: taken from me, is my vision.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: So protect your eyes at all costs,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only under the lights, but when you're
mixing, when you grab a bottle of
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients and you're thinking about mixing
it, put on goggles before you grab it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gloves and goggles.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should be sitting next to each other
at your workstation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gloves and goggles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before you pick up the bottle,
because when you pick up that bottle of
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides or nutrients and you go to
shake it, maybe the guy that used it
[SPEAKER_01]: before he was in a hurry and he didn't put
the lid on all the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You pick up that bottle, you give it a
little shake, those pesticides or those
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients, or whatever it is, could come
flying up right out of that bottle into
[SPEAKER_01]: your eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: You weren't doing anything but just going
to mix it up and you haven't even started
[SPEAKER_01]: applying it yet and you already got to go
to the eye doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So eye protection is super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to spray something,
eye protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this email addresses more protection
from the lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wear some sort of protective glasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: He asked, what type of glasses do I wear
when I'm under the sea of gavitas at Three
[SPEAKER_01]: Rivers?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have got two pairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a pair of Method 7 glasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three Rivers was kind enough to gift me a
pair when I started there and then I
[SPEAKER_01]: bought my own pair so that I've got a
backup pair because I kept leaving.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got multiple gardens and I would just
leave them places.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I've got two pair for when I forget
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got one pair that they're not as
heavy but I've got another pair that's too
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like them and they protect me well from
the lights and I like that I can see the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants differently, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a pair of Oakley 5 squared with
polarized lenses that I wear if I'm just
[SPEAKER_01]: walking into the groves to go do
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are my normal daily sunglasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just throw those on to walk in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm going to go in there and do some
work, I'll put on my Method 7s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell a difference in the way the
plants look.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see more of the plant with my Method
7s.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: The colors are correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can identify things better.
[SPEAKER_01]: The colors are more clear on each plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell the difference between the
black cherry, the platinum tangy,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the critical mass by the colors a
little bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: The colors stand out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just like seeing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can identify if there's a problem or if
something's coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see it better with the Method 7s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I can tell they're protecting my
eyes better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got one pair of Method 7s that was
bought for me by the company and they say
[SPEAKER_01]: Method 7 and then they say HPS with a plus
on the little bottom of the lens.
[SPEAKER_01]: That plus means they've got an extra
coating that is designed for rooms with
[SPEAKER_01]: more than 10 lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got the super protective Method 7
glasses and I can tell the difference when
[SPEAKER_01]: I do use them and when I don't because
honestly, sometimes I'm lazy and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: irresponsible and I don't use my Method 7
glasses and when I'm driving home and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: dark, that's when I notice that I fucked
up and didn't wear my glasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't bug me during the day when I'm
working, but when I get in the car and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's dark and my eyes have to try to
adjust, the headlights coming toward me,
[SPEAKER_01]: they shine in the wrong directions and do
weird things and it's just because I
[SPEAKER_01]: stressed my eyes under those grow lights
all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wear the Method 7s when I'm thinking
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm in a big grow, I like the Method 7
glasses that say HPS plus on them because
[SPEAKER_01]: those are designed for larger rooms,
for brighter rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer them because I can feel a
difference in protection in my eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like them because I can feel the
difference after work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like them because I can see the
difference in the plants and I like them
[SPEAKER_01]: just because I feel like I can see the
room and the plants better overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nobody pays me to say this,
you guys, they're not, I'm not sponsored
[SPEAKER_01]: by them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I paid cash for one pair and I was gifted
another pair by my company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I Method 7 does not pay me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just advice that was brought up by
somebody who cares about your eyes as much
[SPEAKER_01]: as I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Method 7s work well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Polarized glasses are not enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether they are expensive Oakleys,
whether they're your Ray-Bans,
[SPEAKER_01]: if they're the cheap ones from the mall
where you can get six pair for fucking 22
[SPEAKER_01]: bucks, regular polarized glasses aren't
enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the science behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not do the research.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell by my eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell when I don't wear my Method 7s
the next night when I'm that night when
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm driving home, my eyes are fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I wear the Method 7s, I can see
better and I don't have as much of a
[SPEAKER_01]: struggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it affects my sleep as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any science behind that,
but I feel like when I close my eyes at
[SPEAKER_01]: night and I've stressed my eyes,
my eyes feel differently and I sleep
[SPEAKER_01]: better when my eyes weren't stressed all
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no science behind that either.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just my body and what I think I've
observed myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So protect your eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, you only get one set of eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think about it, the treatment for
eye damage is fucking horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: My gramps had to get shots in his eyeballs
and I could not imagine that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am cringing right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: My toes are all fucking tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: My stomach's all clenched.
[SPEAKER_01]: My butthole's all tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even imagine taking that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got to lay his head back all relaxed
on this table, on this chair thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they hold his eyeball open with this
thing and they tell him, look as far to
[SPEAKER_01]: the side as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he looks way over there and they stick
a needle in his eye, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they put medicine in his eyeball.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys take care of your eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care of your eyes, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy is bringing up such a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a couple hundred dollars in sunglasses
will make your eyes and you won't have to
[SPEAKER_01]: get injections in your eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: My gramps is gone now so he doesn't have
to do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: But holy shit, I couldn't imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: That dude was a fucking tougher man than
me by a long shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love you, grandpa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, let's keep going with his email
answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy also says, the research I've done
suggests working under HBS lights
[SPEAKER_01]: unprotected for extended periods of time
can cause some scary effects on the eye
[SPEAKER_01]: and the skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are not supposed to be under those
kinds of lights all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's definitely causing some sort of
eye problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cover your eyes in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The skin, you should wear long sleeves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should have long sleeves on all the
time in the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: The email also says, do you wear long
sleeves?
[SPEAKER_01]: I recently started to as an effort to cut
down on allergic reactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you should be wearing long sleeves
not only because of the lights,
[SPEAKER_01]: not only because of the allergic reactions
to the trichomes like you're saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: but because there are pesticides in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're just rubbing around on things
all day that are gonna irritate your skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just imagine you're not spraying the
pesticides on yourself, but you're
[SPEAKER_01]: spraying them on the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're rubbing up on those leaves
all day every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're absorbing a little bit and a little
bit and a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over a long time, that little bit
could add up and cause a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, wear eye protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wear long sleeves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wear gloves all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I walk to the back of the grow where
the work part happens, gloves go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if I'm walking through with upper
management, even if I'm walking through
[SPEAKER_01]: just to do supervisory tasks to go find
the crew and let them know what the next
[SPEAKER_01]: tasks are to go tell them, hey guys,
30 minutes to lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might want to start wrapping up this
part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put on gloves then just in case I
decide to grab something back there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to touch anything in the grow
area without gloves because I treat the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire grow as a pesticide contaminated
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've applied pesticides to every plant in
every room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we've walked through there with our
clothes and shoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we've dragged all those pesticides
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I put on gloves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wear long sleeves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had an incident where I was mixing a 250
gallon reservoir with nutrients and I
[SPEAKER_01]: spilled nutrients on the edge of the
reservoir because that shit happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just drop a couple of drops.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get a rag later and you clean
it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't clean the rag before I leaned on
it to put my pH pin in there to see what
[SPEAKER_01]: the pH was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just rested my arm on there and stuck
the pH pin in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw pH is right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get off the ladder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go get the rag to clean it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go wipe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wiped it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go cleaned up the tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said go wiped it up, but whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to tell you what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went and wiped it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put the lid on the tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pressed go on the pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kept working.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a few minutes later I was like,
oh shit, my arm is on fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had fulvic acid on my arm and it was
fucking burning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had picked it up from resting my arm
on the top of the tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that because I had just wiped
fulvic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had just put fulvic in the tank and I
just wiped it off the top where I spilled
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm pretty sure I just stuck my arm in
there while I was adjusting the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just measured the pH with the pH pin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used my right hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I leaned on the tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would make perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I picked up fulvic acid on my arm and
burned myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now if I had long sleeves, that probably
wouldn't have happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if I had long sleeves, maybe I would
have absorbed more of it and burned more
[SPEAKER_01]: of my arm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure, but long sleeves is always a
good idea in the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also have a set of backup clothes in the
grow in case you do some shit like I did
[SPEAKER_01]: and you are wearing long sleeves and you
stick your arm in the fulvic acid,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you can just go take off the long
sleeve shirt, clean your arm up,
[SPEAKER_01]: put on a fresh shirt and you'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should always have a backup change of
clothes in your grow all the way down that
[SPEAKER_01]: you should have a pair of shoes,
a pair of socks, whatever kind of style
[SPEAKER_01]: underwear you prefer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not getting picky on you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to wear a cup,
do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just kidding about wearing a cup,
but some of you guys need a cup in your
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever kind of pants you're going to
wear, a fresh shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a lady, whatever kind of bra you
wear, whatever kind of sports bra,
[SPEAKER_01]: have a whole fresh set of clothes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got long ass dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got an extra dreadlock hat and a
whole extra set of dreadlock whatever I've
[SPEAKER_01]: got.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a fucking hair tie and a hat and
a wrap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I could tie my hair up in six
different fashions if I needed to for
[SPEAKER_01]: different situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all in the car, but just have fresh
stuff because if you spill something on
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself at work, you may need to get out
of those clothes quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want whatever pesticide you're
using, any pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want any pesticide on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if it's something totally organic,
I don't need that shit on me for any
[SPEAKER_01]: longer than it needs to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to change clothes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to get that cleaned off of me
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wear long sleeves, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pesticides are bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lights are bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been working in grows for a long time
and I've been in the same grow at three
[SPEAKER_01]: rivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been in the grow at three rivers for,
I'm counting time in my head and trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: go quickly while I do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been there for 13 or 14 months and I
have seen what a high pressure sodium
[SPEAKER_01]: light can do to a hydro table.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had the same, there's one table.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mother plants have been on the same
area on the same hydro table tub,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a Botanicare eight by four table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been there since I started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the light is fucking eating this
table, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's changed it colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a totally different color.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's starting to kind of break down
and deteriorate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not from the nutrients because
it's up on the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nutrients go in the bottom of this
table.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go, they may be touching there,
but I'm certain it's the light fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: destroying this table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also the tops of the fans, they're not the
right color anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those white fans, they're all like this
orangey.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like cigarette smoke,
but it's just the light breaking it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those grow lights are serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not supposed to be that close to
that much light all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are mimicking the sun for the plants
and it's working and we're using
[SPEAKER_01]: electricity and chemicals to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're dancing around under it all
day and not covering our skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something we should think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get yourself any sort of weird skin
cancers for your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to pay you enough for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're trying to, so now you're going to
have to smoke more weed to not get cancer
[SPEAKER_01]: from the cancer that you're getting from
the lights that you're using to grow the
[SPEAKER_01]: weed that you're smoking to not get
cancer, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just going to be a terrible cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's not do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's cover ourselves up, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: This email is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do try to wear long sleeves.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it gets hot as fuck in the gross
sometimes and I catch myself running
[SPEAKER_01]: around in a t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, this guy's got the right idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, I recently started as an effort
to cut down on allergic reactions to my
[SPEAKER_01]: arms being elbow deep in trichomes all
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also figure it helps minimize my
skin's daily UV exposure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he said any insight would be much
appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I gave you a lot of insight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I rambled on a lot about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cover your eyes, cover your arms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also wear a hat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The top of your head is exposed to those
lights all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm six foot five, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can feel those grow lights on my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm six foot five and I've got dreadlocks
to my knees.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not an exaggeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of my dreadlocks are as big around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking for something a similar size
as the diameter of my dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are as big around as my torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not even a joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm using a blazer torch and a couple of
my dreadlocks are the diameter of this
[SPEAKER_01]: torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not an exaggeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of fucking hair on my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll wrap my hair up in my head and put it
on top of my head and put a hat on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll hear other people say,
it's hot in this grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I laugh.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm touching the goddamn light with my
head, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think you're hot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Come over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get up on this ladder and hang out up at
my level.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hot, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes I catch myself with just a
t-shirt on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I catch myself without the proper head
gear, without the proper glasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I notice that I'm gonna pay for it as
I'm getting older.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Since I'm talking, let's give one more
good piece of advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those grow lights are sucking all of the
moisture out of your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drink more water when you're working in
the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hydrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're working hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably wearing long sleeves and a
hat and gloves and shoes and long pants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're working hard and sweating your
ass off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those lights are just cooking you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drink more water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take good care of yourself, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's enough talk from old man grandpa
Jeff trying to get you youngsters to take
[SPEAKER_01]: care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do a few shout outs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always shout out to my friend Zach M.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also to Andrew and Todd.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for all the support on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I truly appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, before I start
wrapping up, I wanna leave you with some
[SPEAKER_01]: words of wisdom, some reminders,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are all cannabis ambassadors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are all representing this cannabis
plant in our own way.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are, like I said earlier,
a grower, a smoker, an activist,
[SPEAKER_01]: or if you're just curious about it,
if you are here, you are representing
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in some sort of way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please, let's all work together to do it
in a positive way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's all work together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's stop working against each other in
the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to join forces.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to be positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to represent cannabis in a
positive light everywhere we go if we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to represent cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that is your fight, stick with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't embarrass cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't embarrass the rest of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it responsibly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it like an adult.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it carefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it at the right place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do it positively.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's all stick together, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also keep in mind that there is a time
and place for cannabis and cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: activism and cannabis speaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not always the time and it's not
always the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go push your cannabis talk in the
wrong platform and embarrass yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go smelling like cannabis at the
wrong place and look like an asshole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a little bit of respect for places
that don't want you smelling like cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't smoke cannabis in places that would
offend people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we are part of a revolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are trying to do our thing,
but we also need to keep in mind that the
[SPEAKER_01]: dumb shit we do is what holds us back from
getting this court with this plan.
