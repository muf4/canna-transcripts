[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 505 of the Grow
From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by my friends at Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular, feminized,
or auto flower seeds in your garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend Seeds Here Now,
and you can find them at www.seedsherenow
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of ice cream,
live batter from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of I-95 and Screaming OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, the flavor is described as
gas, mothballs, and fabric softener.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have talked about this concentrate
before on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely agree with that flavor
description.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely love that flavor,
and I absolutely love the buzz from the I
[SPEAKER_00]: Scream live batter from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back of the package, it says the
product does contain 65.04% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot
Labs for the delicious I Scream live
[SPEAKER_00]: batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
pimps and hoes, friends and foes,
[SPEAKER_00]: smokers and growers, all you bad
motherfuckers out there, this is one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the long-awaited mix episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this episode, I'm going to talk
about my nutrient regimen and how I mix my
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, we are going to start
with the clone mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will work our way into the veg mix,
and then the next episode will be the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of the flowering mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to the mix part of this
episode, let's do some shout outs to a few
[SPEAKER_00]: of our friends from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with a big giant Grow From
Your Heart podcast shout out to my friend

[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, podcast world, now it is time for
you to bust out a notebook and a pen or
[SPEAKER_00]: pencil, or maybe bust open a note app on
your phone, because I am going to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: very detailed lesson on my very specific
nutrient mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot to this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will try to be as clear as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will try to give as many details as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to make it easy for everybody
to understand, so I'll try not to ramble
[SPEAKER_00]: too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ladies and gentlemen, with no further
ado, let's take a deep dive into my
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into this, I want to say
that nobody pays me to advertise their
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients or products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not have any paid sponsors or
advertisers on this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I am talking about is because I
really do use this in a commercial grow
[SPEAKER_00]: setting or in my personal grow setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of this is product placement.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of this is advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Rasta Jeff grow style.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please don't think I'm doing this
episode just to sell you some product,
[SPEAKER_00]: just to be a shill for some company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to mention a lot of specific
products and a lot of very specific
[SPEAKER_00]: brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of those brands or companies or
people paid me anything to do this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an episode to help my listeners,
because a lot of people are very curious
[SPEAKER_00]: about what I do in my grow, in my specific
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to know my specific stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to tell you what I do in my
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to tell you a lot of things that
I have learned through a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: experimentation, through a lot of trial
and error, through buying and trying a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of different products, through reading a
lot of forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned a lot by doing a lot of side
by side comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the advantage of working in
multiple commercial environments,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that means I've got facilities all
over Colorado where I can do experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as the plants come out happy
and we reach our goals, I'm able to play
[SPEAKER_00]: with the nutrient mixes and the grow
styles a little bit at each facility and
[SPEAKER_00]: see what works and what does not work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also been growing and experimenting
with nutrient regimens in my own personal
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens for countless years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't even talk about how long because
I may allegedly have started doing that
[SPEAKER_00]: before we had any type of legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been mixing nutrients and
experimenting with products for quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: while.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I have discovered works best
for me in my personal grow as well as in a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have also found that these types of
nutrient mixes are very replicable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can write SOPs for these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do a podcast for these mixes and I
can teach people how to do it on a very
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent basis, which comes in very
handy when I'm training people in a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get myself back on track because I
did say I was going to try not to ramble a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: My point here is that nobody is paying me
to do this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody has paid me a nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody has given me anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I'm doing and I want to share
it with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about my nutrient mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this works for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may not be perfect for you,
but I have learned that this mix and this
[SPEAKER_00]: grow style works very well for what I am
trying to do in a commercial and in a home
[SPEAKER_00]: grow type environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, I like to use
cocoa as my base for my small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will use 70 to 80 percent cocoa and 20
to 30 percent perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that having 20 to 30 percent
perlite in my cocoa makes a nice fluffy
[SPEAKER_00]: aerated mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we do overwater those pots,
we don't have to worry about all of that
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa compacting and crushing and
suffocating my roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the smaller plants, I do 70 percent
cocoa and 30 percent perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: For my larger plants in three gallon pots,
I like to use 70 percent cocoa and 20
[SPEAKER_00]: percent perlite and 10 percent persolite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Persolite is basically larger and chunkier
perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're mixing the three gallon pots,
when you're mixing large batches,
[SPEAKER_00]: it really helps fill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also adds a very nice aeration to the
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, again, if somebody in the
cultivation facility does overwater those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, we don't suffocate those roots
with that compacted cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got plenty of perlite and plenty of
persolite in the containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ideally, we would have 70 percent
cocoa, 20 percent perlite and 10 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: persolite.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do not have access to the
persolite, if you don't want to add the
[SPEAKER_00]: persolite to your mix, just do 25 percent
perlite and your plants will be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cocoa will be plenty aerated for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will give a lot more detail about pot
sizes later, but I generally start from a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use an easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go from the easy cloner into a four or
six inch net pot with that 70 to 30
[SPEAKER_00]: percent mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once the plants are large enough,
I move them into a three gallon fabric pot
[SPEAKER_00]: and that three gallon fabric pot,
that's where I like to use the 70 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa, 20 percent perlite, 10 percent
persolite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very well mixed up in the three gallon
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my commercial environment, I finish in
the three gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the time that it takes those pots
to dry down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm able to get two waterings in a day on
a very large plant and I'm able to fit
[SPEAKER_00]: enough pots on a table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see a need to do larger pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see a need for more transplants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I generally go from the cloner to a six
inch net pot to a three gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is that plant forever pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's its finishing home.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I am talking about cocoa and mixing
your perlite and persolite, one thing I
[SPEAKER_00]: should mention for you is make sure you
rinse your cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you rinse your perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you rinse your persolite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also wear a mask when you are playing with
the perlite and persolite.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to rinse all of these products
because they are dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: That cocoa was made overseas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bunch of cocoa husks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was crushed together, put into a
container and shipped to the states on a
[SPEAKER_00]: ship.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may have a bunch of salts in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may have a bunch of unknown stuff in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who you are buying your cocoa
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some companies have very salty cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rinse that out before you put your
plants in it or you will shock,
[SPEAKER_00]: burn and kill your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also recommend you rinse your perlite
and your persolite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also recommend you wear that dust mask
when you're working with the perlite and
[SPEAKER_00]: persolite because you don't want to
breathe in that little dust that comes off
[SPEAKER_00]: of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is like inhaling glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cannot be good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please take care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so we have covered the pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We usually use a cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use a clone machine or clone
plugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I go into that four or six inch net
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got my 70 to 30 percent mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will go into a three gallon fabric
pot where I use that 70, 20, 10 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my reminder once again, rinse all of
your stuff, your cocoa, your perlite,
[SPEAKER_00]: your persolite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you rinse all the excess salt
out of your cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wash all that dust off the perlite and
persolite and wear a mask when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: playing with the perlite and persolite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I feel like we've got the
containers covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are making great progress on this
episode in my commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to make an auto watering system.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many variations on an auto
watering system.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some places, I have machines mixing
nutrients and no people have to even touch
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little machines spit out this much CalMag,
this much nitrogen, this much phosphorus
[SPEAKER_00]: into a reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: A mixer mixes it up for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another machine measures the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's too low or too high, it spits in
the appropriate up or down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it feeds that to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little sensor in some of the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that moisture meter gets to the right
meter, it stops watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it gets too dry, it waters again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some facilities are very automated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them we've got to mix up the tanks
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we plug in a pump and that pump
waters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in all situations, in all flower
rooms, it is ideal that I have got some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of a drip feed or sprinkler or
emitter or auto water system in all flower
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is so much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is much more consistent and the plants
really enjoy and appreciate that type of
[SPEAKER_00]: consistency and timing and how much water
they get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you use the right type of emitter
or sprinkler, I think you really add just
[SPEAKER_00]: enough oxygen to the mix to make the
plants go kapow when you water them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my commercial environment,
I have always got my flowering plants on
[SPEAKER_00]: some type of an auto watering system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the size of my plants and how
old the plants are and the environment of
[SPEAKER_00]: the room, sometimes the plants get watered
once per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to water right as the lights come
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to water within the first hour of
the lights coming on if I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in a commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we've got multiple rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we've got a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we can't water every room right
at nine o'clock because we can't be in
[SPEAKER_00]: every single room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the lights come on at eight or
when the lights come on at nine,
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to water this room as quickly as I
can and get to this one and then get to
[SPEAKER_00]: this one and get all of the plants watered
within an hour of the lights coming on so
[SPEAKER_00]: they can use all of that water all day,
metabolize all of those nutrients and just
[SPEAKER_00]: get to work and get to action.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, in a commercial environment,
by the time the lights come on,
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants are usually ready for a drip
feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had a drink of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had a long night.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a lot of activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are thirsty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to water right when the lights
come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if the plants are large enough,
if you work in a commercial environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: you might want to water right before you
leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way they aren't dead when you come
back the next morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on the size of the plants in a
three gallon pot, I'm usually watering
[SPEAKER_00]: first thing in the morning and then later
in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm watering right as we leave for the end
of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to water my plants to 20 percent
runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want runoff every time I feed and water
those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since I'm using cocoa, I am putting
nutrients in my water every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am feeding these plants every time I
water because cocoa does not hang on to
[SPEAKER_00]: the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nutrients just fall right out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They rinse right out along with the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm adding nutrients at every watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most commercial environments in
Colorado, I am not using our RO water.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, at this time, I am not using
reverse osmosis water in any of my
[SPEAKER_00]: situations, in any of my cultivations.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of the commercial grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of my home grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of my friends grows that I'm helping
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not using any RO water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a big boy filter or something
simple like that is good enough here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have got good water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when you start going with RO water,
it makes it a little more challenging to
[SPEAKER_00]: pH balance everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit more of a struggle if
you are not experienced and I don't find
[SPEAKER_00]: it necessary here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got great water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take good care of our water.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need to struggle with the RO.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a tremendous amount of waste
when it comes to RO.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do not do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I do is I frequently check the
pH and the EC of the water that comes out
[SPEAKER_00]: of my tap in all of my facilities and my
home grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your local water company changes the
chemicals they put in their treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on this season, we are using water
for different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on the seasons, we are using
different amounts of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would imagine there are different
problems that occur in water that are
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in different seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably get different allergies in
the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably get different shit in the
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably different based on your
location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they treat the water differently at
different times of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a good idea just to get a
little bit of water and put your pH pen in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, put your EC meter in there and just
know what's coming out of your faucet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always good to know what you're
starting with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mark that down occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, always mark down the pH and the EC
or the PPMs or the TDS of any solution you
[SPEAKER_00]: mix to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make that a habit.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you mix up your nutrients,
as soon as you're done, grab your pH meter
[SPEAKER_00]: and grab your PPM pen and just stick them
both in your nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch for it to register what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be somewhere between 6.1 and 6.5
and then I don't know what's on your EC
[SPEAKER_00]: meter over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be real high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be real low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just depends on who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But write that shit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe later, if you've got a problem,
you can look back and you can go,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, look, on Tuesday, I fed it way too
high of PPMs and it didn't like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or when your crop is done and it's
awesome, you can say, what did we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do that all over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to write down a lot of
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I write down everything I put in the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a Google document for every
commercial grow I work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the guys mix up, they write
something, they write exactly what they
[SPEAKER_00]: put in the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five mils of this, 10 mils of this,
six mils of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They write it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They write down the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: They write down the EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they water the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the plants get watered, we collect a
little bit of the runoff off of each
[SPEAKER_00]: table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have another Google document that
says room A, table one, pH runoff,
[SPEAKER_00]: EC runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we mark that for each table for each
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're documenting every nutrient that
goes into the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we are documenting the pH of that
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are also documenting the PPMs of that
solution before we feed it to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we are also documenting the pH and
PPM of the runoff that comes out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pots after we water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I rarely need to use that data for
anything, but when I do need it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is always very obvious where the
problem started and what the problem was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always helps us diagnose a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's just through a process of
elimination, we can look and see,
[SPEAKER_00]: look, the pH coming out is just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The EC coming out is just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not the feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be something else in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look and see if we've got bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is why I document everything when
I feed the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds excessive, but when you've got
multimillion dollar commercial facilities
[SPEAKER_00]: at your hands and you've got multiple guys
working, guys and gals working in these
[SPEAKER_00]: places, you need accountability and
documentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said a moment ago, if something
goes wrong, it's always nice to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: look back and say, this is where we messed
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's even better when shit goes right
and you can look back and go, do it
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly like this all over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you've got every nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got every reading you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just replicate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it all over and you can have
repeatable outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody gets bonus checks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another detail I should talk about is in
my commercial environment is everything in
[SPEAKER_00]: flower is underneath a thousand watt
Gavita double ended light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use the thousand watt double
ended bulbs in a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think that's where I get the best
performance from the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people will have different
opinions and ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my favorite is the Gavita thousand
watt double ended bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: That works wonderfully for everything I've
tried to put it through for every plant it
[SPEAKER_00]: performs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is what I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like to have my plants up off the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use those greenhouse tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have them cussed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have them built for the length of the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are generally six foot wide and the
length of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come with trellis bars that you
attach to the tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the table sections are six or
eight feet long in each six or eight foot
[SPEAKER_00]: long section.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know exactly how many plants of each
strain fit in that section.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a very beautiful plan for setting
up those tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got greenhouse tables that are the
length of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're six feet wide and they move 18
inches left or right so that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: function in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make an aisle and then when you're
done working, you can push all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: tables all the way to the right side so
that you can just have one walkway at the
[SPEAKER_00]: left side of the room and not waste a
bunch of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the tables I like to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, everything is on a drip feeder
or some sort of an auto feeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got plants on tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're auto fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really efficient to work in these
rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to get in there and hang
up trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to get in and bottom and
defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made it really easy for the crew to
get work done in these rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's focus on a few different
approaches to feeding the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep talking about my commercial
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial grow, we're watering every
plant at least once a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we are watering plants twice a
day just depending on the performance and
[SPEAKER_00]: the environment and the pot size and how
much water they go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that everybody is in a
different situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to try to make this work for
everybody's grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also keep in mind that everything I say
works for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of this is set in stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a rule book.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my standard operating procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can adjust this to work for you
however you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can add, you can subtract steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can modify this to work however you
would like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to share with you my
standard operating procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I encourage you to adjust this and
custom tailor this to work for your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'm going to try to give you
examples to where this will work for
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple different setups.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my first example, I will tell you what
I do in my commercial environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial grow environment where I'm
watering every day, sometimes multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: times a day, I don't find it necessary to
feed every nutrient or every bottle or
[SPEAKER_00]: every product to my plants every time I
water them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get a lot of opportunities to
feed these plants so I break up the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients throughout the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a big commercial grow, I will feed base
nutrients at every watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm using veg bloom, I will put in a
veg bloom base mix at every watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm using new millennium, I will use
either autumn gold or summer shift or
[SPEAKER_00]: equinox or something similar to that at
every watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will rotate a series of other
products which I call boosts throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on Monday, we will add those base
nutrients, whether it's the veg bloom mix
[SPEAKER_00]: or if it's the new millennium base mix,
I will start with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then on Monday, maybe I'll add
something like Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on Tuesday, maybe we'll add
something like Plus Life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on Wednesday, maybe we'll add
Epsom salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will add different things throughout
the week so the plants get fed all of
[SPEAKER_00]: those different nutrients or all of those
different products, but I don't blast them
[SPEAKER_00]: to the plant all at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will do a base mix on every watering
and then I will write a list of boosts and
[SPEAKER_00]: they will be listed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just being hypothetical because I
don't have a week or I don't have an idea
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, but I'll write on the board Cal
Mag, Plus Life, Lightning Start,
[SPEAKER_00]: Epsom salts, maybe something like that in
a row.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be three of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be seven of them for the entire
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we do is we just rotate through
that list.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said on Monday, you mix up your
base nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to use base nutrients every
time you look at the list, you go,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, it says Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you put however much Cal Mag is
required into the mix and then you just
[SPEAKER_00]: write the date next to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put Cal Mag in here on Monday,
the first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way we know Monday, the first,
it got Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tuesday when we come in, we do the base
nutrients because we do that every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just move to the second one on the
list.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what I said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to guess that it was probably
Plus Life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we mix in the appropriate amount of
Plus Life and then you mark on the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Tuesday, the second, I added Plus Life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the third or on the fourth day,
whatever, because by day four,
[SPEAKER_00]: people start getting confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's me working, if it's another guy
working, he just looks at the board and
[SPEAKER_00]: goes, today is the fourth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to put in the fourth product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if he's at the bottom of the list and
we've done them all, you just simply go
[SPEAKER_00]: back to the top of the list and start all
over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes it very easy to keep those
boost products fed to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very easy way to schedule it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very easy way to keep my staff
on top of what has been done and what
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a backup plan, we are also writing
all of those nutrients that were put into
[SPEAKER_00]: the solution in that Google document.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if somebody forgot to update the board
or if you're not sure what was on the
[SPEAKER_00]: board, maybe you can't read some
handwriting or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've always got that Google document as
a backup plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that method, we're going to call that
the base nutrients every day and add a
[SPEAKER_00]: boost throughout the week method.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the rotate the boost method.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really have a name for it,
but that's how we do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use base nutrients every day and then we
add a booster throughout the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will do this to my veg plants and my
flower plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how I assign nutrient schedules in
a commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way to do this is a lot of people
like to mix up a big fat tank of really
[SPEAKER_00]: strong nutrient mix on Monday,
feed it everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we going to feed the plants this
week?
[SPEAKER_00]: They get it all on Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every product, every bottle, every
nutrient, put it all in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: feed the plants all of that on Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then throughout the week, since we're
feeding in cocoa, we're just going to feed
[SPEAKER_00]: them base nutrients, maybe some cow mag
because they will need it if we're just
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding them on Mondays.
[SPEAKER_00]: That method does work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works for some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works in a commercial grow,
but that is not my preferred method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way to do it is to simply fill
your reservoir on Monday, put everything
[SPEAKER_00]: you need in there and use that reservoir
throughout the week and just keep feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: it that same nutrient mix all week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have got several options.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do what works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the thing that I do is I feed my
base nutrients every day and throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the week, I rotate different add ons or
different boosts into my mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to make decisions based on
how often you're available or how often
[SPEAKER_00]: you're able to mix nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you mix up your nutrients every single
day like I like to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you be there every day to mix those
nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you mix a fresh batch of nutrients
every single morning or can you only show
[SPEAKER_00]: up on Monday?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you only show up on Mondays and
Wednesdays?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going to be the things that
determine how you mix and how often you
[SPEAKER_00]: mix and how you run your nutrient regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a very hands on grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a very hands on staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's a big part of it for me is I
know that I've got a staff and I know
[SPEAKER_00]: there's going to be people there seven
days a week that are going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: hand mix these nutrients if I need them to
and make sure that every plant gets the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people don't have that luxury.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people want to take a day off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people want to go on vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people have a day job and a family
and they aren't able to focus and spend
[SPEAKER_00]: that much time on a grow every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going to be the types of
determining factors that decide how you
[SPEAKER_00]: set up your grow and your watering style.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a couple of options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to mix everything on Monday
and feed that throughout the week?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to do base nutrients and
boosts every day of the week?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to feed a big blast on Monday
and then just do nutrients and Cal Mag
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the week?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are things you'll have to think
about and plan ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going on vacation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to have visitors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to have to take a new job?
[SPEAKER_00]: Something's going to come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just plan ahead when you were thinking
about how you were going to water and mix
[SPEAKER_00]: your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I should talk about is clean
your reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you are mixing your nutrients in,
whatever container or tank you are keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: your nutrient solution in, it is going to
get funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drain it occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it get completely dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use some sort of a product and clean it
really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once you've cleaned it really well,
let it dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then rinse it out really well to make sure
there is no leftover cleaner in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't mix that up with our nutrient
solution and cause problems to our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I should have mentioned
previously, but it just now dawned on me
[SPEAKER_00]: is please make sure to calibrate your pH
meters and your PPM meters and any sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: meter or device you are using that gives
you a reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please calibrate that stuff at least once
a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend every week if you can take the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we have got a good foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what kind of pots to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what to put in the pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that we are auto feeding these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that these pots are on tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know they're under a thousand watt
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about a few different options
on when and how to mix up our nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: and how to water the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I think it is time to actually get
more in depth on the nutrient mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to break this up into several
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be two.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be three.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could end up being four episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am at the first episode, so I can't tell
how long it's going to take yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the schedule that I am going to give
for my nutrients is a nine week flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to focus on a nine week
flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I talk about is probably
measured in milliliters per gallon or
[SPEAKER_00]: grams per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the things I use are dry powdered
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will try to be specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it changes, I will really try to pay
attention and talk about different units
[SPEAKER_00]: of measure very specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said at the start of the show that this
works for me and my grow style and my
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in my environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to pay attention to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to pay attention to your leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend doing runoff reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do a full episode on runoff reports
way in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one will be a long ways away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of stuff planned before
that, but you must pay attention to the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what I say, no matter what you
think, no matter what your equipment says,
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter what your meters say,
the plants are the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't look happy, adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are not going to adjust to the
meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to adjust everything to the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are always the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: The owner of the facility is not the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: The investors are not the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: The consumers are not the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those plants are the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants in that grow room, those are
your bosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you've got a whole room full of
girlfriends and you've got to learn to
[SPEAKER_00]: make all of them happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I just realized I've
been talking for like 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could use a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really need a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to press pause for a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I get back, I will tell you how I
mix up my clone solution and we will get
[SPEAKER_00]: this mix episode really moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a dab with me and I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world, I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am heavily medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: During my break, I took a bunch of fat
dabs of cowboy Kush full spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of H.A.O.G and Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is described as earthy,
fuel and leather.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy that funky earthy,
fuely flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure I got leather out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I did get was a punch to the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one kind of makes me lazy,
makes me want to sit down and chill out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also makes me nice and focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this should be good podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right back into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I took my dab break, I said I was
going to tell you how I mix my solution
[SPEAKER_00]: for my cloners.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, I run easy
cloners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run turbo cloners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run all of the automated arrow cloners
you can think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also run the traditional tray and dome
type clone setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: In all of those environments, I use that
basic purple clone X dipping solution and
[SPEAKER_00]: the yellow clone X cloning solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I am using the tray and clone plug and
dome technique to make my clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will generally buy a bunch of rapid
router clone plugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will soak those rapid routers in a
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just water and the yellow clone X
cloning solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the purple dipping stuff, but the
yellow solution in the taller bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will mix that to approximately a 1.0 to
1.5 to EC and I will adjust the pH of that
[SPEAKER_00]: solution to 5.7 to 6.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I put those rapid routers in the
little trays and their little slots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dip them into the purple clone X
solution and put them gently into the
[SPEAKER_00]: clone plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I place a dome over those clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I close the vents and I put it under a T5
light with that light fairly close and I
[SPEAKER_00]: do not touch those clones for
approximately three to five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I basically ignore them until it looks
like they need some water.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they need water, I will re-moisten
them again with that same solution,
[SPEAKER_00]: not the same bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't have that same solution laying
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will remix a fresh batch of the same
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is water and that clone X yellow
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll mix it up in an EC of 1.0 to 1.2 and
again I will adjust the pH to 5.7 to 6.2
[SPEAKER_00]: and I will saturate those clone plugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let it sit open for a minute while those
plugs are saturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then before I close it, I will dump off
all of the water that has ran out of those
[SPEAKER_00]: plugs that is in the tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way they're not sitting in too much
stagnant water but the clone plugs are
[SPEAKER_00]: nice and saturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put the dome back on there and
probably leave them alone for a day or two
[SPEAKER_00]: before I begin cracking those vents slowly
and start introducing more airflow to
[SPEAKER_00]: those clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is basically the feed,
the mix that I use for my clones in a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a very similar thing to my clones in
an easy cloner or a turbo cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most important things is to
clean everything on the turbo cloner or
[SPEAKER_00]: the easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure it is sanitary and sterilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to sanitize the cloner and the
clone plugs every time I use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start off with the clean machine and
set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then fill your reservoir on your clone
machine to the appropriate level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add the yellow clonex solution until you
reach an EC of 1.0 to 1.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really easy to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your water in the reservoir to
the level you want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your EC meter in there and add a very
small amount of the clonex solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now stir that around with your meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're stirring it all around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that solution all in that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what does your EC meter say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it say 0.6?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it say 1.2?
[SPEAKER_00]: 1.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it says 0.6, you obviously need to add
a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go very slowly when you are adding your
nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: But slowly add until you reach that EC of
1.0 to 1.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go a little bit too high,
you can just add more water and dilute it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may take a couple of tries to get it
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to pay attention to how much of the
solution you added to the water to achieve
[SPEAKER_00]: that 1.0 to 1.2 EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe right down, I used 30 mils and
it got me really close.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I had to start using a dropper to
get it dialed in where I wanted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe you need 50 mils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how big your reservoir is,
so I don't know how much to tell you to
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you to get it to 1.0 to 1.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's fun learning how to dial that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You add solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You measure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say I'm too high or too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: You either add more solution or you don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's way too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have to add water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You end up putting in more solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just keep playing that game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until you get it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have got the appropriate EC,
that is when you adjust the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not adjust the pH until after you have
achieved the appropriate EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going to add more water or more
nutrients, there is no need to correct the
[SPEAKER_00]: pH at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is filled appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the right solution in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is at the right pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I cut my clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dip them into that purple clone X gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put them in the clone collar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put them to where they stick about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's about an inch, maybe a
little more, maybe a little bit less than
[SPEAKER_00]: an inch is exposed on the bottom side of
the clone collar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the water being misted hits the bottom
of that clone and makes big fat roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any part that is going to be under the
clone collar, I try to coat it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: clone X solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a very in-depth episode on
cutting clones in an easy cloner,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we don't need to talk too much about
that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the next day, you will find that all
of that purple gel has fallen off of your
[SPEAKER_00]: clones and it is now in your water,
in your reservoir, in your cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggest that you unplug the cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the top portion off of the cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where all the clones are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take that off and just set it on the
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you set it down on a level table,
you won't damage the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not sticking out far enough to
cause any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just set that down somewhere where you
don't mess up the bottoms of the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will be safe for a few minutes
without getting sprayed on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use your meters to measure your pH and
your EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that purple clone X gel solution
dripping off of your clones has changed
[SPEAKER_00]: the pH and the EC of the water in that
reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that sprayer spraying overnight has
changed the pH and the EC of the water in
[SPEAKER_00]: that reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've had some evaporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've had some mix time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've introduced more oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things have changed over the past 12 or 24
hours and we need to correct them so that
[SPEAKER_00]: our clones will survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So open up the cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use your meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Investigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out the numbers and adjust
accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the pH went too high, make it lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the pH went too low, make it higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the EC is too low, make it higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the EC has gotten too high,
add more water because some water may have
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayed out of the cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some water may have evaporated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what could have happened
overnight in your cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are countless opportunities and
possibilities when it comes to working
[SPEAKER_00]: with easy cloners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we've got the cloner open,
this is a good time to add another
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to add something called Clear Res.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to add Clear Res today and every
five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means we need to mark it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever the date is today when you're
adding the Clear Res, right, I put Clear
[SPEAKER_00]: Res in here on Tuesday the 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on the 6th, you need to add 30 more
milliliters of Clear Res.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that cloner is going again in five
more days, add 30 more mills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it probably shouldn't be going for
another round of Clear Res.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it is, make sure you add it and
write it down every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may sound crazy, but even if you run
the grow by yourself, write things down
[SPEAKER_00]: like somebody else is going to come and
help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Act like there is another person that
needs that information because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot on our mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The world is overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help yourself out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just leave yourself a little note.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little hint, a little path, a little
treasure map.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give yourself a clue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take as many detailed notes as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you mark down when you are
putting Clear Res in the reservoir so that
[SPEAKER_00]: you know that it does get done.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, you have basically got your
EZ Cloner on autopilot.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you have to do is open it up every
morning and check the EC and check the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if those are correct, you can leave it
alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one of those needs to be adjusted,
adjust accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the EC has gone too high because water
is evaporated, add water.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you add water, check the pH again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will need to be adjusted.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the EC has gone too low, add more
nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, correct the pH again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're always going to be checking and
adjusting the pH in these EZ Cloners.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very important, but it will make
strong, fat, healthy clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the clones that come from these EZ
Cloners, I personally think they take off
[SPEAKER_00]: a little more quickly and they're a little
more healthy than the clones that come
[SPEAKER_00]: from the clone plugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they just have a little more
kabang to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is my basic feed for my clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am basically mixing up that Yellow Clone
X clone solution at an EC of 1.0 to 1.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm adjusting my pH to 5.7 to
6.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am doing that if I'm using Rapid
Rooter or whatever type of clone plugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if it's a Rockwool plug, I'll do the
same mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I'm using a Turbo Cloner or an EZ
Cloner or some type of an Aero Cloner,
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the exact same mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have more maintenance and more
things to do throughout the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is one more detail I should mention
when it comes to cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do personally like Permaclone clone
collars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is a blatant advertisement for a
product, but I like them because they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get moldy and they don't get funky
and they don't fall apart and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: sanitize them and reuse them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reusable clone collars are worth every
penny in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's less stuff to throw away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's less stuff to buy again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can just sanitize it and keep using
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend Permaclone clone collars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's work our way into talking about
the small veg mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once my plants come from the cloner,
I put them into a four inch or a six inch
[SPEAKER_00]: net pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where I like to use 70% cocoa and
30% perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are going to be in these four
to six inch net pots for approximately two
[SPEAKER_00]: to four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on the strain and how
these plants perform, but be prepared for
[SPEAKER_00]: them to be in these pots for approximately
two to four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of your faster growing strains,
they'll be ready for an up pot in
[SPEAKER_00]: approximately two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of your OGs and your slower growing
cushions, we'll leave them in these
[SPEAKER_00]: tighter pots for closer to four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about what we're going to
feed our small veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I consider these small veg until I
transplant them into their three gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they will become large veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what I feed my small veg
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got two options for base nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some of my facilities, I am running veg
bloom powdered nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you have seen the veg plus bloom
logo at your local grow store or somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy, I really am satisfied with
the outcome and the quality of my product
[SPEAKER_00]: when I use veg bloom base nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Veg bloom offers several different types
of base nutrients depending on the type of
[SPEAKER_00]: water you have in your location.
[SPEAKER_00]: They offer an RO base nutrient,
which is for reverse osmosis water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They offer a dirty, which is for places
with what they consider dirty water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They offer another product called hard,
which is for places with what we would
[SPEAKER_00]: consider hard water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They recommend a water test.
[SPEAKER_00]: You check your water, you look on their
website and they will make the appropriate
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most cases, you're probably going to
want the dirty or the HD unless you're
[SPEAKER_00]: running RO water, then you obviously want
RO.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in many cases, I am running veg bloom
base nutrients, but also in many
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities, I do like to use new
millennium nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: New millennia makes a great line of
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the way the plants perform
and I really like the way they have broken
[SPEAKER_00]: down the bottles and the way to feed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will give you a couple of different
options of how I feed my small veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, my veg plants are hand
watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not in an auto watering system
until they get into their three gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are being watered by a pitcher or
something similar to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting watered by a person who is
paying attention to every plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: My nutrient solution is usually mixed into
a large reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've usually got 30 or 50 gallon
reservoirs for the veg rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what I am mixing into my
nutrient reservoirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually start with five grams of veg
bloom powdered base nutrients per gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm using veg bloom, I'll repeat that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I am using veg bloom, I use five grams
of powdered base nutrients per gallon of
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm using veg bloom, if I am not using
veg bloom, I will use and pay attention
[SPEAKER_00]: because I don't use these at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I either use veg bloom or new millennium.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I use the new millennium in my small
veg, I will use three milliliters per
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon of Equinox and nine milliliters per
gallon of summer shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got two different options here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the veg bloom or the new
millennium base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will add this to whichever base I
have chosen to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will use five milliliters per gallon of
water of Ruby.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will also use one milliliter per
gallon of water of lightning start.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are either using that veg bloom base
mix or we are using the new millennium
[SPEAKER_00]: base mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't use both bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will burn the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then to that base mix every day,
I am adding five milliliters of Ruby and
[SPEAKER_00]: one milliliter of lightning start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want this to be very clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you do not use both of those bases
because you will ruin your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one example for the base would be three
milliliters of Equinox and nine
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliters of summer shift along with
five milliliters of Ruby and one
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliter of lightning start.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one base setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other base setup option is five grams
of veg bloom base nutrients plus five
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliters of Ruby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus one milliliter of lightning start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are your options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do both of them, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I made that very clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we are going to feed one of those as a
base mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were doing the daily blast,
they get that every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing the Monday mix,
they get that every Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these are the things that I would add
to that mix as a boost on a daily
[SPEAKER_00]: rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would start off with plus life.
[SPEAKER_00]: The day I transplant those plants,
I would like to mix a half gram per gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: of water of plus life into my nutrient
solution and feed it to the plants on day
[SPEAKER_00]: one of transplant to get that mycorrhizal
fungus and get those beneficial bacterias
[SPEAKER_00]: started in my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get them nice and healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get those roots going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I start with a half a gram of plus
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my first boost.
[SPEAKER_00]: My second boost is Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot recommend how much Cal Mag you
feed your small plants because I do not
[SPEAKER_00]: know which brand of Cal Mag you have
purchased.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to make a recommendation and
ruin your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: On your bottle of Cal Mag, it will
recommend how much to feed your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: based on their size.
[SPEAKER_00]: When your plants are little, I recommend
you use half of what that bottle
[SPEAKER_00]: recommends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to suggest a little bit more
so that you use more so that you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can get away with half of that
bottle's recommended Cal Mag while your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are little.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on day one, we're going to boost with
plus life.
[SPEAKER_00]: On day two, we're going to boost with Cal
Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: On day three, I want to use five
milliliters of lightning start per gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're mixing up a 10 gallon res,
you're going to put 50 milliliters of
[SPEAKER_00]: lightning start into that reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got five milliliters of lightning
start as our third boost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on day four, I would like to use one
gram of Epsom salts per gallon of water as
[SPEAKER_00]: my boost on day four.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are using our base nutrient mix
every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then throughout the week, we are rotating
our boosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are starting with plus life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're moving to Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're doing lightning start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on day four, we are adding Epsom
salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: On day five, I do not add a boost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will skip that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on day six, we're going to go right
back around and start with that plus life
[SPEAKER_00]: again and repeat the cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will repeat that cycle on my small
veg plants until the day they are
[SPEAKER_00]: transplanted into their three gallon pots
and they begin receiving their large veg
[SPEAKER_00]: feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for your small veg mix, feeding in
cocoa, with a nice perlite mix,
[SPEAKER_00]: I do recommend you adjust the pH of your
solution to 6.1 to 6.4 before watering
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the small vegetative mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to feed that again until
we transplant them into the three gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know I've said this a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I repeated this a whole bunch,
but do not double up on those bases that I
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either use a new millennium base or use a
veg bloom base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either one will work wonderfully and it is
up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is okay to use a veg bloom base and new
millennium additives.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is okay to use a certain brand and add
another brand if you understand what you
[SPEAKER_00]: are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a pretty good map here and I will
get us to our goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you don't double up on those
bases, this will be a beautiful mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just please don't double up on that base
mix that will fry your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will have a terrible experience and
then you'll send me an angry email and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to tell you, bro, I said don't
double up on the base.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a quick recap on that and we will
move into the large veg mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the options of a veg bloom base
or a new millennium base.
[SPEAKER_00]: That veg bloom base is simply five grams
of your base mix per gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's either RO, dirty, hard,
HD, whichever one you select, five grams
[SPEAKER_00]: per gallon of water is your veg bloom base
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: To that you will add five milliliters of
ruby and you will also add one milliliter
[SPEAKER_00]: of lightning start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your other option if you go with the new
millennium base mix is three milliliters
[SPEAKER_00]: of equinox and nine milliliters of summer
shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: To that you will also add the five mills
of ruby and one mill of lightning start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are your two options.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a base, then I'll recap quickly our
boosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to use Plus Life, Cal Mag,
lightning start, Epsom salts, then skip a
[SPEAKER_00]: day and always adjust that to 6.1 to 6.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that's a quick recap on the
small veg mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means it is time to work our way into
the large vegetative feed mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when we move our plants into three
gallon fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we use that 70% cocoa,
20% perlite, and 15% persilite mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to keep these plants in these
three gallon pots until harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my facilities, they live to the end of
their life in a three gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to veg in these pots for
approximately three to four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they will flower in these pots for
approximately eight to 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this lesson, we're going to focus on
nine weeks, but let's talk about the veg
[SPEAKER_00]: mix for my large veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you've got the options of a veg
bloom base mix or a new millennium base
[SPEAKER_00]: mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: The veg bloom base mix is very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is five grams of veg bloom base
nutrient powder per gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you carefully weigh five grams
per gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a 10 gallon reservoir,
you're going to want to put 50 grams of
[SPEAKER_00]: veg bloom base mix into that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you start with the five grams of veg
bloom, then you're going to add to that
[SPEAKER_00]: five milliliters per gallon of water of
ruby.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're always going to use ruby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ruby is fulvic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fulvic acid makes your nutrients more
available to your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the simple way to put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is like adding an octane booster to
your gas tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are paying a lot of money for all of
these expensive nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: By adding a little bit of ruby,
you unlock more potential so your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: can absorb more of those nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of a turbo charge or an
octane booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's always add five milliliters of
ruby per gallon of water, just about every
[SPEAKER_00]: time we're mixing up nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's stay focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are working on the veg bloom base mix
for large veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have started with five grams of veg
bloom base powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have added five milliliters of ruby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's also add one milliliter of lightning
star from new millennium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is one of your base nutrient
options.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going with the veg bloom,
you've got five grams of veg bloom powder,
[SPEAKER_00]: five milliliters of ruby, and one
milliliter of lightning star.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is another option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, don't mix this with the veg bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll kill your plants and you'll be mad
at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is your other option if you want to
use a new millennium base mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend four milliliters of Equinox.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two milliliters of autumn gold and 10
milliliters of summer shift per gallon of
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's four Equinox, two autumn gold,
and 10 summer shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then to that, we are going to add that
standard five milliliters of ruby.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want that fulvic acid in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we are also going to add one
milliliter of lightning star.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lightning star is to help develop roots,
healthy roots make fast growing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're always going to add the ruby and
the lightning star to our veg mixes just
[SPEAKER_00]: to give them a little turbo charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are your two options for large
veg base mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we are going to work in our boosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if you want to mix all of this up
on Monday, you can do this as a Monday
[SPEAKER_00]: mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to do this as a boost
throughout the week, this is how I would
[SPEAKER_00]: suggest it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start the week off with that
plus life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on day one, we are going to add a half
a gram of plus life per gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: One half of a gram per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on day two, we're going to go with
Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I can't make a recommendation on
how much Cal Mag you add to your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: because I don't know which brand of Cal
Mag you have purchased.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got the GH brand of Cali
Magic, you can probably use one to two
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliters per gallon and your plants
will be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next day, I would recommend we
use five milliliters of lightning star.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add that to the one milliliter that you're
already using because this is a separate
[SPEAKER_00]: boost.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're adding this to give a little more
root development and make the plants go a
[SPEAKER_00]: little faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then our next boost is going to be Epsom
salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: One gram of Epsom salts per gallon of
water on day four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on day five, we are not going to add
a boost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we are going to go right back to the
start with our half gram of plus life and
[SPEAKER_00]: repeat the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it is plus life, Cal Mag,
lightning start, Epsom salts, and just
[SPEAKER_00]: repeat that cycle until these plants go
into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for my large veg mix, I will recommend
that we do adjust the pH to somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: between 6.1 and 6.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, make sure you are getting
plenty of runoff when you are watering
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we are making great progress
on the mix episode here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have talked about what to feed our
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have talked about what to feed our
small veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we've got a solid idea of what
to feed our large veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more thing I feel like I
should make sure to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this stage of the game, it is really
important to have a solid integrated pest
[SPEAKER_00]: management strategy in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to make sure not to get bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is almost time to put our plants into
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't like putting plants into
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is a pest problem, I'll do my
best to eradicate that problem before we
[SPEAKER_00]: go into bloom, because once you were in
bloom, you were very limited on your
[SPEAKER_00]: options for getting rid of bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you are working on some sort
of integrated pest management strategy,
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple modes of attack, multiple
methods, pay good attention, have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: indicators in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a whole nother episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I wanted to make sure to add into
that part was when I apply a sprayed on
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide, I always mix in a product
called push.
[SPEAKER_00]: Push is from Veg Bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do recommend that you don't mix push
with other products, but if I am applying
[SPEAKER_00]: a pesticide, I always add the recommended
dosage of push to that pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a foliar feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if I'm going to put something
shitty on the plants, they may compromise
[SPEAKER_00]: their health, that I can offset some of
that damage by adding something healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that good healthy product is
push.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every time I apply a pesticide,
I mix a little bit of push in the mix and
[SPEAKER_00]: spray that onto the plants as recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like to use push once a week with
or without a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm not applying a pesticide,
I will mix up the recommended dosage of
[SPEAKER_00]: push.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe it's 50 milliliters per
gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shake the shit out of it and apply that to
the plants when the lights are off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like I can see the growth that
comes from using push.
[SPEAKER_00]: So push is another product I like to use
throughout the entire veg phase,
[SPEAKER_00]: right up to the time I start seeing buds
sites develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Push is a great product and I think I can
actually see the results from using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something you can add is push about
once a week at 50 milliliters per gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: applied as a foliar feed and also add it
every time you apply a sprayed on
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, smokers and growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that concludes my first mix
episode I really hope you learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you enjoyed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lot of fun teaching you about what
I feed my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the next episode, we will work our way
into my flowering nutrient mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of great things to share
with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please stick around for that one.
