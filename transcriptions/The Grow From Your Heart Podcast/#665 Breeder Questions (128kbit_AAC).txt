[SPEAKER_00]: great to see you there join the party we
do a lot of fun things there are probably
[SPEAKER_00]: people hanging out right now in the
discord server chatting talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: growing talking about life talking about
music having random conversations if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got grow questions questions about
just about anything irie genetics somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: is there to answer that question for you
even when I am not there qualified people
[SPEAKER_00]: are there to help you out that sounds like
I got a 1-800 number or something now
[SPEAKER_00]: that's pretty cool join the club the irie
genetics discord again there is a link in
[SPEAKER_00]: the show notes and in the video
description hang out join the army it is a
[SPEAKER_00]: good time I look forward to seeing you
there I do pop into the live chat
[SPEAKER_00]: occasionally I've been trying to hang out
there more I keep saying it's got my face
[SPEAKER_00]: on it I should be more involved so I do go
to the irie army discord I hang out take
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs in the live chat chat with the folks
that hang out there try to be involved
[SPEAKER_00]: show some appreciation I do a chat in the
chat rooms quite a bit I post pictures
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a strain specific section now in
the discord if you want to know anything
[SPEAKER_00]: about any I read genetic strain there is
probably a post about it in the discord
[SPEAKER_00]: it's got its own strain specific section
if you want to read about a rock guys
[SPEAKER_00]: click on a rise I posted a photo there a
bunch of people have posted grow reports
[SPEAKER_00]: you can learn a lot on the discord join us
also I did post some new merchandise to
[SPEAKER_00]: the web store everybody on the discord and
on the patreon got the first notifications
[SPEAKER_00]: about that new merchandise you're hearing
about it here on the podcast there are
[SPEAKER_00]: some new items in the store make sure you
check out the irie genetics store go to
[SPEAKER_00]: irie genetics dot com click on the store
that will take you right to my web store
[SPEAKER_00]: where you will see the new merchandise
there are several new items you may enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: go take a look if you are part of the
patreon or part of the discord you got an
[SPEAKER_00]: early notification so maybe sign up there
and you will get early notices when new
[SPEAKER_00]: things are released alright that's the
main chatter for the top of the show let's
[SPEAKER_00]: move our way into the main topics I did
say I was going to talk about some emails
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of great emails here in
front of me I don't have them in any
[SPEAKER_00]: particular order just gonna grab one right
off the top of the stack this one comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from our friend Adam and it goes a lot
like this it says hey Rasta Jeff I like it
[SPEAKER_00]: when they start off like that says I
apologize in advance if this email gets a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit long it's kind of long but I will edit
it to the best of my ability and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: will get right to the point in answering a
good question it says I will try to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure to keep it as short and to the point
as possible first off my name is Adam and
[SPEAKER_00]: if this makes it to the podcast you can
use my name what's up Adam good to meet
[SPEAKER_00]: you I'm Rasta Jeff thank you for the great
message it goes on it says I listen to a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of podcasts about growing and I am a
patron to several of them they we do all
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate that then it says he's
wondering why doesn't contribute to mine
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah bro why don't you not a big deal I'm
doing just fine keep supporting the shows
[SPEAKER_00]: which you are supporting there are a lot
of people out there supporting me right
[SPEAKER_00]: now I'm very grateful and appreciative for
them I know that money is expensive so do
[SPEAKER_00]: what you can I'm getting enough support
there's probably somewhere else if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not supporting me and you are supporting
somebody that's fine that's what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to say somebody else need your
support that's cool it goes on it says
[SPEAKER_00]: you're the only podcast that I actually
trust to teach me something useful useful
[SPEAKER_00]: advice that I know if I do what you say
word-for-word I will be successful so
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you for the amazing enlightening
content dude that's a huge compliment I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know if you realize how much of a
compliment that is I do try to keep in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind that you're going to follow my word
hopefully step by step word-for-word when
[SPEAKER_00]: I give instructions I forget how much
trust you put in me how much faith you
[SPEAKER_00]: have in me I try to keep that in mind but
I try also not to let it affect me I just
[SPEAKER_00]: try to deliver the show I try not to let
it get too stressful and too heavy because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gonna freak me out and mess it all up
so I'm glad that you are noticing the the
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to detail and I'm glad that you
feel that you can just trust me and follow
[SPEAKER_00]: along and that things are gonna go right
just by following my guidance I appreciate
[SPEAKER_00]: that man thank you and I'm glad that I'm
making your garden better excuse the
[SPEAKER_00]: throat clearing I did take some fat fat
dabs a moment ago this will go away all
[SPEAKER_00]: right got to keep reading it says where
were we it says useful advice then it says
[SPEAKER_00]: that being said I have a different
breeding question for you we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: talking a lot about breeding on the
podcast lately I've really been enjoying
[SPEAKER_00]: these breeding questions so this one is a
fun question for me it goes on it says
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned enough from you to do my own
breeding I've been making my own seeds for
[SPEAKER_00]: years I do appreciate that you feel like
you've learned enough from me about
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding I hope you're reading some other
books read some Mel Frank some Greg Green
[SPEAKER_00]: there are lots of other breeding books a
lot of other breeding books that I would
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend you read learn about Mendel
charts read everything from Gregor Mendel
[SPEAKER_00]: learn about alial charts learn all of that
stuff then when it actually comes time to
[SPEAKER_00]: breed forget you learned all of that and
do it all from intuition but I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: important to learn all of that it goes on
there's more I have been breeding and
[SPEAKER_00]: making my own seeds for years I've been
managed to do pheno hunting testing and
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination which is hard for me to
actually express this question I have okay
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna do my best to filter out your
question it says every time I've run
[SPEAKER_00]: across I don't get a lot of seeds maybe a
fit maybe 50 to 100 seeds that's okay
[SPEAKER_00]: that's enough seeds to work with to play
with to learn a lot of things about those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and you just need possibly bigger
plants and better timed pollination which
[SPEAKER_00]: we can talk about later if you want to it
says you seem to be a very smart
[SPEAKER_00]: businessman so I guess my question is how
would one go about starting a seed company
[SPEAKER_00]: that is a very deep and detailed question
that I could talk for days about so I will
[SPEAKER_00]: touch on that and we'll try to get all of
your points here covered one of the main
[SPEAKER_00]: questions he asks is how do you keep
genetics around I mean I don't really care
[SPEAKER_00]: about plant counts but I have to do
phenohunts and make sure I still have meds
[SPEAKER_00]: to get by yeah that's the hard part is
being a breeder making seeds and also
[SPEAKER_00]: having enough non seeded medicine to
supply yourself that's kind of when I
[SPEAKER_00]: started transitioning from doing seeds to
not seeds that was something I would
[SPEAKER_00]: struggle with if you're not producing
seeds on a commercial level yet your small
[SPEAKER_00]: grow space if you make a little bit your
it doesn't sound like you're getting a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of seeds now if we improve the size of the
plants the pollination times we can
[SPEAKER_00]: produce many many more seeds in your grow
space whatever space you're using for your
[SPEAKER_00]: personal production we can dedicate one
crop per year in that space to make enough
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds for a long time for you to work with
and play with maybe enough to send out
[SPEAKER_00]: some testers to see if what you've
developed is if it qualifies for the
[SPEAKER_00]: market so you can make a lot of seeds I
would I would just dedicate one crop to
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds per year if that's what you've got
to do just go in there and pollinate one
[SPEAKER_00]: time and then clean it all up and then
grow a bunch of meds for the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: year hopefully then we got to teach you
some tricks to make the other crops fill
[SPEAKER_00]: in the gap for that one crop that you took
out for that part of the year that's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably another good thing to learn so
we've just got to pollinate one crop and
[SPEAKER_00]: then recover for that one crop that you
didn't grow for your medicine just means
[SPEAKER_00]: we got to increase production by whatever
that one crop is we got to cover that by
[SPEAKER_00]: the next four or five crops over the year
you understand what I'm saying so how do I
[SPEAKER_00]: have enough uh pollinate pollinate plants
and still have meds to get by it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: about finding more space you said you
don't care about plant counts so more
[SPEAKER_00]: space more lights more plants dude but try
to keep the best you can keep that pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: away from your non-seeded stuff just learn
how to have veg and flower cycles off of
[SPEAKER_00]: each other out of rhythm so you don't have
plant uh room a and flower while room b is
[SPEAKER_00]: in flowers you could pollinate finish up
and then flower the other room right away
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have them going and flower at the
same time and you won't pollinate both
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms I do apologize for all the throat
clearing in this episode it is quite
[SPEAKER_00]: distracting but I'm gonna kind of a flow
so we're gonna keep going here one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other questions how do you keep genetics
around I keep mother plants just like a
[SPEAKER_00]: basic mother plant I do have male and
female plants I've got the King Solomon
[SPEAKER_00]: male plant I've got the Jack the Ripper
male plant that I keep around big ups to
[SPEAKER_00]: sub cool shout out miss you buddy rest in
peace big love but I keep those plants
[SPEAKER_00]: just like a mother plant they veg
perpetually I keep them in a large pot
[SPEAKER_00]: under under a long light time cycle they
stay under a 19 five cycle honestly I keep
[SPEAKER_00]: my mom's under 19 five so they're on for
19 hours a day off for five hours a day I
[SPEAKER_00]: keep them under really powerful LED lights
right now actually they're under Canon
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs big up to black sale market check out
black sale market and I think you can use
[SPEAKER_00]: coupon code Rasta Jeff might save you a
few bucks anyway I keep the mother plants
[SPEAKER_00]: the father plants just in a perpetual
vegetative state and then when I need them
[SPEAKER_00]: for breeding or whatever I'm gonna do in
the room I just cut a bunch of clones and
[SPEAKER_00]: then veg those out and put those in the
room together and let them have a party
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's how the breeding happens
occasionally every depending on the strain
[SPEAKER_00]: and the plant and the vigor of the plant
and how much light that plant needs and
[SPEAKER_00]: how many clones of that plant I take how
frequently sometimes I do what I call re
[SPEAKER_00]: momming a plant every three six nine
months like let's say strawberry starburst
[SPEAKER_00]: let's talk about momming strawberry
starburst that plant grows very fast very
[SPEAKER_00]: vigorous it's one of my most productive
plants it needs to be remombed about every
[SPEAKER_00]: three to six months which means the pot
which is it which it is in it becomes root
[SPEAKER_00]: bound if I put it in a five or a seven I
don't have room for any bigger than a
[SPEAKER_00]: seven if I put it in a five or a seven it
will become root bound in three to six
[SPEAKER_00]: months very tightly root bound so it gets
slow it stops producing enough shoots it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets kind of sad and shitty looking I've
got to cut a bunch of clones off of it
[SPEAKER_00]: before it gets to that point ideally and
then either flower out that old one
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors or just toss that big one or
something and then use all those fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: clones they will be part of them will be a
production run and then one of them will
[SPEAKER_00]: be kept behind as the new mother so that
one gets remombed every probably every
[SPEAKER_00]: four or five months honestly about every
four months let's talk about remomming the
[SPEAKER_00]: Mac the Mac veg is quite slowly she
doesn't give me a lot of clones so I've
[SPEAKER_00]: vegged that one in a smaller pot and just
let it veg for a really long time I top it
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I take that top and I make
another plant out of it and I let it grow
[SPEAKER_00]: right next to the other one and then when
I need clones I actually cut clones off of
[SPEAKER_00]: both of those so that I've got enough
clones for my project with the Mac because
[SPEAKER_00]: I need extra cuts because it doesn't grow
very well but I use two plants as clone
[SPEAKER_00]: donors for that because it doesn't give me
a lot of cuts I don't have to remom the
[SPEAKER_00]: Mac every every six months every eight
months nine months or something like that
[SPEAKER_00]: because the roots don't go too crazy in
that plant it grows very slowly so I just
[SPEAKER_00]: keep that one aside and let it keep
vegging all the others get up potted that
[SPEAKER_00]: one doesn't get up potted I cut a clone
off of it grow it up cut a clone off of
[SPEAKER_00]: that grow that one up so I've got like
three or four small Mac plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: growing and get clones off of all of them
when it's time to use them keep one behind
[SPEAKER_00]: is the keeper plant I think I've described
keeping mother and father plants properly
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is how I keep genetics around
mother them father them perpetually veg
[SPEAKER_00]: them and then when they're getting too big
cut clones off them and start over a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of times I try to time it right to where I
can go from the three gallon to either the
[SPEAKER_00]: five or the seven get clones off of it
move that into the flower room and then
[SPEAKER_00]: keep the clones I just cut as my new
mother so I can keep it going forever so
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm vegging using my mom plant as my new
flowering plant get a clone off of that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of keeps it going that way you'll
learn a rhythm of how to do that all right
[SPEAKER_00]: so you said you don't really care about
plant count that is fun because the next
[SPEAKER_00]: thing you said is phenol hunts if you're
going to start a seed company you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have to search out a lot of things
you've got breeding stuff right how do you
[SPEAKER_00]: know it's any good you need to do some
feed need to do some phenol hunts run a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of those seeds see what you've got
pick one or two lines you said you've read
[SPEAKER_00]: a few things pick one or two of your
favorites run as many of them as you think
[SPEAKER_00]: you can manage do them small they don't
need to be big pots put them in a one
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon pot put them in a two gallon pot
veg them until they're just starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: show their shape what they're gonna be
shaped like then flower them out now you
[SPEAKER_00]: know what you've got you can see if it's
crap or if it's amazing or if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere in the middle you can see if
it's mutants if it's intersex you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're working with now now pick a
bunch of those seeds out package them up
[SPEAKER_00]: and send them out to testers let them grow
them do that do the testers experience
[SPEAKER_00]: positive or negative results with those
seeds that's how you're gonna find out if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got good stuff so phenol hunting is
gonna be a fun project especially when you
[SPEAKER_00]: said you're not worried about plant counts
get good at identifying the traits you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for get good at identifying
desirable traits what is the product what
[SPEAKER_00]: does the market want i don't follow trends
like right now everybody wants uh and no
[SPEAKER_00]: offense to the market that's just not
where i'm headed people want uh cake and
[SPEAKER_00]: dessert flavored stuff right now that
seems to be the trend i don't do that but
[SPEAKER_00]: what i do is i watch and see like what are
they after is it bud what of my stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: works they want bud density they want
flavor what is working is it uh powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew resistant what are the things
people are after for their grow right now
[SPEAKER_00]: and then i just make sure my stuff has
those traits and then if they like my
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors and aromas that's what they're
gonna buy it for so i should get myself
[SPEAKER_00]: back on track and jump back into the
message here it does say but king solomon
[SPEAKER_00]: for example how do you keep that genetic
around for so long i think i talked a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit about that just keep it as a
mother plant grow it cut clones off of it
[SPEAKER_00]: use the clones uh put the big one in the
room let him make pollen then i've got
[SPEAKER_00]: clones kept behind um it says i had a
beautiful arise meal that i just collected
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen from but now he is gone uh yeah you
could have taken clones from him just like
[SPEAKER_00]: you do a female plant and then you would
have had him around and then you could
[SPEAKER_00]: have done it again and again and again
then it goes on to say i hope you can kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of figure out what i'm asking because i
cannot figure out how to put it into words
[SPEAKER_00]: thanks for any advice and any response you
may give and thank you again for all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the amazing content you share with the
world and of course happy growing hey my
[SPEAKER_00]: friend adam thank you i do have a few more
notes to talk about on this i just wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure to cover the few questions
that you did specifically ask so um you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to start a seed company we talked
about how to keep the plants around how to
[SPEAKER_00]: make a few more seeds you don't care about
plant counts so phenol hunting is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be great get testers out you still got to
produce your own medicine just maybe use
[SPEAKER_00]: one room over there for meds and one room
over there for seeds and just make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: not to get pollen over there or time them
just veg this one flower this one at the
[SPEAKER_00]: right time you won't pollinate both rooms
i covered that now let's talk about some
[SPEAKER_00]: other stuff starting a seed company my
number one question i like to ask people
[SPEAKER_00]: when they have any idea is why why do you
want to start a seed company and i'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: doubting you i'm not disrespecting you i
just want you to say out loud to the world
[SPEAKER_00]: why do you want to start a seed company
there doesn't have to be any witnesses
[SPEAKER_00]: around nobody needs to be in the room when
you say it i just want you to hear the
[SPEAKER_00]: words come out of your mouth and
understand why you want to start a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: company have you thought about in depth
why so a lot of times when i say why
[SPEAKER_00]: people go because and they got to actually
think about it like they have to take like
[SPEAKER_00]: we get cool ideas i want to do a lot of
things i want to go places and i want to
[SPEAKER_00]: see people and buy things but why i don't
know do i just want to because i saw it on
[SPEAKER_00]: the internet do i just want to because it
sounds like a fun idea or is it something
[SPEAKER_00]: i really want to do do i think i want to
do it or do i want to do it so why do you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to start a seed company what's your
goal what's your purpose what's your
[SPEAKER_00]: mission what are you going to bring to the
industry the cannabis industry the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: industry what are you going to provide
that is not already here what are you
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do that's not already being done
what can you offer us that's not already
[SPEAKER_00]: being offered how are you going to stand
out what is your mission your purpose
[SPEAKER_00]: what's your pride where's your passion why
are you doing this what's your purpose all
[SPEAKER_00]: right so that's my main question all right
another note that i wrote down was to not
[SPEAKER_00]: learn how to be a seed breeder while
you're starting a company learn seed
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding learn the ins and outs of seed
breeding learn the basics before you
[SPEAKER_00]: launch your company if you put your brand
and your logo on some stuff and you send
[SPEAKER_00]: out some stuff before you're ready and you
realize i don't know all of the ins and
[SPEAKER_00]: outs and i haven't thought this through
yet and you send out some problematic
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds or your shipping isn't on time or
things go wrong and you start off wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: you won't get far in this industry the
cannabis industry the seed breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: industry the growers the patients they're
all on the internet they all have a very
[SPEAKER_00]: tight-knit community everybody knows
everybody every brand gets a very quick
[SPEAKER_00]: reputation if you kind of suck at the
beginning the community is going to say
[SPEAKER_00]: hey this new seed company they fail at the
very beginning they didn't do me right
[SPEAKER_00]: they didn't treat me right their product
wasn't good it didn't work for me you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: never get very far after that because word
spreads like wildfire and this industry we
[SPEAKER_00]: do take people's word for a lot of what
we're doing we use a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations and a lot of reviews from
the internet so that's going to matter a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot so don't learn on your customers get a
established learn what you're doing then
[SPEAKER_00]: get a customer base that's going to go a
long way for you because i see a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders on social media doing it
backwards they're making seeds and trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to figure it out and using their customers
as their tester base and as their their
[SPEAKER_00]: education don't do that educate yourself
then sell seeds to your customers and
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll be much more happy with you you'll
feel more pride and then they'll you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: stick around and they'll come back and buy
more seeds i've got a lot of stuff on my
[SPEAKER_00]: paper here if you're going to start a seed
company oh something i was going to say
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers are very educated consumers are
very connected and they are not afraid to
[SPEAKER_00]: go on the internet and either give you big
praise you can see like like you said here
[SPEAKER_00]: ross and jeff you did amazingly there's
also the opposite if you don't do well
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll get the great thing about the
internet if you do a good job you'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: one email if you do a bad job you get
about a hundred of them so if you mess up
[SPEAKER_00]: they're gonna there you're gonna get lit
up really quickly and the consumers are
[SPEAKER_00]: very very educated right now they could
listen to my show they could listen to the
[SPEAKER_00]: dude grow show they could listen to adam
dunn they can listen to tad hussy they can
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to danny denko and mike they can
listen to so many shows out there to
[SPEAKER_00]: become very educated consumers and then
they all go online they join my discord
[SPEAKER_00]: they join everybody's discord every
breeder out there by now probably has a
[SPEAKER_00]: cool discord and they all go get very very
educated and they talk amongst each other
[SPEAKER_00]: we love teaching each other we're all very
passionate so the consumers are very
[SPEAKER_00]: educated right now and if you make some
mistakes they will see through it and
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll call you out they'll point it out
they'll expose you is what the internet
[SPEAKER_00]: likes to say now so yeah do what you're
gonna do but do it correctly come correct
[SPEAKER_00]: is what i think they say now because the
consumers are very educated if you are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to start a seed company from
somebody who has been in it for a while
[SPEAKER_00]: who is deep in it now this is my life dude
i there's no way out and that's cool i am
[SPEAKER_00]: dedicated this is what i wanted i didn't
know this is what i was starting when i
[SPEAKER_00]: started it but this is what i want um
there's no halfway in if you're starting a
[SPEAKER_00]: seed company if you're all in you're all
in if you're not all in you know it and
[SPEAKER_00]: don't even start if you've got a backup
plan if you say i'm gonna start this seed
[SPEAKER_00]: company but if it fails you're already not
in it you've got to say i'm gonna start
[SPEAKER_00]: this seed company and then i'm gonna do
this with the seed company and then in
[SPEAKER_00]: five years i'll do this then in 10 years
i'll do this then we'll expand to this if
[SPEAKER_00]: that's your thought process you've got a
chance of winning if you've got a backup
[SPEAKER_00]: plan already if you've got an exit
strategy you are not meant to be in the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed game this is a huge commitment this
is a huge lifestyle this isn't just a
[SPEAKER_00]: business this isn't just um it's not just
work this is my lifestyle i have to wake
[SPEAKER_00]: up and take care of plants before i go to
bed i am checking on plants i spend the
[SPEAKER_00]: first part of my day answering emails i
know people are going no he doesn't he
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't reply to me dude i try i get a lot
of emails there's social media to be done
[SPEAKER_00]: there's merchandise to be ordered there's
packaging to be ordered once the packaging
[SPEAKER_00]: gets here you got to put the seeds in the
packaging you got to put the labels on the
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging i do all of that stuff i do get
some help with some of the things i like
[SPEAKER_00]: to do all the seed touching and stuff
myself some of the other stuff i do let
[SPEAKER_00]: some people help with but 99 percent of it
is me there's a web guide there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: accounting team there's stuff oh then you
got to go talk to the lawyer you got to go
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to the accountants you got to go do
bank stuff there's so much being involved
[SPEAKER_00]: so if you want to do this uh be all in it
will be stressful in so many ways but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: rewarding in so many ways i wake up and i
don't have to answer to a boss the boss is
[SPEAKER_00]: myself and the most i and i'm okay with
that that's what i want for my life
[SPEAKER_00]: there's nobody bitching at me nobody
telling me i'm late nobody telling me that
[SPEAKER_00]: i suck that i got to work harder uh only
me i'm the only one that says that to me
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's okay um but it's it's a
lifestyle it's a strain on relationships
[SPEAKER_00]: because uh when you own a business it's
hard to decide when to take a day off you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys don't even want to know what time it
is right now when i'm recording it's
[SPEAKER_00]: darkest shit out i'm the only one up in
the neighborhood everybody can probably
[SPEAKER_00]: hear me talking right now but that is
entrepreneur life if you're going to start
[SPEAKER_00]: a seed company you become an entrepreneur
you're you're breeding you're taking care
[SPEAKER_00]: of the garden you're taking care of the
seeds then you're marketing you're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: merchandise you're meeting with people
you're worried about security you're
[SPEAKER_00]: worried about financial things uh then
you're marketing again then there's social
[SPEAKER_00]: media then you got to get up and do it all
again tomorrow when do you take a break
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to put a strain on
relationships it's going to put a strain
[SPEAKER_00]: on a lot of things you have to learn a lot
of balance uh but if you love it like i do
[SPEAKER_00]: uh it's very very rewarding i think that
the interactions i've built with my
[SPEAKER_00]: audience the iri army uh that grow from
your heart crew uh that is very rewarding
[SPEAKER_00]: that refills all of the stress that this
company gives me it's not even that
[SPEAKER_00]: stressful it's just it's it could be so
much more stressful but the the things i
[SPEAKER_00]: have to handle the army the crew replenish
me i go hang out in the chat i hang out on
[SPEAKER_00]: monday and you guys uh give me praise and
send me digital fist bumps that stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: really does recharge me of course the
patreon and the seed sales they do feel
[SPEAKER_00]: good as well but all that stuff from the
crowd the army does recharge me so there
[SPEAKER_00]: is a lot of work to be done it's going to
put a strain on your life your
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships don't let it affect your
health learn some balance so if you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: an exit strategy you're not in you got to
be all in because uh this is an all-in
[SPEAKER_00]: thing and it's getting very competitive
every year it gets more competitive
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking of every year i didn't think
about uh going to events once you've
[SPEAKER_00]: started a seed brand where are you going
to sell your seeds it's great to sell them
[SPEAKER_00]: on the internet that feels really nice but
the key is to go to the places and meet
[SPEAKER_00]: the people and shake their hands that's
where you build relationships that's where
[SPEAKER_00]: you build long-lasting clientele some of
my favorite people i meet at the events
[SPEAKER_00]: they stand in front of my booth and wait
30 minutes to get in line to see me and
[SPEAKER_00]: shake my hand but when they get there i
take my time with them i shake their hand
[SPEAKER_00]: i look them in the eye and i'm like bro i
saw the pictures of the last girl you did
[SPEAKER_00]: it looked amazing uh your new baby is
beautiful like conversations like that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know who you are bro and ma'am uh but uh
yeah i like to meet the people shake their
[SPEAKER_00]: hands give them hugs high five them take
pictures with them that's a huge huge part
[SPEAKER_00]: of being a seed breeder you got to build a
booth you have to build a team that can
[SPEAKER_00]: work the booth with you very well then
while you're at the booth at the endo expo
[SPEAKER_00]: for the weekend who's taking care of the
garden at home who's taking care of the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds who's taking care of the internet
the website the orders there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: things to think about logistics to deal
with when it comes to owning a legitimate
[SPEAKER_00]: seed company but if you build a nice team
and you got some support it is very easy
[SPEAKER_00]: um the market is getting more competitive
the market is getting much more
[SPEAKER_00]: competitive and more fast pace all of the
websites where i vend if they had 10
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders when i started now they've got 30
if they had 20 when i started now they've
[SPEAKER_00]: got 100 these websites are building
quickly of course i'm expanding to more
[SPEAKER_00]: vendors i've got more outlets but every
website i go to they have got more and
[SPEAKER_00]: more breeders which is more competition
which means that you've got to do what i
[SPEAKER_00]: said earlier how do you stand out how do
you set apart what makes you special why
[SPEAKER_00]: do i want to buy your seeds why would i
pick your brand over the 700 other brands
[SPEAKER_00]: that are available on the market right now
so you're gonna have to come up somehow
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna have to stand out you're
gonna have to win some awards or put out a
[SPEAKER_00]: strain that gets noticed if you want
longevity do something real don't just use
[SPEAKER_00]: some shitty sales tactics that a lot of
other brands that came and went tried to
[SPEAKER_00]: use all right there's more there is more
no backup plan that's what i've got
[SPEAKER_00]: written if you got a backup plan you're
not in it to win it uh one of the things i
[SPEAKER_00]: struggled with and i keep kind of
mentioning this letting others help with
[SPEAKER_00]: my company is really hard for me i do have
a web guy because i have no idea what i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: doing when it comes to building a website
i rely on him and trust him greatly i've
[SPEAKER_00]: got a graphic design group i've got a few
people that do graphic designs for me
[SPEAKER_00]: they've learned my style i got one guy i
can say hey bro i want to make a sticker
[SPEAKER_00]: for a strain called blue raspberry truffle
and he goes say no more fam and 30 minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: later i get a design for blue raspberry
truffle and it's what i was thinking i
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have to send him my image or my
idea he goes i already know what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna do bro here you go and he just sends
it it's perfect so uh shout out to kevin
[SPEAKER_00]: you know who you are bro uh he hooks me up
with great art i do stuff like that i let
[SPEAKER_00]: people help me out with stuff like that
but letting people uh design some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: merch and do some of that kind of stuff it
took me a minute to let go of some of that
[SPEAKER_00]: control i still don't let anybody package
seeds every seed is packaged by hand by me
[SPEAKER_00]: they come in a little round disc with a
little foam protective insert all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds come out of a little uh it's a
ritual they get put into a little like a
[SPEAKER_00]: just a cereal bowl a small cereal bowl i
roll them on the bottom of the bowl to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure they're nice and hard with this
finger i make sure the seeds nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: solid i set a few of them at the edge of
the bowl and then i try to find 10 or 12
[SPEAKER_00]: of them that look like they would be
friends to go in a container together
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe that's crazy but i package every
seed by myself they're irie genetics hand
[SPEAKER_00]: selected premium seeds and i think that
doing that it says it on the package
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what i talk about i need to follow
that and that's why i stand out because i
[SPEAKER_00]: touched those seeds and i made sure that
they're quality i don't trust anybody else
[SPEAKER_00]: to do that learning to learning to
delegate and letting anybody do anything
[SPEAKER_00]: else with my company took a long time it
took a very long time until i realized i
[SPEAKER_00]: simply cannot do all of this stuff if i
want to give you a long talkative podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: like this i've been going for quite a
while today and i'm enjoying it i want to
[SPEAKER_00]: give you long shows like this i've got to
learn how to let other people help me with
[SPEAKER_00]: other things so shout out to guys like
dave dave does uh waffles and actions if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're on the internet you know what
waffles and actions are uh shout out to
[SPEAKER_00]: the artist crew uh shout out to handmade
apparel adam hand for making uh shirts for
[SPEAKER_00]: me shout out to kevin for doing artwork uh
there are other people uh black thumb
[SPEAKER_00]: grower gets a shout out too but those
people helped me out quite a bit i feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like there was somebody i really wanted to
give a shout i was going to give a shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out to uh dp 710 for his blueberry butcher
artwork you guys will see stickers and
[SPEAKER_00]: shirts of that when the seeds are
restocked uh shout out to dave for helping
[SPEAKER_00]: design some merchandise uh shout out to
all the people that helped me out other
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to uh riven waters for a bunch
of great artwork as well uh that those
[SPEAKER_00]: people make my life much easier a lot of
people have sent me great artwork now i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: in a hole i can't remember everybody but
all those people that send me artwork and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that that help me out they do
make my life easier it was hard hard hard
[SPEAKER_00]: hard to let people have a little bit of
control in this company because it was my
[SPEAKER_00]: vision it's my baby so learn how to
delegate learn what you're comfortable
[SPEAKER_00]: letting other people do so once the seeds
go into the container and that part is
[SPEAKER_00]: sealed up sometimes i do let other people
fold the card and put a sticker on it and
[SPEAKER_00]: put that into a baggie and heat seal it
but that's like the only part i really let
[SPEAKER_00]: other people do for me because that's kind
of i can watch them do it and i give them
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 packs 100 bubbles with 100 cards and
100 stickers and they kind of can't screw
[SPEAKER_00]: it up they kind of have to try to fuck
that up so i do let other people do that
[SPEAKER_00]: part sometimes but most of the time it's
just me doing the seed packaging so
[SPEAKER_00]: learning to let other people help is a
challenge know when to ask for help so
[SPEAKER_00]: then you've got to just do it man just do
it and then learn how to adjust and adapt
[SPEAKER_00]: to the market things are going to happen
things are going to go wrong things won't
[SPEAKER_00]: go as expected i've been booked for events
and had the car loaded up and was about to
[SPEAKER_00]: get in the car and then got an email or a
text message saying hey they just came and
[SPEAKER_00]: said you can't sell seeds here and i'm
like well i paid you a lot of money for
[SPEAKER_00]: that booth and i'd like to go sell seeds
there and they're like no you can't even
[SPEAKER_00]: sell seeds i wouldn't even show up if i
were you i'll give you back your money or
[SPEAKER_00]: or you might not even get your money back
those are often options at events so learn
[SPEAKER_00]: to adjust and adapt recently my instagram
page got fucking taken luckily i've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: good team we got that back quite quickly
but that's a great marketing tool and
[SPEAKER_00]: without that i was not reaching over 30
000 people when i post over 500 people
[SPEAKER_00]: would see my stories every time i post
them that was 500 people that were not
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing my content potential those are we
call those leads in the business industry
[SPEAKER_00]: so it took a minute to get the instagram
back there's always going to be stepping
[SPEAKER_00]: stones and stuff like that learn to adjust
and adapt shit's not going to go smoothly
[SPEAKER_00]: for the first two years and then you're
going to get busy and it's going to feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like you're never going to catch up which
is a good thing if you feel like you're
[SPEAKER_00]: catching up in a business that means you
don't have enough to do it means you're
[SPEAKER_00]: failing you got to find more shit to do so
i'm rambling on that let's see then
[SPEAKER_00]: there's marketing networking and being
involved you've got to market your brand
[SPEAKER_00]: how are people going to know that you
exist social media will get you so far but
[SPEAKER_00]: then you've got to get out there be seen
make flyers merchandise stickers be on
[SPEAKER_00]: shows get known networking um when you're
new i'm not trying to it's hard to afford
[SPEAKER_00]: a booth and advertising and all of the
requirements to get up where you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: be as a new breeder so networking will
help you out maybe you'll make friends
[SPEAKER_00]: with myself or another breeder who is new
to the game maybe i'll say hey bro i'll
[SPEAKER_00]: give you two hours at my booth on sunday
if you want to come hang out at my booth
[SPEAKER_00]: on sunday i'll give you two hours where
you can come set up shop at my booth you
[SPEAKER_00]: can tweet and say hey my brand will be at
i read genetics's booth at the endo expo
[SPEAKER_00]: for two hours you can sit next to me and
sell seeds for two hours i'll give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: chance like that so do some networking and
make some friends or find another breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: who is right at your level and split the
booth with them or maybe two or three
[SPEAKER_00]: other breeders and get like four or five
other breeders who are just entering the
[SPEAKER_00]: game all of you can go and network
together you can all use your social media
[SPEAKER_00]: powers together power and numbers more
people will come to the booth uh then when
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody comes to the booth to buy your
friend's seeds they'll say oh you made a
[SPEAKER_00]: cross of that and that i want those seeds
also and now you've made a new client a
[SPEAKER_00]: new customer a new lead and then you cross
advertise with each other like that i
[SPEAKER_00]: don't feel competition in the breeding
game so i'm all about teaching my friends
[SPEAKER_00]: how to get into this and helping you do it
just know uh it's oversaturated and a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of us are uh it's already taken up dude
the the pie is already getting eaten up
[SPEAKER_00]: but i'm not afraid to teach you guys how
to get into it because i feel it's like um
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like food and music i make a certain
kind of thing and you might not be into my
[SPEAKER_00]: certain kind of thing and that is okay
with me because there are plenty of people
[SPEAKER_00]: that are into it i'm into fish the band
fish and i'm into the grateful dead and i
[SPEAKER_00]: love reggae music that's my little box my
genre of stuff i really really enjoy so
[SPEAKER_00]: let's just hypothetically say that my
seeds are that kind of music we'll say i
[SPEAKER_00]: put out fish and reggae and grateful dead
vibes with my seeds if you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: norwegian death metal seeds that's not
going to be my favorite i'm not against it
[SPEAKER_00]: i got no problem with it that's just not
my favorite but there's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody at the convention that is looking
and has been looking their whole life for
[SPEAKER_00]: norwegian death metal seeds maybe you're
into country music there's a breeder that
[SPEAKER_00]: breeds seeds that are aimed toward the
country music vibe i'm just being um just
[SPEAKER_00]: giving you analogies here trying to
compare some shit but i don't feel in any
[SPEAKER_00]: competition because i make a certain type
of product and other breeders out there
[SPEAKER_00]: make a certain type of product and a lot
of the times uh people in the community
[SPEAKER_00]: have already decided what they're into if
you're into a certain thing like if a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people have already decided when they
go to the event i want to go find mr soul
[SPEAKER_00]: or i want to go find i read genetics or i
want to go find cap you later everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: goes and gets in caps line so we already
know we've already kind of found the band
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're looking for it's like when you
go to the festival can't wait for six o
[SPEAKER_00]: 'clock i got to go see fish at the main
stage or whatever band you're into you
[SPEAKER_00]: already know what the industry gets like
that i feel no competition no uh no weird
[SPEAKER_00]: vibes or anything like that toward any of
the industry so i think i covered most of
[SPEAKER_00]: my notes i did write a lot of stuff down
that was a really good question got me
[SPEAKER_00]: really really rambly which i do enjoy i do
need a drink and i do think that i'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to wrap up this episode because my next
question is going to be a long one so on
[SPEAKER_00]: the next episode we're going to have
another long question that talks about

commercial cultivations in the next
[SPEAKER_00]: episode uh my buddy adam thank you that
