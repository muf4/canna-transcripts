[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I feel like we've covered all of
the business part of today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today's podcast, let's segue into
something a little bit more fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've been watching the last couple of
episodes, I've definitely noticed it while
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been editing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a few people have noticed it enough to
send in a message and say, Hey Rasta Jeff,
[SPEAKER_02]: what has happened to the bridge of your
nose?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may notice I've got a little dinger
here on the bridge of my nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been there for a couple of shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing crazy happened to my nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was invited to a virtual star walk,
a non VR interactive experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went to that experience and they
promised us through all the advertising
[SPEAKER_02]: through the ticket purchase that it was
not VR.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we got there, the first thing they
did was put the VR helmet on me and tell
[SPEAKER_02]: me it's not VR.
[SPEAKER_02]: They say it wasn't VR because it was a
screen and I could see the rest of the
[SPEAKER_02]: room, but it was basically putting on VR.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I'm bitching about the wrong
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The person that placed the VR helmet on my
head was an average size person and I am
[SPEAKER_02]: six foot five.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she reached up and tried to gently
place this VR helmet on my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when she let go of it, it smacked me
right square in the fucking nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made my eyes water a little bit,
gave me a little bit of a dinger.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it wasn't anything real exciting that
happened to my nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to a non VR interactive star walk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they put on the VR goggles or the
VR helmet, they busted me right in the
[SPEAKER_02]: bridge of the nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really what happened to my nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you to all of the people who
said, Hey Rasta Jeff, what's going on with
[SPEAKER_02]: your face?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do appreciate your concern.
[SPEAKER_02]: My nose will be just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did hurt for a little bit, but I am over
it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for your care and concern.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that we've got my nose out of the way,
let's move into a new section that we've
[SPEAKER_02]: been doing here on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a section that I call grow room
pet peeves.
[SPEAKER_02]: A few weeks ago, I mentioned something
that really bugged me in a grow room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've invited you, the listeners,
the viewers to rant and vent a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: and let me know what drives you nuts in
the grow room.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is your grower pet peeve?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there something in your grow that
drives you crazy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there something you see in another grow
that drives you crazy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps you work in a commercial
cultivation facility and something just
[SPEAKER_02]: pisses you off there every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I encourage you to send me a message.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do it on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do it through an email.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can even use that grow help tab on
iregenetics.com, but send me your grow
[SPEAKER_02]: room pet peeves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me know what grinds your gears about
cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be about the cannabis community,
anything cannabis related that just
[SPEAKER_02]: frustrates you or like I said,
grinds your gears or is your grow room or
[SPEAKER_02]: grow culture pet peeve.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me know if I do share your grow pet
peeve here on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_02]: You will win a free coupon for a free pack
of iregenetics premium seeds at iredirect
[SPEAKER_02]: .com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right here in front of me, I do have a
grow room pet peeve.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one was sent in by my friend Newby
Nugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to my dude Newby Nugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend Newby Nugs, please send me your
email address so I can send you a coupon
[SPEAKER_02]: code for a free pack of iregenetics
premium seeds at iredirect.com because I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: about to read your pet peeve here on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that pet peeve goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, yes, my pet peeve is pictures of
dirty grow room floors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, if you're going to grow, clean up the
floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to take a picture,
clean up the floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to post that picture,
clean up the floor or at least edit out
[SPEAKER_02]: that dirty floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the main things to think about in
growing is cleanliness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cleanliness is how you prevent probably
70% of most of your major problems in the
[SPEAKER_02]: grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So clean that shit up off the floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: My dude Newby does have more though.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, pots on the floor with no drain
pans and runoff stains and build up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that is so gross, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to put pots on the floor
and water them, have something to catch
[SPEAKER_02]: that runoff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you got a floor drain and you're
doing a bunch and you got the commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: thing going, then that's a different
story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hose that down when you're done.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're growing in a home grow and
you're pouring water into a pot,
[SPEAKER_02]: have something to catch that water after
it goes through the pot, not just the
[SPEAKER_02]: floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then don't let those big nutrients,
those big salt rings build up on the
[SPEAKER_02]: floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just ugly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do that if you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I understand that that is a pet peeve.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd recommend not doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just be a little more, have a little
more pride for the grow room.
[SPEAKER_02]: My buddy does have more to say though.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, add a little soil and leaf for
garnish.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is why I read your message because I
like that tone.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just going to read it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says my pet peeve is pictures of dirty
floors, pots on the floor, no drain pans,
[SPEAKER_02]: runoff stains and build up and add a
little soil and leaf for garnish.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like you've just made a recipe
for disaster there, my bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are all pet peeves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean that shit up, especially if you're
going to post a photo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it does go on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says just lighting up the neon sign for
pests and pathogens and problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even worse is carpet in closet grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Carpet in a grow room does.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even know, but that's like nails
on a chalkboard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just reading that carpet in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't recommend it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand some of you guys have to do
what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to grow where you can grow,
but carpet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's such a great place for so many
bugs to hide.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're going to spill shit on
that carpet and ruin it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to get moldy and funky.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to get gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm feeling you newbie nugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: My dude, please reach out because I owe
you a free pack of iry genetics,
[SPEAKER_02]: premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Podcast world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's segue into the question and answer
part of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have a website.
[SPEAKER_02]: That website is irygenetics.com on the top
of that website.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a list of tabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of those tabs does say grow help or
grow questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot what it says.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't go there today and remember
myself, but go to the website.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a grow question, go to the
grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll ask you a couple of preliminary
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we give you space to type in your
grow question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Send me a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I read your grow question here on the
podcast, I will send you a coupon code for
[SPEAKER_02]: a free pack of seeds at irydirect.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a great question here in front of
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one came from my friend who wants to
be called all mixed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good to answer your question on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not look at the name before I pulled
this question out of the pile.
[SPEAKER_02]: I simply read the question and thought
this is something I could answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I do see the name on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend, I will be sending you a coupon
code for a free pack of irygenetics
[SPEAKER_02]: premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: The grow question goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, yo Rasta Jeff, what's up?
[SPEAKER_02]: All mixed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see you, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says I was wondering if potency would
go up if I let my cultivars go longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says I pulled lemon Jeffrey at day 65
and had my flower tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tested at 20.1% THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And 2% CBG.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is a sign that it could have gone
longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That CBG may have converted into more THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you let that go longer, you may be onto
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes on though.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says I was wondering if potency would
go up with more days in flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it that if I'm in organic soil and
not using PGRs to push the cultivars to
[SPEAKER_02]: their full potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks as always Rasta Jeff from your
friend all mixed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now a couple of things come to mind to
answer this question.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the first thing I want to talk about
is the trichome ripeness.
[SPEAKER_02]: The main thing that matters is the
ripeness of the trichomes of these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you use magnification to see how many
amber trichomes you had on this plant
[SPEAKER_02]: before harvest?
[SPEAKER_02]: My next question would be what percentage
of those trichomes were amber?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you have 10%, 20%, 30% amber
trichomes?
[SPEAKER_02]: How many of those trichomes were amber at
harvest time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we could experiment from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could cut some down earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could cut some at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cut some a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dry and cure them exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then have them lab tested again.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be cultivar specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be phenotype specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it all depends on the ripeness of that
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So going longer, it may have been more
potent in different cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: The THC in there may have converted to
something different.
[SPEAKER_02]: The CBG also may have had the opportunity,
the potential to convert into THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are many things that can happen in
just a few more days of growing that
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all about those trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were the trichomes ripe at harvest time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Were they at their peak ripeness?
[SPEAKER_02]: Could they have gone a little bit longer?
[SPEAKER_02]: Were they a little bit early?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's going to make the main
difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second thing I would think about is
the dry and cure process.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of your photography on social media is
impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know you're a skilled grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're a qualified photographer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But after the grow, I don't know what
happens after you take those photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you're able to dry and
cure properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not doubting you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying that also could be a
factor in increasing potency of those
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So keep in mind that the dry and cure
process can dramatically increase or
[SPEAKER_02]: decrease the potency of the overall
finished product.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you dry it too quickly, it may lose a
lot of the potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may lose a lot of the turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you dry it nice and slowly,
you should retain most of the turps and
[SPEAKER_02]: most of the potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: But many variables can mess that up very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the two things to think about are
harvesting at peak ripeness and the only
[SPEAKER_02]: way to really master that is by cutting
down at different times, really,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But are you really concerned what the lab
report says?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm more curious, what does it do when you
smoke it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you cut it down at the right time
according to your buzz, to your desires?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want more of a racy buzz,
cut it down a little bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want that middle buzz, cut it down
when you got about 20% amber trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want more of a sedative,
couchlock, relaxed sort of a buzz,
[SPEAKER_02]: then wait till you got 30% amber
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where you need to dial in your
desires.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I would do is I would grow three
or four plants and then I would cut one
[SPEAKER_02]: down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did you cut yours down?
[SPEAKER_02]: 65.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would cut one down at day 60,
then one at day 65 and one at day 70.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I would dry and cure them all the
same way, the best that you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I would send them to a lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then while you're waiting for the lab to
run their test and send you results,
[SPEAKER_02]: do your own independent testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take the plant that you cut down at day 60
and make it your first smoke of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you normally smoke a joint,
if you normally smoke a bong load,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you normally smoke out of the hookah,
however you normally do it, take your
[SPEAKER_02]: first smoke of the day of that plant that
you cut down at day 60 and then take notes
[SPEAKER_02]: of what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get cotton mouth?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get a nice buzz?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you enjoy it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it what you're looking for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the next day, then you could smoke
whatever weed you want after that
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the next day, take that plant you cut
down at day 65 and smoke that one the same
[SPEAKER_02]: exact way as you did yesterday for your
first smoke of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then let's take notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get cotton mouth?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you like the flavor?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the aroma?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get the buzz you're looking for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Then compare it to the one you smoked
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you can smoke whatever weed you want
for the rest of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I give you permission.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the third day, guess what we're going
to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to smoke the sample that went
for 70 days, and we're going to compare it
[SPEAKER_02]: on the same criteria as the first two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we're going to think about which one
did you really enjoy the most.
[SPEAKER_02]: Write it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pick one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Write the things that you notice.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pros, the cons, the pluses,
the minuses, the similarities,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark all that shit down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then when the tests come, compare the lab
tests to your personal paper notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you agree?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it your favorite?
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that is the most potent?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the one that you chose?
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that's the terpiest?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the one that you chose?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then see if those test results line
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is your favorite plant the one that got
you the highest?
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that gave you the favorite buzz?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the one that had the highest lab
test?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was the one that you said tasted the best?
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that tested with the highest
turbo?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just play a game and see if you can get
the lab test, if you can predict the lab
[SPEAKER_02]: test, or if the lab tests agree with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think that that would be fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: What matters the most is which finished
product do you prefer?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like the early cut, the middle cut,
that late cut?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the most important part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe you're growing for a medical need
for somebody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you're growing for a profit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does your medical client or does your
client tell?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they prefer a certain one?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's going to matter the most.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use that lab test for funsies.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like you're testing anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm always curious to see lab results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please do send me those.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the most important part is which one
do you like the most?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now he does wrap it up with, or is it that
I'm growing in organic soil and not using
[SPEAKER_02]: PGRs?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't think that that is a factor
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're a great grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're going to get similar
results in PGRs or in your organic soil or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever you chose to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure that you would kill it and
get similar results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't feel bad that 20% THC was your test
result.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a low number.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a bad number.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very common.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's acceptable in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you got that 2.0% CBG, which tells me
there could have been possibly more THC if
[SPEAKER_02]: you did let it go longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the only way to answer that is honestly
to let one go a little bit longer and then
[SPEAKER_02]: test it again and see what type of results
you do get.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to make that official, you have to do
everything the exact same all over again,
[SPEAKER_02]: or it's not an official science.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would run, like I said before,
run a few plants and then cut some down at
[SPEAKER_02]: some time, some at another, some at
another, and then run those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you could cut one branch off,
one branch, one branch.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds kind of silly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like that idea, but it would be
good science.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would do three more tests if you can
from a 60, a 65, and a 70.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want to go crazy, go for a day
75 test just for fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most importantly, though, smoke them.
[SPEAKER_02]: See what you like.
[SPEAKER_02]: My dude 3.11, I do thank you once again
for the great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one got me rambling quite well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to send you a coupon code for a
free pack of IRI genetics premium seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I can't wait to see what you do with
them, my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have another great message here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one came from our friend who wants to
be called Stacks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the question from Stacks goes a little
bit like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, yo, this podcast rocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of good info and has helped me in my
breeding journey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad to help you out in the breeding
journey.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, I'm sure you've spoke on this
before, but thoughts on selfing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So selfing, that is when you take a female
plant and you treat it with the solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that female plant will make pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: That pollen is feminized pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will take that pollen and put it on a
clone of the exact same plant that will
[SPEAKER_02]: make feminized seeds that are,
we'll just say golden goat is a golden
[SPEAKER_02]: goat to golden goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since that is the same plant, it
pollinated itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is now selfing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is an S1.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a selfed feminized plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is what selfing means.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to catch you guys up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then he goes on and he says, what about
the next generations, the S2, the S3,
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, I read on the internet that it's
the quickest way to uniformity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes those S2s and S3s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's talk about how we do that and
what that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: The S1 is when you take that original
plant and pollinate itself, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That first seed that comes off.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is S1.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I were to grow out those seeds and find
a plant that looked just like the moth,
[SPEAKER_02]: that I'm looking for, just like the
original plant that I reversed,
[SPEAKER_02]: that I'm working with, if I find that one
again, then I cut two clones of that and
[SPEAKER_02]: reverse one and pollinate the other one
again and do the process again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm making S2s.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I repeat that, I'm making S3.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time I do it, I make another
generation with another number.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes in those further S generations,
things can be great or they can be really,
[SPEAKER_02]: really wonky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you'll breed just weak,
slow growing plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you'll grow some mutated plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you'll bring out some weird
recessive traits, but sometimes you do
[SPEAKER_02]: have really good luck and you're able to
lock in the exact traits that you were
[SPEAKER_02]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have played with S2 and S3 generations
and a couple of back crosses and different
[SPEAKER_02]: variations of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from my experience, it's less risky to
just leave that S1 alone and be happy with
[SPEAKER_02]: the phenotypes that are coming from that
than it is to go S2 and risk the mutation
[SPEAKER_02]: and the weird lack of vigor and the
weirdness that does come from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there is more to this question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me jump to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, my thought is if I find the
perfect cross and an F1 generation,
[SPEAKER_02]: could I self that to get uniformity or are
there problems this way?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the F1 generation is not feminized.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if you meant F1 generation in
there, but we'll talk about a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: different things here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start with Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said find the perfect cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Golden Goat is a nearly perfect cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it breeds beautifully.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to use Golden Goat here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said, my thought is if I find the
perfect cross, which we'll say Golden
[SPEAKER_02]: Goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Golden Goat is an F1, so that fits
perfectly into your criteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, could I self that to get
uniformity or are there problems this way?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there are absolutely no problems in
selfing that F1.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a great idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is exactly what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do that with the Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do that with a couple of other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you self an F1, a lot of the times
what I do find is that I find
[SPEAKER_02]: approximately 50% to 70% of the progeny
look just like the original mother plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I take that Golden Goat,
I self it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I make Golden Goat S1 seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least 50% of those seeds are going to
look just like the Golden Goat that I
[SPEAKER_02]: started with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now here's a way that I like to break it
down when I'm talking about fem seeds and
[SPEAKER_02]: phenotypes to expect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the time in my experience and
believe me, there are many variables.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just from my experience and what I
have seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the time, I'm going to find 50% of
the phenotypes look just like the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: that I reversed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I'm working with Golden Goat,
50% to 70% we're going to say 50% for this
[SPEAKER_02]: just to give myself a buffer zone and just
for mathematical purposes, usually 50% to
[SPEAKER_02]: 70%, but we're going to say 50% of those
seeds are going to look just like the
[SPEAKER_02]: Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now what we're also going to find is 20%
of those seeds are going to look like the
[SPEAKER_02]: mother of Golden Goat and 20% of those
seeds will look like the dad of the Golden
Goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're also going to find about 10% of
those seeds just to be complete weirdos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows what those are going to look
like.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is just what the genetics do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could look like grandma.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could look like grandpa.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could be all over the place,
but usually about 50 to 70% of them are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to look just like the mom that we
started with.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to see some of the dad and
some of the mom on the parents,
[SPEAKER_02]: the mom and the dad, and then sometimes
we're going to see some weird phenotypes
[SPEAKER_02]: in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is generally the ratio that I find
when I'm working with the S1s,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a feminized version of the F1.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I understand that the question was
asking about going further generations to
[SPEAKER_02]: lock in that uniformity or the word
stability.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when stable comes in here,
but I think by doing the S1 that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to lock in as much as you need to.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to find enough phenotypes
that look just like the original mother
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're doing this for yourself for
preservation, that S1 is perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You will find a lot of great phenotypes in
there that look just like the mom.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to do this for commercial
production, if you want to put these seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: out, then you may want to work it further.
[SPEAKER_02]: But honestly, the Golden Goat S1s that I
put out, people are finding phenotypes
[SPEAKER_02]: that look just like the original Golden
Goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get a six pack of seeds and they'll
find one that looks just like the original
[SPEAKER_02]: Golden Goat in that pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my dude, I hope that was a sufficient
answer to your question.
