[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for a Thursday episode of the
grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to call these Thursday episodes the
Thursday quickie.
[SPEAKER_01]: These quickies are brought to you by our
friends at the hella dank seed bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check them out at dank seed
dot store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, it won't be a
quickie unless we get started right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get on with the grow from your
heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again for joining me for a quickie
Thursday episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to start these episodes by letting
you know what I'm smoking today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been taking dabs of cantaloupe haze
live batter from our friends at the garden
[SPEAKER_01]: of Weeden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also been smoking some of the
Skywalker batter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about this cantaloupe haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has got a super golden texture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a slab of hard butter
sitting on a piece of parchment paper and
[SPEAKER_01]: it smells.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells like the rind of a cantaloupe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells like you ate a little too close
to the edge of a cantaloupe, but I really
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoy it and I think it's delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a super great head high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's almost gone and I'm going to
be sad when that happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to my friends at the garden
of Weeden for the great concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get on with the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, if you are a
cannabis consumer, you're probably
[SPEAKER_01]: familiar with the website or the
application known as weed maps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Weed maps is an app that you can go to and
you can find what cannabis products are
[SPEAKER_01]: available in your local dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes I want to drive to
apothecary.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about 45 minutes away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to see what they've got before I
drive up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I simply open up the weed maps application
on my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I search for apothecary in the search bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shows me brands, products, a whole
bunch of other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it shows you storefronts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I click on storefronts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes me right to the apothecary
storefront.
[SPEAKER_01]: I click on the storefront part,
then it takes me to their menu and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: able to see what is available at
apothecary.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the places do not list the
pricing.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, they list what's available and
the breakdown of availability in weight,
[SPEAKER_01]: like how much, or if a half a gram is
available, a gram, an eighth, a quarter,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever increments they're selling it,
they usually let you know what's
[SPEAKER_01]: available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to look at the map before I
drive up to apothecary and make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: they've got something I'm shopping for
before I waste my time and go up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just things I'm not interested
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've always got something I want,
but I like to make sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people are looking for
specific things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go in weed maps and you can go in
the search bar and you can type in
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever product you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps you want lemon Jeffrey flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can type in your area code or your zip
code and you can type in lemon Jeffrey and
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll search for lemon Jeffrey products
for you in your area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can drive to that dispensary and
get the lemon Jeffrey flowers you desire.
[SPEAKER_01]: This system has worked pretty well in
theory, as long as all of the dispensaries
[SPEAKER_01]: update their inventory.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way people don't drive there thinking
there's something there in stock that they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now weed maps has been all over the
nation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in every state that's got
recreational or medical marijuana and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything has gone well until recently
when California decided to start
[SPEAKER_01]: legalizing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I've got an article here from the LA
Times that I'd like to share with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the headline says, California's battle
with weed maps shows the growing pains of
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to read the article.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was written by, let me give
somebody credit here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Times editorial board.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have a name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says written by the Times editorial
board and no specific author.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to the author.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody should get credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Weed maps may have positioned itself as
yelp for pot shoppers, but state
[SPEAKER_01]: regulators say there's a crucial
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bulk of the businesses in weed maps'
directory are illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even under state law.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's undermining one of the primary
goals of Prop 64, which was to extinguish
[SPEAKER_01]: the black market in favor of a state
authorized, highly regulated cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last month, the state's Bureau of Cannabis
Control sent weed maps a cease and desist
[SPEAKER_01]: letter threatening fines and criminal
penalties if the company did not remove
[SPEAKER_01]: the listing for unlicensed marijuana
businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: The weed map site and app lets users
search through listings submitted by
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana dispensaries and delivery
services, then offer their own review.
[SPEAKER_01]: The board said the Irvine based company is
violating a state law that bars websites
[SPEAKER_01]: from publishing a cannabis based
advertisement if it does not display a
[SPEAKER_01]: license number.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me give you guys a little bit of an
update.
[SPEAKER_01]: In California, they just rolled out their
legalization of recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are issuing licenses to stores,
but they are doing it very slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the businesses that exist in
California, the dispensaries are not
[SPEAKER_01]: licensed and they are still awaiting
licensing, but California is fucking with
[SPEAKER_01]: them and dragging it out and not going to
give them licensing so they can cause
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they're saying that the dispensaries
that are advertising on weed maps that are
[SPEAKER_01]: not licensed is where the problem comes
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say that there's a state law that
bars websites from publishing a cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: business advertisement if it does not
display a license number.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on their website, you can clearly go
see products from many dispensaries and
[SPEAKER_01]: none of them have a license number.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to keep going with the
article and it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The warning letter was part of a broader
crackdown launched after licensed
[SPEAKER_01]: retailers complained that they were being
undercut
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they're trying to say that since the
reviews are compiled from users and the
[SPEAKER_01]: data is put in from dispensaries,
that weed maps is not the one responsible
[SPEAKER_01]: for it and they are not part of that rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: The article keeps going and it goes like
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because the state may not be able to
compel weed maps to take down illegal
[SPEAKER_01]: listings.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, that doesn't mean the company
shouldn't do it as a good corporate
[SPEAKER_01]: citizen and supporter of proposition 64.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, weed maps executives said they
will banish unlicensed pot shops from the
[SPEAKER_01]: site eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, weed maps eventually just doesn't
cut it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dilemma here is that California is
experiencing the growing pains of
[SPEAKER_01]: transitioning its marijuana business.
[SPEAKER_01]: From a largely uncontrolled, unchecked and
underground industry into a highly
[SPEAKER_01]: regulated taxpaying marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although it remains illegal under federal
law.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was never going to be an easy
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Los Angeles alone had hundreds,
perhaps well over a thousand medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of them unauthorized,
plus growers, manufacturers and other
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis businesses that were operating
prior to the passage of Prop 64 in
[SPEAKER_01]: November 2016, legalizing recreational
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ballot measure gave cities and the
state roughly a year to develop
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations and a licensing regime before
commercial recreation cannabis sales could
[SPEAKER_01]: officially begin on January 1st.
[SPEAKER_01]: Weed maps contends that it's too soon to
begin cracking down on unlicensed pot
[SPEAKER_01]: shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of which have been operating
legitimately or not as medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: These businesses often want to join the
legal market for recreational pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they are located in cities that are
still developing regulations or have
[SPEAKER_01]: delayed licensing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Others are based in cities that continue
to ban recreational cells, which local
[SPEAKER_01]: governments are allowed to do under Prop
64.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's where weed maps is right.
[SPEAKER_01]: California should be making it easy and as
easy as possible for legitimate operators
[SPEAKER_01]: to get licensed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simply forcing weed maps to remove
listings of unlicensed operators won't
[SPEAKER_01]: magically diminish the black market if the
legal market isn't big enough to meet
[SPEAKER_01]: demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, weed maps is helping
to extend the life of unlawful operators
[SPEAKER_01]: and hurting the businesses that have gone
through the expense of getting licensed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That ultimately impedes the effort to
clean up the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why one of weed maps competitors,
Leafly, announced last month that it was
[SPEAKER_01]: removing listings for unlicensed
businesses from its pot shop finding
[SPEAKER_01]: website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Weed maps and others in the cannabis
industry have recognized that they have a
[SPEAKER_01]: vital role in helping California tame the
wild west marijuana market into the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulated industry envisioned by Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sooner they do, the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, that article was
from the LaTimes.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there are a couple of things I want to
touch on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I find ironic, these illegal pot
shops that are advertising on weed maps
[SPEAKER_01]: are being discovered by authorities on
weed maps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're kind of snitching on
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you have to do is go to weed maps,
pull up a list of dispensaries in your
[SPEAKER_01]: area, and then pull up a list of licensed
dispensaries in your area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anybody that's not on that license
list, you just drive to them and fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: raid them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're asking for trouble doing it
that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're kind of dry snitching on
themselves doing it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess if it gets business and
traffic in, maybe it's worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also, I applaud weed maps for
sticking up for these businesses that
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't able to get their licensing and
aren't able to jump through the hoops
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly enough because California is part
of the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you make the rules impossible to
comply with, it makes it hard to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: successful business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And weed maps is being compassionate and
giving these small businesses the
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity to get their licensing
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before they pull them from the website,
or at least that's what weed maps wants us
[SPEAKER_01]: to think.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out to weed maps for first
holding their ground and also for
[SPEAKER_01]: supporting the small dispensaries that
either have not gotten their license or
[SPEAKER_01]: are just being cowboys and are not going
to license until they're shut down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the story of weed maps in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's one of many stories
we're going to see with the ever changing
[SPEAKER_01]: landscape of recreational and medical
cannabis in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to see a lot of dispensary
businesses facing weird changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for hanging
out for a Thursday episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do a couple of shout outs.
