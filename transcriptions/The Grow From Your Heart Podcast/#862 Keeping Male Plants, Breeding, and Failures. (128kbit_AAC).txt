[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, where do we go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: In a previous episode and a couple of
previous episodes We've been talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: things that we can use that are not
necessarily designed for our grows But we
[SPEAKER_00]: can use them to benefit our grow make our
grow life better easier more enjoyable
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been getting great submissions my two
most recent favorite submissions have came
[SPEAKER_00]: in things that we missed one of them was a
pressure washer that's right a pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: washer why not use a pressure washer to
clean your reservoirs your trays just
[SPEAKER_00]: about anything you can get wet all that
plastic stuff that you buy clean it with a
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure washer that'll get it nice and
clean there you go a pressure washer is a
[SPEAKER_00]: great suggestion also be very careful with
that pressure washer do not do not mistake
[SPEAKER_00]: that thing it will it will really pressure
wash the shit out of you as well that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: powerful shit if it's cleaning that grime
off imagine what it will do to your ankle
[SPEAKER_00]: your toe it will get you so be careful
respect it put some respect on its name
[SPEAKER_00]: another device that we could use in the
grow that we overlooked that I actually
[SPEAKER_00]: often use is a scrubber that attaches to a
drill that's right just looks like a
[SPEAKER_00]: bathroom scrubber or a toilet scrubber
brush but it goes right into my drill and
[SPEAKER_00]: I can clean trays I can clean reservoirs
mainly clean the cloner there's an easy
[SPEAKER_00]: cloner sitting right there that needs to
be cleaned that easy cloner will get
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaned with that drill just just drill
scrub it real hard put some phisan 20 on
[SPEAKER_00]: that bitch and just scrub it down and then
rinse it real nice but that drill
[SPEAKER_00]: attachment with the scrubby on it real
nice device will really speed up your
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaning process so you guys keep sending
in those recommendations those suggestions
[SPEAKER_00]: of items devices items tools devices
purchases products that we can use in the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room that we're not necessarily
designed for the grow room but we'll make
[SPEAKER_00]: our grow room experience more enjoyable
all right before we get too far let me
[SPEAKER_00]: remind you about the holiday sale at
iredirect.com that's right iredirect.com
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a sale happening make sure you go
check the holiday pricing and the holiday
[SPEAKER_00]: inventory go grab those holiday packs
before the end of the year at iredirect
[SPEAKER_00]: .com did I say it enough times to get it
in your head iredirect.com all right
[SPEAKER_00]: that's all the advertising we've got for
the start of the show let's work our way
[SPEAKER_00]: into the question and answer portion of
today's podcast of course I have a website
[SPEAKER_00]: that website is iregenetics.com at the top
of that website there's a row of tabs one
[SPEAKER_00]: of those tabs does say grow help or grow
questions if you click on that tab and you
[SPEAKER_00]: send me a good grow question maybe I'll
read your question here on the podcast if
[SPEAKER_00]: I do read your question here on the show
that means you win a coupon code for a
[SPEAKER_00]: free pack of seeds at iredirect.com
today's first question came from my new
[SPEAKER_00]: friend Gaimondo Gaimondo thank you for the
great question make sure you check your
[SPEAKER_00]: inbox because you've got a coupon code for
a free pack of seeds the question goes a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit like this it says what do you
think of cold start dabs I am not a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: fan of cold start dabs I take big gigantic
dabs and if I were to cold start them I
[SPEAKER_00]: would just leave a big sticky puddley mess
I prefer a real hot real big dab that
[SPEAKER_00]: makes you choke makes your eyes red makes
your voice and throat all gooey makes you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to clear your throat a bunch of times
in a podcast almost makes you want to go
[SPEAKER_00]: lay on the floor for a few minutes I got a
tile kitchen floor here sometimes or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: even the bathroom you ever been lit up and
you just go lay in the bathtub because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's nice and cool and it feels good I
like the dabs that make you think about
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that you're like I need to go lay in
the bathtub with no water and just feel
[SPEAKER_00]: the cool maybe you find yourself just
laying in the bathtub in there with a big
[SPEAKER_00]: bag of chips just scrolling on your phone
it's been like 40 minutes you don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what happened those are the kind of dabs I
like to take I cannot achieve that with
[SPEAKER_00]: the cold start dab it just doesn't get me
there I take a pretty monstrous dab I like
[SPEAKER_00]: a turp slurper or a blender I like a nice
pretty decent rig a decent temperature I
[SPEAKER_00]: usually go I'm not even gonna tell you my
temperature don't try this at home but no
[SPEAKER_00]: a cold start dab is not for me but if
you're doing cold start dabs and it works
[SPEAKER_00]: for you man do that a lot of my friends do
cold starts it's great to watch it's great
[SPEAKER_00]: to see it they enjoy it it is just not for
me and that's one of the beautiful things
[SPEAKER_00]: about growing smoking and consuming ganja
you could do it however you enjoy doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: and I can't judge you for it if you want
to hit a 12-foot bong if you want to smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: out of a coconut if you want to carve out
an apple or if you want to smoke out of a
[SPEAKER_00]: $3,000 dab rig do your thing pimpin I
encourage all of the above as long as you
[SPEAKER_00]: are enjoying it to your fullest so I got
no judgment on your cold starts except
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not for me they're great for other
people do that shit there is more to this
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm rambly obviously I took some big fat
non cold start dabs there's more though it
[SPEAKER_00]: goes on it says also I would like to do a
shout out to the Paki gold freebie I got
[SPEAKER_00]: from you with my order Paki gold grows
awesomely and it is my favorite plant from
[SPEAKER_00]: the order that's it's pretty awesome that
the freebie ended up being your favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: plant from the order I like that says I'm
just at the end of veg so the growth so
[SPEAKER_00]: far is all I can comment about okay you're
in that makes sense thank you my friend
[SPEAKER_00]: from Gaimondo Gaimondo that was a good
comment a good question I'm not into the
[SPEAKER_00]: cold start dabs but good shout out for the
Paki gold ladies and gentlemen he said the
[SPEAKER_00]: freebies if you order over $30 at
iredirect.com your order will come with a
[SPEAKER_00]: free two pack of Paki gold feminized seeds
Gaimondo make sure you check your inbox
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a coupon code for a free pack
of seeds all right let's keep this episode
[SPEAKER_00]: going while I've still got some voice left
those dabs seem to be killing my throat
[SPEAKER_00]: this question also came from the grow help
tab this one did not leave a fun name they
[SPEAKER_00]: left our whole name I 'm not going to call
you by your full name this one came from
[SPEAKER_00]: my new friend Robert Robert thank you for
the great question the question goes a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit like this it says I've listened
to you for many years well thank you bro
[SPEAKER_00]: it says what I haven't heard and I would
like to hear is what breeding projects
[SPEAKER_00]: have failed to make it to release and why
it's a really good really humbling
[SPEAKER_00]: question and then I realized like I treat
my podcast like I treat my social media I
[SPEAKER_00]: only post my victories on social media I
don't really post my fails nobody does we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't go post our bullshit some people do
I see a lot of crying ass people but most
[SPEAKER_00]: of us don't post our failures our
shortcomings on social media we post the
[SPEAKER_00]: victories we post the the picture of the
new car the successful garden the new
[SPEAKER_00]: shoes the winds we don't ever post the
losses on social media and I guess I kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of do that here as well so let me be
humbled let me give you some full
[SPEAKER_00]: disclosure there have been breeding
projects that I have crossed and have been
[SPEAKER_00]: complete trash most of the time I'll take
a a male plant and or a reversal plant
[SPEAKER_00]: however you want to go about the story and
I'll pollinate multiple females that way
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got more opportunity to see what
that pollen donor is doing across the
[SPEAKER_00]: board it's we get to see more opportunity
for the progeny to see what they're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: show us it's just something I like to do
as a breeder so then it gives me more
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to have success it also gives
me more opportunity to have a failure so
[SPEAKER_00]: only one time has this happened I used a
pollen donor it was a female plant it was
[SPEAKER_00]: a lemon skunk kush plant that when I
smoked the flower from a dispensary the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower was amazing I'm not even gonna give
them a shout out because the owner of that
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary is a dick I hope you hear this
so I bought this clone of a lemon skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: kush and the so I bought the flowers from
the dispensary and smoked them and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: like that shit's fire and I went back to
get more and like we have a clone of it so
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought the clone I grew the clone I grew
the clone equally if not better quality
[SPEAKER_00]: than what the dispensary was selling me so
I've got the clone of this lemon skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: kush everybody in the crew loves it I was
allegedly black marketing flower stall the
[SPEAKER_00]: crew here and everybody was loving it
they're like bro I like smoking that I
[SPEAKER_00]: love smoking that and I've been dipping my
toes into breeding projects I've done some
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinations at this point made some
crosses that we've smoked in the house and
[SPEAKER_00]: in the crew and they were great people
enjoyed it so I've got this lemon skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: kush and I'm like man I want to breed with
this this thing's fucking fire so I
[SPEAKER_00]: reversed it and I made s1s with it and
then I pollinated I don't even remember at
[SPEAKER_00]: this point there's a g13 in there there's
a bunch of older stuff that I used to have
[SPEAKER_00]: way back in the day there's blueberry in
there a bunch of different shit I'd have
[SPEAKER_00]: to look back and like scroll through
photos or something and find out exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: what it was honestly don't remember but I
remember it was a lemon skunk kush pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: donor to like I usually do nine females in
a room so it's probably nine different
[SPEAKER_00]: girls in a five by five I hit them with
pollen I flowered out all those plants I
[SPEAKER_00]: made the seeds I collected the seeds I
grew out different batches of those seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: like probably ten of each back in the day
that's just how we used to do it do bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers back in the day can't do it now
but I ran out a bunch of those and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: was excited about it they smelled so good
they looked so beautiful I called all the
[SPEAKER_00]: good homies over pops Kevin Mike probably
crazy Tony at the time who else used to
[SPEAKER_00]: come over it doesn't matter bro I digress
is what my grandma would say all the crew
[SPEAKER_00]: came over we gathered in the basement put
on that 70 show or a Pink Floyd video or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever the boys used to want to watch
we'd just watch cool shit all day probably
[SPEAKER_00]: a sub cool video at that point in time and
then we all fucking rolled up joints and
[SPEAKER_00]: packed up bowls and we all smoked all this
lemon skunk kush crosses together
[SPEAKER_00]: different variations different out crosses
and after a little while I noticed it I
[SPEAKER_00]: was looking around the room I was like
nobody acts looks or seems high in any
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of way and I was like guys what do
you think about it and everyone's like but
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to say anything I'm not
fucking high at all and I was like well
[SPEAKER_00]: this is weird like nobody is high from any
of this weed so we kept smoking and like I
[SPEAKER_00]: was like no really I don't feel high so we
went and smoked with other people and I
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked it with other people and I gave it
to other people and I was like what'd you
[SPEAKER_00]: think and like that weed wasn't that good
that shit was kind of trash so yeah a full
[SPEAKER_00]: batch of breeding a whole five by five
tent worth lemon skunk kush a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: percent garbage all those seeds got thrown
away probably fed to chickens I think
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse's chickens got to eat a lot of those
fucking seeds so yeah that was one that
[SPEAKER_00]: failed and then oftentimes when I do the
nine plant so let's just say
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothetically I stick with the nine plant
idea it's just a good way to do things I
[SPEAKER_00]: put a male or a pollen donor and another
tent get that one going I've got my
[SPEAKER_00]: females in a five by five there's nine of
them that keeps me compliant with my
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers and then I just pollinate that
most of the time seven out of those nine
[SPEAKER_00]: are quality enough to put out there's
always two of them that I'm like I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know sometimes it's things that I didn't
realize you guys would really love
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes I hold back something cuz I'm
like oh this plant takes fucking 140 days
[SPEAKER_00]: to flower I'm not gonna put that out and
then I show a couple people pictures of it
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're like bro why don't you sell me
seeds of that I would fucking pay an arm
[SPEAKER_00]: and a leg so I put them up on the website
just to test the waters and you guys buy
[SPEAKER_00]: the shit out of them so sometimes it's
stuff that I don't think you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: like but you really do sometimes it's
stuff that I don't approve of I should not
[SPEAKER_00]: have put out night nurse full disclosure
that was fucking ten years ago those seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: are done they're never gonna be made again
night nurse did not live up to my
[SPEAKER_00]: standards that's why it went out quickly
and disappeared quickly the few seeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: did go out when I grew it it came out good
my test grow but my test numbers were very
[SPEAKER_00]: limited back then I didn't have a big test
team like I do now so my testers looked
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice I was happy with that my buddy
Doug was my patient at the time he's the
[SPEAKER_00]: one that loved the night nurse the most I
kind of bred it for him him and Mike and
[SPEAKER_00]: they approved they loved it I put out a
bunch of seeds of it and I just didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: from the photos and the samples I got to
smoke I didn't approve I wish I would not
[SPEAKER_00]: have put my name my brand my logo my seal
on that so night nurse was kind of a fail
[SPEAKER_00]: not up to my standards in my opinion that
was a grateful dog breeding project that
[SPEAKER_00]: came from the grateful dog pollen donor
grateful dog to Torah Bora almost
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else I did with the grateful
dog was fucking awesome except the night
[SPEAKER_00]: nurse that one they just didn't however
the genes when you throw all the genes up
[SPEAKER_00]: in the air and let them land into the
Petri dish to make that fucking strain
[SPEAKER_00]: those the shit didn't work out well they
didn't mix well that was fucking like
[SPEAKER_00]: pudding I'm trying to think of two flavors
that don't mix well together and it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: working in my brain it's like orange juice
and toothpaste they just fucking didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: mix up real well so yeah that's two
examples I can give you one full failed
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding project every seed thousands of
seeds probably five thousand seeds got
[SPEAKER_00]: turned into chicken feed and then one so
if there were nine plants there's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: night nurse there's probably Capel tin
there was Kalanji there's bounty killer
[SPEAKER_00]: what else is in that room grateful dog ass
ones so that's five of them those were all
[SPEAKER_00]: successful night nurse was made in the
same batch and that plant fucking sucked
[SPEAKER_00]: so yeah that one shouldn't have been
released all right I think I rambled
[SPEAKER_00]: enough about that my dude Robert make sure
you check your inbox because I am going to
[SPEAKER_00]: send you a coupon code for a free pack of
seeds at iry direct com that was a fun
[SPEAKER_00]: question thank you I like that one all
right we're gonna keep the energy moving I
[SPEAKER_00]: finally got the goober out of my throat
let's stay focused I got the energy right
[SPEAKER_00]: this one came also from the grow help tab
at iry direct com this one came from our
[SPEAKER_00]: new friend ghost pirate ahoy matey um the
question goes a little bit like this it
[SPEAKER_00]: says rasta Jeff first off I want to start
by saying that I appreciate you more than
[SPEAKER_00]: you know for your knowledge bombs on
breeding especially feminized breeding bro
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you that means a lot to me thank you
for thinking that I'm dropping knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: bombs I just share what I think is helpful
I want to be helpful to you guys and these
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of comments and stuff these are I say
it jokingly all the time this is recharge
[SPEAKER_00]: for me there really is this is fertilizer
nutrients this is bloom booster you're
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding me with these types of comments so
thank you I do appreciate that um so you
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate me that did sometimes it's all
dude wants to hear I appreciate you so
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you for that I will stay focused all
the knowledge I drop about breeding I just
[SPEAKER_00]: know what I know from experience I don't
have all the I might not have all the book
[SPEAKER_00]: terms all the organic chemistry knowledge
I don't have all the the schooling and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that a lot of people do that we see
on the internet but I've done it and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that counts for something and I'm
confident in what I'm doing and I can see
[SPEAKER_00]: the results what does and I just admitted
some shit doesn't work so man thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm humbled and I appreciate this comment
already it says you've changed my game and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm now able to feel some confidence when
breeding that is fucking awesome dude I
[SPEAKER_00]: just said I'm confident so now I'm glad
you're as confident confidence goes a long
[SPEAKER_00]: way don't don't second-guess yourself
don't double-step keep moving forward be
[SPEAKER_00]: confident now there is a question in here
it says I have a question I have a
[SPEAKER_00]: partially partially pollinated plant
that's harder than it looks you say that
[SPEAKER_00]: at home I have a partially pollinated
plant which means I've only pollinated one
[SPEAKER_00]: branch now my question pertains to this 18
and 6 light cycle after the pollination I
[SPEAKER_00]: know where this is headed and I've got
some strong advice for you it said will
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant still be able to handle the 18
and 6 light cycle without throwing out
[SPEAKER_00]: intersex traits which that rings so many
bells that I want to talk about or should
[SPEAKER_00]: I pollinate the whole plant um so with
this listener I think they're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about is I recommend when pollinating
plants when you're strictly using this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant for pollen after pollination I turn
that timer to 18 hours on and six hours
[SPEAKER_00]: off right after pollination until harvest
time that is my practice for a seeded crop
[SPEAKER_00]: now if I were to do this to a sensei crop
a crop with no seeds I would only initiate
[SPEAKER_00]: that 18 six for the last two weeks of
flower the reason is if we leave these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants on 18 six for too long they will
revetch they will begin to go back into a
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative state we
[SPEAKER_00]: do not want that to happen to the part of
your 18 six but not until then because it
[SPEAKER_00]: will revedge you the question you asked is
will it show will it show intersex traits
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a whole another problem that's a
whole another ball game whole another
[SPEAKER_00]: issue whole more bag of shit to deal with
if that plant shows intersex traits at
[SPEAKER_00]: that point I would almost recommend not
breeding with it not doing the the cross
[SPEAKER_00]: at all because you've got intersex traits
I would abandon ship at that point no need
[SPEAKER_00]: to make more intersex traits I know
there's gonna be some controversy that's
[SPEAKER_00]: okay I accept and welcome that come with
respect maybe I'll respond I can't respond
[SPEAKER_00]: to every message but so I would ditch it
if you see those intersex traits what I
[SPEAKER_00]: would definitely almost guarantee you're
going to see though more than intersex
[SPEAKER_00]: traits if you do this early if you do the
pollination and put it back on 18 six the
[SPEAKER_00]: sensei part that you want to smoke will
look like shit it will revedge it'll look
[SPEAKER_00]: terrible so don't do that I recommend
continuing with the 18 and six light cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: all right my dude did I even say yeah
ghost pirate I like the name I said that
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure you check your inbox because
you've got a coupon code for a free pack
[SPEAKER_00]: of seeds at I read direct dot com that's

questions I finally got some rhythm got my
[SPEAKER_00]: voice fixed up I'm gonna reach over here I
just took the top question off the pile
[SPEAKER_00]: this question has not been vetted screened
I don't know what's gonna come up this
[SPEAKER_00]: could be blatant advertising this could be
some weird fucking Christmas list but
[SPEAKER_00]: we're gonna read it we're gonna see what
happens this one came from the grow help
[SPEAKER_00]: tab at I read direct calm since I'm giving
you a bonus question here on the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: now is the time for you to click like and
click subscribe did I say subscribe did I

[SPEAKER_00]: question came from our new friend Smitty
thank you for the great question Smitty
[SPEAKER_00]: check your inbox you got a coupon code for
a free pack of seeds at I read direct calm
[SPEAKER_00]: it says longtime listener and customer I
appreciate that thank you says my question
[SPEAKER_00]: is if I'm breeding a regular plant which
means a non-feminized plant I would assume
[SPEAKER_00]: with a feminized plant will the seeds be
regular my quick answer is yes those are
[SPEAKER_00]: regular seeds the easiest way I can
simplify that's where you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: remember it is what did you do to into
your brain in my teaching opinion all
[SPEAKER_00]: right so that was a quick answer there
quick question I'm gonna burn out another
[SPEAKER_00]: one ladies and gentlemen also since I'm
gonna burn out one more question make sure

[SPEAKER_00]: on your podcast several times yes I've
been explaining fem seeds for quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: while trying to clean up the
misinformation that's out there then it
[SPEAKER_00]: goes on it says what are the ways to
preserve or keep a male plant around for
[SPEAKER_00]: use and later projects I appreciate the
commitment to sharing bro Tokamak thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you for the great question once again
check your inbox now the answer to this
[SPEAKER_00]: how do I keep a male plant around for
future projects the same way we keep a
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plant around I would call it a
father plant I guess but it would live
[SPEAKER_00]: right in the mother room right amongst the
other ladies basically I've got a light
[SPEAKER_00]: dedicated to I have a whole section
dedicated to where I keep genetics that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the mother area I give it a 19 and 5 light
cycle I know that's a confusing light
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle 18 6 is not enough I like the 19 5
because some of the more sativa dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: is that even the proper term anymore argue
about that in the comments some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: more tropical narrow leaf varietals they
will flower if they get root bound and
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get enough light at the same time so
I'm just buying myself a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: time by going with that 19 5 they won't
flower sometimes the Congo the original
[SPEAKER_00]: Congo plant it likes the 19 5 is a mother
plant it veggies very well under 19 5 18 6
[SPEAKER_00]: it grows a little bit too quickly and
it'll get root bound and then it will
[SPEAKER_00]: begin to flower before I want it to that's
a pain in the ass so I keep the mother
[SPEAKER_00]: plants the father plants on a 19 5 light
cycle I give them just a little bit of fan
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of air circulation and then I
feed them just a basic veg nutrients they
[SPEAKER_00]: get veg food so a lot of times if I feed
my veg area some of that leftover becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: the base for my moms I'll just add that to
some water and maybe boost it up a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit but it's basically base nutrients like
whatever brand you're using the base
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes I'll throw a little liquid karma
in there and then a lot of times I just
[SPEAKER_00]: dose everything with recharge the whole
fucking all the plants will get hit with
[SPEAKER_00]: recharge so base nutrients liquid karma
recharge you don't need a whole lot you
[SPEAKER_00]: could just buy real cheap veg nutrients
for your mother plants you need some NPK
[SPEAKER_00]: just basic nitrogen a little bit of
phosphorus basic potassium give them some
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes make sure they're healthy like
pest and problem-free don't get any
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens no powdery mildew no fungus is
in there and don't get any bugs prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: all the bugs people overlook the
importance of how important the mom room
[SPEAKER_00]: is that's where it all starts so before
you can have clones veg or flour you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to have healthy mother plants keep them as
healthy as you can I apply pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: rotation to my mother room once a week if
I see any issues I hit it Monday and
[SPEAKER_00]: Thursday if I think it's legit I hit it
Monday I've been going kind of hard so I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna go just every Monday for a little
bit and make sure there's no problems I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: about to start a breeding project need it
nice and clean but um keep them under 19.5
[SPEAKER_00]: light feed them a vegetative fucking
nutrients where was I going from there um
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking about I'm gonna keep them
pest free spray them apply a pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking frequently or however you want to
do it keep them pest free but I recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: keep those moms pest free then pot size is
very important of course the bigger the
[SPEAKER_00]: pot you keep the plant in the longer you
can keep that plant around but also the
[SPEAKER_00]: larger the pot you keep it in the more
rapidly it will grow so you're kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: cheating yourself I don't know it's a race
I like to keep my mother plants in a three
[SPEAKER_00]: or a five gallon pot if I had more space I
would do seven gallons but I legit don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have more room for that I'm working with
what I've got in a commercial facility
[SPEAKER_00]: they go and in a commercial environment
the moms are in fucking sevens fucking 10
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 they go in large pots because we need a
lot of cuts and they're bigger and a
[SPEAKER_00]: personal grow which was probably what most
of us are doing here I use a three or a
[SPEAKER_00]: five gallon pot um veg that bitch out veg
it clean up the bottoms top it let it
[SPEAKER_00]: branch out a little bit it'll make like a
nice bushy shape and those will be where
[SPEAKER_00]: all your cuts come from that's how I keep
a mother plant uh don't let it get root
[SPEAKER_00]: bound because a lot of these plants when
they get root bound they will start to
[SPEAKER_00]: flower that's when you'll start to see
problems it'll look like it's over watered
[SPEAKER_00]: underwater got a ph issue it's really just
root bound wants a bigger pot it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: nowhere to go so I keep those plants
around until they're usually uh three
[SPEAKER_00]: fourish feet tall they're kind of bushy
usually it's about three or six months
[SPEAKER_00]: before I have to take more clones and use
one of those clones as my replacement for
[SPEAKER_00]: my mom plant then I just start fresh with
all new moms grow them out get the clones
[SPEAKER_00]: as I need so I know this is about keeping
male plants so this is where I'll jump to
[SPEAKER_00]: the the male part of this I do basically
the same thing except I'm more careful
[SPEAKER_00]: because if that male plant does start to
pre flower or auto flower on you because
[SPEAKER_00]: you didn't give it enough light enough
root space it's going to be a real bitch
[SPEAKER_00]: to revert that plant back to the veg phase
male plants once they just like you bro
[SPEAKER_00]: once the launch sequence is initiated it
wants to fucking go so if you see that
[SPEAKER_00]: male plant starting to go in flower it's
going to go into flower so try to prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: that with enough light don't get it let it
get root bound feed it properly you can
[SPEAKER_00]: top the male plants cut the tops out make
them bush you can do all that just like a
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plant I do everything the same
except I'm more careful to not stress that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant don't overwater don't underwater
keep the light at 19.5 keep it a good
[SPEAKER_00]: distance away keep that plant healthy I
defoliated a little bit just like
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else clean up the bottoms but
just don't stress it because if it does go
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower it is even harder to reverse
those back to veg than it is your basic
[SPEAKER_00]: female plants so I guess after all that
rambling the short answer is just treat it
[SPEAKER_00]: just like a veg plant just like a
long-term veg plant just like you would a
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plant if you do keep mothers keep
it in as big of a pot as you can give it
[SPEAKER_00]: 19.5 keep it pest and problem-free feed it
and give it the appropriate size pot don't
[SPEAKER_00]: let that pocket too cold on the ground
also those cold pots will piss off that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and make it go into flower it'll
think it's the end of the world so when
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants think that they're under
stress they think it's the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: world that's when they start to panic and
they'll go into flower or they will throw
[SPEAKER_00]: intersex traits or they will show their
intersex traits or they will have a
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical reaction within them that will
cause them to express intersex and I say
[SPEAKER_00]: that right bro I know who's listening to
this who's gonna give me feedback here but
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when it happens is cannabis wants
to survive cannabis's whole goal is to
[SPEAKER_00]: procreate and survive so that it can make
seeds so that it can grow the next season
[SPEAKER_00]: so that it can repeat and repeat and
repeat that's why the male plants jump up
[SPEAKER_00]: above everybody so they can pollinate get
the pollen down on those ladies the ladies
[SPEAKER_00]: can receive the pollen that's why seeds
are shaped like with a little point so
[SPEAKER_00]: they can land into the dirt and dig
themselves in it's all designed for
[SPEAKER_00]: reproduction and if you don't let these
plants reproduce on their own if you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: let that happen if you prevent that they
want to find a way they're just horny
[SPEAKER_00]: teenagers the boys and the girls they're
gonna do everything they can and just like
[SPEAKER_00]: James Bean calls it the Jurassic Park
theory nature will find a way so if you
[SPEAKER_00]: piss them off if you frustrate them that's
when weird shit will happen they'll find a
[SPEAKER_00]: way they'll say I think it's the end of
the world my roots are too cold I should
[SPEAKER_00]: go into flower or I've been flowering for
fucking 22 weeks and nobody's cut me down
[SPEAKER_00]: why don't I make a seed just to try to
survive nobody's pollinated me yet why
[SPEAKER_00]: don't I start spitting out some seeds of
my own and figure this out shit like that
[SPEAKER_00]: will happen if you put any plant in enough
extreme environment all right my dude toka
[SPEAKER_00]: mac thank you for the great question thank
