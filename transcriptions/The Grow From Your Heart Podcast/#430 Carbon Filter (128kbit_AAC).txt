[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, welcome back, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 430 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds in your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company, and you can find them at www

[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start this podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a delicious dab of something
called Garlic Banger Live Batter from our
[SPEAKER_00]: friends at Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The package says this is a blend of Han
Solo Burger and Headbanger.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is described as diesel,
garlic, and dark roast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would absolutely agree with all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The diesel hits you right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aroma is straight diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is garlicky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really savory.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that dark roast kind of lingers on the
tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost tastes like I just ate garlic
mashed potatoes and washed it down with a
[SPEAKER_00]: sip of sweetened coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy the aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the buzz went straight to my body.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt myself just chill the fuck out
right when I hit this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great work on this concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot
Labs for the Garlic Banger Live Batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I am going to focus on an
email about where to place a carbon filter
[SPEAKER_00]: in a grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get there, I would like to

[SPEAKER_00]: .com slash grow from your heart and all of
the information you need should be right
[SPEAKER_00]: there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that I had an email talking about
where to place a carbon filter in a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This email came in in two parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first part of the email asked about
where to place the carbon filter and
[SPEAKER_00]: blower in a grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second part of the question asked,
is it better to have negative pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: where the tent is sucked in or positive
pressure where the tent is ballooning out?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are growing in grow tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a five by five grow tent is a
great setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very efficient way for somebody to
produce their own medicine without doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of modifications to a home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about
effectively and efficiently setting up a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the tents come with passive vents
at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can lift up a little flap and Velcro
it to the inside of the tent and it will
[SPEAKER_00]: stay open so that you can get passive air
coming into the tent through the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them also have a hole toward the
top on the right and left side of the tent
[SPEAKER_00]: that allow you to run ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use that in some situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we are probably going to focus
mostly on the hole that most of those
[SPEAKER_00]: tents have at the very top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time there's a six or eight
inch hole in the top right back corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use that for exhausting heat,
for exhausting humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where we are most likely going to
run our ducting through in this situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first part of this question is
where do I place my carbon filter in my
[SPEAKER_00]: new tent?
[SPEAKER_00]: In an ideal world you would hang that
carbon filter at the very top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of the tent as close to the center
as you could possibly get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the problem with that is most of those
grow tents are not built sturdily enough
[SPEAKER_00]: to support the weight of a carbon filter,
a blower and some duct work once you've
[SPEAKER_00]: already got a light hanging in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got a sturdy enough tent and
you feel like it can hold the carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: filter and the blower and the light on
that frame that you've already got built
[SPEAKER_00]: in there, you can hang the carbon filter
inside of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a well-designed grow room I like to
hang my carbon filter and my blower from
[SPEAKER_00]: the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to have it up high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to get it up off the floor for a
couple of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, that floor space is very
valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to use all of my floor space for
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to take up real estate on the
ground with extra equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would prefer to hang it if possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the air that I want to remove from
the grow room is usually that stale hot
[SPEAKER_00]: stagnant air up at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: The humidity and the heat are going to
rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's put the extraction filter and the
extraction fan up there and pull that
[SPEAKER_00]: crappy air out of the room and shoot it
right out of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I said in an ideal world we would hang
that filter from the ceiling, from those
[SPEAKER_00]: bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be up high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that carbon filters and
blowers are quite heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't trust most of those tents to
support a carbon filter, a blower,
[SPEAKER_00]: the duct work, and my light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how I set up a grow tent in
most situations and in most environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now one thing we should talk about before
we start setting up our tent is are we
[SPEAKER_00]: running open or ducted hoods, which means
does your light setup have an open bulb to
[SPEAKER_00]: where that heat from the bulb is just
filling your grow room and your grow space
[SPEAKER_00]: and your grow tent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or did you buy a vented hood, which means
there are ducts, coming off of each end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the hood and there is glass between the
bulb and your canopy, trapping the heat
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of that fixture and allowing you to
move the heat away from the bulb and away
[SPEAKER_00]: from the grow room by using ducting and a
blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on which type of hood you
purchased or which type of hood you were
[SPEAKER_00]: working with, that will change our setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't be too drastic, but keep in mind
it will make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first let's talk about running a ducted
vented hood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I don't trust my grow tent to
support the weight of that carbon filter
[SPEAKER_00]: right on top of that cinder block.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a cinder block with a carbon
filter sitting on it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's where you've got a couple of
choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my situation, I will take a cinder
block, then the carbon filter,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I set the blower directly on top of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now all of my heavy equipment is right
there on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easily accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I trust it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's not going to fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see the cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know where it plugs in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is safe for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my carbon filter, I've got a cinder
block, carbon filter, blower that's on the
[SPEAKER_00]: floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the ducting runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we have to make adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: My ducting runs to the left side of my
light hood because I have got a ducted
[SPEAKER_00]: light hood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got cinder block, carbon filter,
blower, ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That ducting runs to a light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It attaches to the left side of the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then more ducting attaches to the right
side of the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That ducting that stems off of the right
side of my ducted hood goes right up to
[SPEAKER_00]: that hole on the top right side of the
tent and goes right out of that hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I continue that ducting really long to
where I can aim that air and get that air
[SPEAKER_00]: to where I need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically at this point, I've got a
cinder block in the back corner with a
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon filter, with a blower, with some
ducting going to my light, then out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other side of the light, right out of the
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can run long ducting to where
you can have that air wherever you want
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually hang that ducting all the way
across the ceiling in the grow room in
[SPEAKER_00]: which that tent is sitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I run that ducting all the way to the
door so I can shoot that hot air out of
[SPEAKER_00]: that grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of that room in which the tent is in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I'm not just reheating that room
constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in just a minute, we are going to talk
about kind of environmentally controlling
[SPEAKER_00]: your tent in another room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that real briefly here in
just a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your first option is to go cinder
block, carbon filter, blower, ducting,
[SPEAKER_00]: light, ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you run that ducting out of the
top of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you run that ducting as far as
you need to to get that air away from the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow space as far as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you've got enough cooling,
just dump it right into the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And refresh and replenish the cool air in
that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about that,
like I said, in just a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do not have a sealed light hood,
you're not able to run that ducting over
[SPEAKER_00]: the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're just going to have to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll basically be your carbon filter
sitting on a cinder block.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got your blower and then your
ducting will just run right out of the top
[SPEAKER_00]: of that tent so that you can get that heat
and that stale air right out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea here is we want to remove the
humidity and that stale old stagnant air
[SPEAKER_00]: that all the CO2 is been used up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to replace that air with fresh
air, with fresh CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us, fresh air is oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those plants, fresh air is CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got to get fresh CO2 in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get that old stagnant humid air
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to shoot the heat and old air
out of the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that does is that makes those
passive vents.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just bring air in right at the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those plants are just getting fresh
air so that we're not getting old stagnant
[SPEAKER_00]: air in the tent all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants will really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would always put the carbon filter
inside of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the plants are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to treat that air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want the air coming out of there to
not stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got the carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got your blower, the
appropriate size blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you get the appropriate size
carbon filter and the appropriate size
[SPEAKER_00]: blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to work if you don't
have the right sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure they match up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're getting enough cleaning
for the size space you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're moving enough air for the
size space you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most of my experiences, I have noticed
that a six inch blower and a carbon filter
[SPEAKER_00]: that is somewhere between 12 and 24 inches
tall work perfectly for a five by five
[SPEAKER_00]: grow tent and a home grow type of
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here is something to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our blowers are more efficient at sucking
air than pushing air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have your blower at the last end
of your setup, it is going to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient than if you have your blower
sitting on top of the carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I did recommend that we set our
blower on top of the carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a couple of reasons why I
recommend that.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, it's heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where else are we going to put it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes I will set that blower directly
on the top of my five by five tent with
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom of it just facing right inside
that hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll run the ducting right off of
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you trust your grow tent will hold that
big blower, that six inch hydro farm
[SPEAKER_00]: blower, go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you trust it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is one of the things to look out for.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do that, if you are running a
ducted hood and you do your carbon filter,
[SPEAKER_00]: your ducting, and then your light,
then more ducting, then you have your
[SPEAKER_00]: blower at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do allow the opportunity for aroma to
be sucked up through the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your vented light hood is not 100%
sealed and you have suction at the top of
[SPEAKER_00]: the tent, you are allowing air to be
sucked through that light and then out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that air is not passing through your
carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that air will not be treated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do give the option for odor and aroma
to escape the grow tent at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are going to run a ducting or
ducted vented light, I recommend that
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon filter and the blower stay together
down at the start of the chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are running a light that is not
vented and not ducted and you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: any interruptions in your chain of
airflow, you are able to put that blower
[SPEAKER_00]: at the top outside of the grow tent and it
will suck that air right through your
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon filter, right up through the
ducting, right out of the top of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will remove your heat and humidity
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that you understand the chain of
command or the order in which this
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment should go, you can make the
decision on do I want to put my carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: filter up high in this grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are confident that it will stay up
there, if you're confident that it won't
[SPEAKER_00]: fall, hang it up top because that is the
ideal place.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where the heat is going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the humidity is going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your light will be creating heat the
entire time it is on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got that carbon filter right
above the light, you can just suck that
[SPEAKER_00]: light heat right out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will really help you control the grow
room and control the environment if you
[SPEAKER_00]: can get that up high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I recommend leaving that blower and
that carbon filter on constantly to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: constant airflow and constant air exchange
in that grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I did say that it is ideal to have
that thing up top so that we can remove
[SPEAKER_00]: the heat and humidity, but think about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of using more blower than we
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommended a six inch blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is honestly more fan, more extraction
than what we need in this environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we put that six inch in there and
we run it all the time and you put it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom corner, I am certain that we
are going to get enough air exchange in
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow tent that you won't get old
stagnant air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the fresh air will come in through
the bottom and be replenished,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we are sucking so much air out of that
five by five tent that you will exchange
[SPEAKER_00]: the air very quickly, which brings us to
the second part of this question,
[SPEAKER_00]: which says, is it better to have negative
pressure where the tent is sucked in or
[SPEAKER_00]: positive pressure where the tent is
ballooning out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's think about what we're doing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are putting a blower and a carbon
filter inside of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to zip it up and we're going
to turn it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thing is going to suck a lot of air
outside of that tent very rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a six inch vortex fan moves
something like 400 or 500 cubic feet per
[SPEAKER_00]: minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to plug in that blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll start spinning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll hear it warm up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my impression of a blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it gets to the full speed,
you'll watch that grow tent just suck in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll cave in and it'll start looking like
it's a like it's a big girl trying to suck
[SPEAKER_00]: it in for a photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is exactly what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you know that all of the air coming
out of that tent is being sucked through
[SPEAKER_00]: that blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is all passing through that carbon
filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of the air coming out of that
ducting should be odor free if you set up
[SPEAKER_00]: your chain of command correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me touch on one detail just because
I'm not sure if I made this clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your cinder block, you've got
your carbon filter, and then you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: your blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That air needs to be passing through the
carbon filter and then out of the blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to be sucking, not blowing
through the carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be sucking to where the air is
blown away from the filter, not through
[SPEAKER_00]: the outside of the filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The air wants to come in through the
filter, then out of the blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to make sure we've got the
airflow going the correct direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about if we did it the
opposite way.
[SPEAKER_00]: He asked if the tent should be sucking in
or blowing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the tent were blowing out, that means
that we were pumping a bunch of air into
[SPEAKER_00]: the tent and all of that odor,
all of that aroma would just freely escape
[SPEAKER_00]: through all of the vents, all of the
holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would blow that aroma all through your
house, all through your whole
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that carbon filter would be completely
useless.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be doing the exact opposite of
what you needed it to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your tent should be sucking in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have the carbon filter inside
the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have it sucking the air through
the filter, through the blower,
[SPEAKER_00]: over the light, then right out of that
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I like to run that ducting as far as
I can from the tent if necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I've got the tent in the
corner of one grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I run that ducting across the
ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that ducting just goes right by the
door and it shoots the hot air out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about controlling the
environment in the room in which that grow
[SPEAKER_00]: tent is in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen people waste precious real
estate in a grow tent by placing an air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioner in the grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people put a humidifier or a
dehumidifier inside of a grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that to be a huge waste of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a five by five grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put either a 600 or a thousand watt
light in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got yourself a nice spectrum
king light in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, we've got a really highly
efficient light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bought just the right light for this
five by five space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to try to cram it with plants
and then let's waste a bunch of space by
[SPEAKER_00]: putting an air conditioner in one corner
and a dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff just told us we need to put a
carbon filter in the other corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to run out of floor space very
quickly in the grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got the option, if you've got
the opportunity, I suggest climate
[SPEAKER_00]: controlling the room in which that grow
tent is in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got a grow tent in a spare bedroom
slash office type of space that I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: use very often.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a grow tent in the back corner of
that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have an air conditioner or a
humidifier or a dehumidifier inside that
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do use the central air from my house
to cool that room where that tent is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that air is then sucked into the tent
through those passive vents, which we
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am not always struggling to cool the
temperatures in my grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am relying on my central air or my
heater or whatever season it is in my
[SPEAKER_00]: house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am relying on my home cooling and
heating system to keep that room
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's comfortable for me, I assume it is
probably comfortable for those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a PL monitor in there so I can
always tell what's going on in that grow
[SPEAKER_00]: tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as long as the room is comfortable
when I go in there, that tent is most of
[SPEAKER_00]: the time pretty close to comfortable for
those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants can take it a little hotter
than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't mind being a little warmer,
being a little sweatier than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right inside of that grow tent is just
a few degrees hotter than what the room
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a little bit more humid than
what the room is, which is perfect for the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't focus too much on controlling
the environment in the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to work itself out by
controlling the environment in which that
[SPEAKER_00]: tent is in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of trying to cram a bunch of
gear all inside of your five by five tent
[SPEAKER_00]: and wasting a bunch of space, just focus
more on cooling the room where you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: the tent and that air will flow into the
tent and work itself out.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a large scale, in a professional
horticulture environment, we call that a
[SPEAKER_00]: lung room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The room where all the air is treated,
where all the CO2 is induced, where all
[SPEAKER_00]: the humidity is removed, that is actually
a lung room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're going to have to do something
because if you're just dumping the air out
[SPEAKER_00]: of that grow tent into the room,
that room is going to eventually gather
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the humidity, all of the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a way to either get it
out of the room or cool that room,
[SPEAKER_00]: I simply just leave the bedroom door open
where my grow tent is and that air travels
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the house and mixes with the
regular house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't cause me any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually balances everything
beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the winter, I use that room to keep
part of the house warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the summer, I use the regular air
conditioning to cool down that grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything balances out beautifully over
the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I'm in Colorado, so I don't get
that ridiculous Florida humidity and that
[SPEAKER_00]: ridiculous Southern heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things may be a little bit easier for
me here, which kind of leads me to my next
[SPEAKER_00]: thing to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your carbon filter will work better and
last longer if you run less humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: through the filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can get that air going through
that filter to be a little bit less humid,
[SPEAKER_00]: that will add life and efficiency to your
carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some reason, when the air going
through there is super moist, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: suck the aroma out of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also feel like too much humidity
shortens the life of your carbon in your
[SPEAKER_00]: filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want your filter to last as long
as possible, try to reduce the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity going through that filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more quick piece of advice
when it comes to growing and grow tents,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that is do not fall asleep with the
grow tent open.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like to open the tent and
leave it open so that those plants can get
[SPEAKER_00]: some air so they can breathe a little bit
during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you want to close it up right
before the plants go to sleep for their
[SPEAKER_00]: night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fall asleep with that shit open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you close your grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you shut that down before the
end of the day so that you don't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: major light leak all night long.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will mess up your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will give you the opportunity for
hermaphrodites and all kinds of other
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So set an alarm about 20 or 30 minutes
before that tent closes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe 15 minutes if you're that kind of
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure you get in there every day
before the lights go off and close up your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is real easy to get stoned and forget
that that thing is open.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, smokers and growers,
