[SPEAKER_08]: Yo, what up, Podcast World?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's your boy, Ross DeGeoff, coming to you
with another Throwback Thursday episode.
[SPEAKER_08]: This time, I'm doing episodes 42,
43, and 44 of what used to be known as the
[SPEAKER_08]: iGrowCulture podcast, currently known as
the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Before we get into this block of old
episodes, let me make a couple of updates
[SPEAKER_08]: and disclaimers.
[SPEAKER_08]: All of the social media has changed.
[SPEAKER_08]: The new email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_08]: On Twitter, you can find us under at GFYH
podcast, and on Facebook, simply search
[SPEAKER_08]: for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, any advertisements, giveaways,
or contests that are mentioned in these
[SPEAKER_08]: old episodes, those all have expired and
passed, so don't get too excited.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, let me say one more thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of my methods, techniques,
and ideas have changed in the past three
[SPEAKER_08]: years and 210 episodes.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I say something in these old episodes
that I contradict in a current episode,
[SPEAKER_08]: go with the most current episode.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've learned a lot in 200 episodes,
and I hope you have also.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, with no further ado, ladies and
gentlemen, here's episodes 42,
[SPEAKER_08]: 43, and 44 of what used to be known as the
Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: This one is the iGrowCulture podcast,
now known as the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_08]: podcast.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's time for episode number 42 of the
iGrowCulture podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: They call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, joining me at the table tonight,
we have a brand new guest who's never been
[SPEAKER_08]: on the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up, Tony?
[SPEAKER_08]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_08]: I am great, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to turn down the music a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll talk.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tony is the dude that built my website.
[SPEAKER_08]: He built the iReGenetics website.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tony is responsible for getting the feed
up that hosts the iGrowCulture podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, dude, big huge shout out.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't get the credit you deserve.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Props for that, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Gosh, excuse me while I cough out a lung.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as usual, well, not usual,
as often, I guess, our good buddy Jesse is
[SPEAKER_08]: back.
[SPEAKER_08]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go, podcast land.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you guys have a good Thanksgiving?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I imagine you did.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tony's got an Italian family, so I could
imagine how much you guys ate.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: No headphones for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes this thing cuts out,
bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's this headphone jack here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did it come back?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once in a while, it'll just fart out on
you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just give me that same, where the fuck are
my headphones?
[SPEAKER_08]: Signal and we'll correct it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have it right now either.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll keep going.
[SPEAKER_08]: You back?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: How was your Thanksgiving, bro?
[SPEAKER_08]: I almost skipped you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the privilege of going to four
Thanksgiving dinners.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had two Thanksgiving dinners,
incidentally.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to my aunt Lisa.
[SPEAKER_08]: She made a huge Thanksgiving dinner for
the whole family.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really super cool of you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was tasty.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a vegetarian, so she was really nice
and made some things differently than she
[SPEAKER_08]: would have.
[SPEAKER_08]: She didn't put beef broth and bacon and
some shit, so I had a lot of options to
[SPEAKER_08]: eat.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, a huge shout out to Angela.
[SPEAKER_08]: Angela doesn't have any family here in
Colorado, so I totally invited her to come
[SPEAKER_08]: eat dinner with my family and I,
and she had a great time.
[SPEAKER_08]: She was totally cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: My family loved her.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_08]: I really appreciate that, Angela.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope all the listeners had a good
Thanksgiving, or if you're not into that,
[SPEAKER_08]: then I hope you had a great Thursday and a
good weekend.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some people hate Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm impartial and I go eat with the family
to be social like we should.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's one of the better holidays.
[SPEAKER_02]: At its core, it's one of the better
holidays.
[SPEAKER_08]: What about 420, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, that's an awesome holiday.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like Christmas for the potheads.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, do I have any other stuff we got to
do?
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get to some ads real quick so we can
get right down to business.
[SPEAKER_08]: On this episode, I do plan on doing a
little lesson on nutrients and stuff,
[SPEAKER_08]: and I also have a good question for my
buddy Tony.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tony is an organic chemistry student.
[SPEAKER_08]: How far are you from your degree,
bro?
[SPEAKER_08]: About five, 10 credit hours.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't go to college.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, what does that mean for humans?
[SPEAKER_01]: A semester.
[SPEAKER_08]: A semester.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tony's a new father, so he's distracted
from school.
[SPEAKER_08]: Congrats on that.
[SPEAKER_08]: He hasn't been around as much,
so I'm sure he's not at school as much.
[SPEAKER_08]: Turn down that music.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to yell over it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It feels way better.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, we'll have Tony talk about a couple
things here in a minute.

[SPEAKER_08]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, I've got the coughs from some
dabs.
[SPEAKER_08]: This podcast, you going to cough too?
[SPEAKER_08]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll turn your mic off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those dabs were killer.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they were kind of bigger than what
we should have taken right before a show.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was heavy duty.
[SPEAKER_08]: We wanted to get it done and get to the
show.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you take two dabs that are really big,
you just move on.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have to sit there and dab out.
[SPEAKER_08]: All day.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I think.
[SPEAKER_08]: Big love to treethugger.com.

bit here.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll talk about that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_08]: Big love to all the sponsors, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: We really appreciate you guys helping us
out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also a big shout out to Coot Dogg and
Catherine of the Mystic Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_08]: They let me play all of their music on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: How cool is that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't go much cooler.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to give a big shout out to Spence

[SPEAKER_08]: They came over the other night and helped
me do a chore.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish you guys great luck with the secret
cup that you're headed to.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you guys bring home a trophy and a
whole bunch of prizes and a new rig.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to dab out of your new rig on the
podcast next week.
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll be super awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And get the respect that you totally
deserve and are worthy of.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you hear that?
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't say that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't say that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was my homie, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_08]: I butter him up a lot, but Jesse just said
that you guys deserve respect.
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also a big shout out to Laz.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if you listen to the show,
but I met a dude named Laz recently.
[SPEAKER_08]: We finally met in person.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been online buddies.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got to hang out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool ass, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also a last shout out for a minute,
Mr. Omnio.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_08]: You're finally caught up on episodes.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like we're hanging out in his
kitchen.
[SPEAKER_08]: He left a tweet that says, I'm listening
while I'm making beef bouillon.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like they're hanging out in my
kitchen.
[SPEAKER_08]: So dude, we record this show about 10 feet
from my kitchen.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that could have been a reality almost.
[SPEAKER_08]: You were almost there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come cook for us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come cook for us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody can come cook for us.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a strict vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jesse will eat almost anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tony, you cool?
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything?
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come cook for us guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can be the agriculture chef.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got a couple of topics written down.
[SPEAKER_08]: One of them, this just came up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was kind of rude to somebody the other
day.
[SPEAKER_08]: I realized that they were selling their
plants, their crop got powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_08]: And instead of salvaging it, they decided
to cut the crop down and make live resin.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would not have known about it unless
somebody else told me that they were doing
[SPEAKER_08]: that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I called him out on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I said, you are the difference between
being a caregiver and a cashcropper.
[SPEAKER_08]: You were the person that's going to make
somebody sick because we shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_08]: giving tainted medicine to people who
already have a compromised immune system.
[SPEAKER_08]: Other people in the room treating me like
I was kind of going overboard,
[SPEAKER_08]: but I felt it was kind of my
responsibility to call this dude out and
[SPEAKER_08]: let him know that he's really doing it
wrong and he's making us all look bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's not helping the movement at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's not what I'm working towards.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I wanted to have a little bit of backup
when I approach this dude saying,
[SPEAKER_08]: this is why.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why I brought Tony on the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I was saying earlier, Tony is an
organic chemistry student and he knows a
[SPEAKER_08]: lot about this.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess the simple question I want to
ask, once again, excuse my dab throat.
[SPEAKER_08]: If we take these powdery mildew buds and
we blast them with butane, are we going to
[SPEAKER_08]: get powdery mildew or what is happening?
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you tell me a little about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you're not going to get the powdery
mildew itself, but you'll get the
[SPEAKER_01]: mycotoxins or any sort of toxins that they
create, which powdery mildew is fairly
[SPEAKER_01]: toxic to humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, believe it or not, you could actually
probably be better off smoking the buds
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself, not distributing them,
but it would be less toxic than blasting
[SPEAKER_01]: it and concentrating it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why they call them concentrates
because we're concentrating everything
[SPEAKER_01]: that's in the plant matter into an oil
that is far, far, far more concentrated
[SPEAKER_01]: than the plant matter itself.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hadn't even thought about that route.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're making powdery mildew dabs just
like you are hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're taking the mycotoxins and
concentrating it.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to fix that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got that mic up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you say fairly toxic, could you put
some kind of comparison on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's definitely not like black mold
or anything like that, but I'm sure you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys remember the swag days, the cheap
brick weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That stuff had powdery mildew in it very
often.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even smoking small quantities of that,
you'd end up with chest congestion,
[SPEAKER_01]: bronchitis usually, sore throat for a week
and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could imagine what happens if you
concentrate it 10 to 15 times the dosage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you take a big fat dab like I
like to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you just probably got a good percentage
of mycotoxins in your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the trippy thing about that is it's
not going to show up immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably going to show up in a month
or two, the really weird effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably going to go a little nuts
from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of psychosis in my mind?
[SPEAKER_08]: Behavior change, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Paranoia.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's if we smoke a lot, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not like from one or two dabs to
some PM dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's consistent small doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're smoking it just once a day
for a week or two, it's going to do some
[SPEAKER_01]: weird stuff to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Makes you think, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wonder where your dabs are coming from.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he said, this is something that caught
my mind.
[SPEAKER_08]: He said, it's almost, it would be better
if you smoke the buds than it would be to
[SPEAKER_08]: smoke the hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I also liked that you said,
smoke the damn buds yourself.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't give them out to anybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what you should do.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you grew powdery mildew buds and you
have to do something, smoke it yourself.
[SPEAKER_08]: That way, reap what you sow.
[SPEAKER_08]: That way you're not getting somebody else
sick.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're going to do it, do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't give it to someone else to smoke.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_08]: You said a little bit of psychosis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think a little bit of headache,
nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, stuff that
[SPEAKER_08]: would be described as hidden or mistaken
as other things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually flu-like or cold symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as it gets later, you'll
definitely get like typical mold
[SPEAKER_01]: poisoning, like seizures and very,
very, very, very bad things will happen to
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kidney and liver toxicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: From mycotoxins, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those will wreak havoc on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And powdery mildew is, it's of that type.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of organism that's going to produce those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't worry about it for food
crops very often because it's only leafy
[SPEAKER_01]: parts that get affected by it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most fruits like tomatoes and stuff won't
show the little patches on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like cucumbers or squash that always
get infected, the fruit itself is probably
[SPEAKER_02]: safe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: To consume, not to blast into hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably right in the same trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cucumber resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you get some turps, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even then that's not very strong
quantities because you have to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: large amount of leafy matter infected with
the white patches.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the fruiting body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's a toxin that's systemic that
goes throughout the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, you'll end up with it in your
cucumbers or squash or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: but not much.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we're smoking leafy, leafy
flowers, which accumulate that stuff with
[SPEAKER_01]: freakishly high concentrations itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not the same as a food issue
because it's technically considered
[SPEAKER_01]: non-toxic for food crops, even though they
don't let it ever happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you definitely don't want to be
smoking that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had it on, like you said,
the leafy parts of plants, but we've never
[SPEAKER_02]: actually seen it on the fruit.
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're into the side of the mic like
you're some kind of gangster rapper.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Punk rocker.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've always, since powdery mildew kind
of came around the last few, five,
[SPEAKER_02]: six years seems like, I've wondered about
those late season crops that always get
[SPEAKER_02]: infected with that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've tended to throw a lot of that
stuff in the compost bio.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's probably what you should do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that powdery mildew going to affect his
compost?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to actually put that in the
compost either, they say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a good one to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Microtoxin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured he got hot enough that- And it
doesn't kill the spores, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't actually have to worry about
inhaling the spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's literally the toxins that you're
burning.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be havoc on the mucous
membranes at first, and then it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: make you feel a little weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen some big commercial rooms that I
felt like the spores actually burned my
[SPEAKER_02]: nose.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I know who you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_08]: Possibly.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this dude told me that using a one
micron screen would prevent any of the
[SPEAKER_08]: microtoxins or spores getting into the
hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's completely bullshit because we're
basically juicing the microtoxins right
[SPEAKER_08]: through that screen, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in solution, so you can't filter
them out as if they were solid particles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like the THC is, correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's totally the same thing as salt and
water, unless you actually have a filter
[SPEAKER_01]: that's not even a filter anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call it a semipermeable membrane.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what osmosis uses.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not even a filter anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't filter a dissolved solid out of
a liquid.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that Tony knows a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's warm in here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_08]: It got hot in here today.
[SPEAKER_08]: Man, those taps got to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone's a little slow, I can tell on
the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically, powdery mildew is fucking
terrible, you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you've got powdery mildew on your buds,
don't give that to somebody else.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just smoke that yourself if you're going
to do anything with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't blast it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Please don't blast it.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're a medical marijuana provider and
you are giving powdery mildew buds to sick
[SPEAKER_08]: people, you're the devil.
[SPEAKER_08]: You are anti the movement.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're doing everything wrong.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're making sick people sicker.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're causing more problems than you're
helping.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're the difference between a
cashcropper and a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't be a cashcropper.
[SPEAKER_08]: Be a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm done with that rant.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll stop.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, Ryan, if you listen to the podcast,
I kind of went off on you kind of hard
[SPEAKER_08]: about this the other day.
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_08]: I try to be a leader of the movement and a
lot of people will accept that and I want
[SPEAKER_08]: to speak out about it and make sure that
you know how passionately wrong I feel
[SPEAKER_08]: that it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: I might've been rude.
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're still friends.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll still dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I promised that we would talk about
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys all feel good about the powdery
mildew topic?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for your expertise, Tony.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tony will be good at this nutrient part
too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tony's, I'm not going to call him a pro
level grower.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got a few crops under his belt.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got that chemistry background,
so it really helps him out.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it also kind of kills him.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, guys, we had to take a quick
break, but we are back.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jesse had to dip out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I wish I had a better story for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: He took a dab and turned green.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we had to cut out and get Jesse some
water and get him to the couch.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now, Jesse is chilling on the couch.
[SPEAKER_08]: He'll be all right.
[SPEAKER_08]: He may come back to the show, but I doubt
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: He said, go on without him.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Insert your make fun of Jesse comments
right here.
[SPEAKER_08]: He is a professional, but sometimes a dab
will get you.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he's chilling.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do him some love by this way.
[SPEAKER_08]: This podcast is brought to you
[SPEAKER_08]: by the U.S.
[SPEAKER_08]: Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to make my plants happy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jesse was giving them praise earlier.
[SPEAKER_08]: He said he set up one light with a room
that had an uneven canopy because a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: times your middle plants will grow better
because that's where all the lighting is.
[SPEAKER_08]: He said they evened out within a week or
two.
[SPEAKER_08]: So must be doing something right.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I said, we're going to talk about doing
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was also mentioning that Tony is a
chemistry and organic chemistry major.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a physics nerd.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a computer nerd.
[SPEAKER_08]: But this dude knows a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that his knowledge of science
really helps him when he grows.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I also think it almost kills him when
he grows.
[SPEAKER_08]: Plants are predictable, but plants aren't
science.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have limits.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I see Tony, he's like, I fed them
potassium.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why aren't they potassiuming it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on, do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like, you got to go to bed and you
got to wait like three days and you got to
[SPEAKER_08]: come back and check.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then maybe you'll see what you did.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, I want it now.
[SPEAKER_08]: He thinks he should mix it up and see
explosions for the way plants work.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes it works.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes it does.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's funny watching you be baffled.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know how much you know about science and
organics.
[SPEAKER_08]: And to see you look at me like,
dude, how come?
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just the smallest thing that you
overlooked.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's great seeing you learn like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But sometimes it does slow you down.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes it totally shoots you in the
foot because you don't believe that the
[SPEAKER_08]: plants will do what I think they should do
on their own.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want everything to be the Incredible
Hulk?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: On steroids.
[SPEAKER_08]: On steroids.
[SPEAKER_08]: Rawr.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to talk a little bit about
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was hoping Jesse would be here because
he really has a lot of cool shit to
[SPEAKER_08]: contribute, but I will cover.
[SPEAKER_08]: I will try to, I'll go like, I'll put my
voice really deep.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll turn up the lows on the microphone.
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe it didn't help.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'll turn up my voice real deep and
I'll do Jesse's parts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of what we're going to cover today
will be based on bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a lot easier for a new home
grower to learn what's a good line of
[SPEAKER_08]: bottled newts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Next week I'm going to have a guy named
Sean over.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: It may be two weeks until I have Sean
over.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got to see what happens with the secret
cup.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I should, Sean will be here next week.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe Spence will be here the week after
with the secret cup victory.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I'm hoping for.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sean's going to teach us about organics
and sustainable horticulture.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sean doesn't use, to the best of my
knowledge, Sean doesn't use any hydro
[SPEAKER_08]: store products.
[SPEAKER_08]: But for today's lesson, we're going to
focus on basics.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bottled nutrients are usually reliable and
consistent.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our good friend, Adam, who couldn't be
here tonight, he specifically asked me
[SPEAKER_08]: what he needs to be feeding his plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he also asked what the numbers on the
front of the bottles mean.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think the numbers on the front of the
bottle is a good question and it's a super
[SPEAKER_08]: good spot to start.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll talk about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are three numbers.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you go to the hydro shop and you pick
up almost any fertilizer bottle,
[SPEAKER_08]: there are three numbers on the front.
[SPEAKER_08]: The first number represents nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_08]: The second number represents phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the third number represents potassium.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's NPK.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are known as macronutrients.
[SPEAKER_08]: So a bottle of basic grow nutrients,
like if you grab Botanicure Pure Blend Pro
[SPEAKER_08]: or maybe some Advanced Nutrients Jungle
Juice Grow, the numbers on there are going
[SPEAKER_08]: to be like 325 or 216 or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Each brand is going to be different.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if it says 325, that's what we're going
to work with now is 325.
[SPEAKER_08]: It means there's 3% nitrogen, 2%
phosphorus, and 5% potassium in that
[SPEAKER_08]: nutrient, in that bottle.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the numbers on those bottles tell us
the NPK values of what the NPK values are
[SPEAKER_08]: of the fertilizers we're buying,
but it's up to us to figure out which
[SPEAKER_08]: bottles to use and when to use them and
how much to use.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of the nutrient companies make a
really cool nutrient calculator that you
[SPEAKER_08]: can get at the hydro shop.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of times it's in a little insert
thing like a coupon right next to the
[SPEAKER_08]: brand.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get those.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are always super helpful.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of times Tony will be like,
how much of this nutrient do I use?
[SPEAKER_08]: And since I'm kind of a nerd, I've
happened to have a bunch of those little
[SPEAKER_08]: inserts laying around and I'll just pull
it out and be like, it says this.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I definitely recommend reducing the
recommended dosage to about half of what
[SPEAKER_08]: they say you use.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes two thirds.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can tell.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll talk more about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wrote that part down.
[SPEAKER_08]: So most of the companies make a chart or
also online.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can go online to botanicure.com or
advancednutrients.com.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know they have super great feeding
schedule calculators.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you use a pre-developed recipe from
there, they'll tell you exactly what to
[SPEAKER_08]: use every week.
[SPEAKER_08]: I suggest you reduce the dosage,
like I was saying, to about half.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those companies, they want to sell you
more.
[SPEAKER_08]: They really want you to buy more shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they tell you to use a little bit
extra, like five or 10 milliliters every
[SPEAKER_08]: week adds up to them and to you,
but you don't notice it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your plants won't notice it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they kind of overfeed your plants on
purpose.
[SPEAKER_08]: So reduce what they say.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you see signs of a deficiency,
you can increase your fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you overfeed, you can't correct that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got burnt leaves and angry roots
and your plants look all fucking fried
[SPEAKER_08]: out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I've seen a couple of your plants
do that one time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tony's not afraid to mess with some
plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tony is all about getting in there and
torturing the shit out of his crop.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to talk a lot about pH burns
if we have time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to try to go about 45 to an hour
here, but if we have time for pH,
[SPEAKER_08]: we'll get into it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Something I recommend, and this is part of
what I think Tony shoots himself in the
[SPEAKER_08]: foot with.
[SPEAKER_08]: I recommend that if you're going to use a
brand of bottled nutrients, you stick with
[SPEAKER_08]: the brand until you become experienced and
you can identify deficiencies and
[SPEAKER_08]: problems, which means a few things.
[SPEAKER_08]: First, if you use Botanicare Pure Blend
Pro as a base, I totally recommend using
[SPEAKER_08]: whatever Botanicare Pure Blend Pro
additives you can afford to add,
[SPEAKER_08]: but don't mix stuff from other brands.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that sounds ridiculous,
like brand loyalty or a sales pitch,
[SPEAKER_08]: but I think it's rational with any brand
and I'll explain why.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't mix brands because of,
and Tony will like this, chelation,
[SPEAKER_08]: buffers, and bonding agents versus
organics.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of products have chemicals that make
the products last longer.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some have chemicals that prevent certain
compounds from bonding inside the bottle
[SPEAKER_08]: and ruining the solution, and many of
those chemicals will ruin all of the
[SPEAKER_08]: beneficial compounds in an organic
solution.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tony may correct me on this.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like if I poured some synthetic
nutrient, like if I got almost anything
[SPEAKER_08]: from advanced nutrients, if I poured Big
Bud into a batch of organic compost tea,
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the Big Bud would kill most of the
bioactivity in my compost tea.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Big Bud, especially like
Overdrive, definitely would wreak havoc.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: How about my Mycos?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it just going to destroy my Myco life?
[SPEAKER_01]: Destroy your Mycos and actually it's
probably going to bring things out of
[SPEAKER_01]: solution, like calcium compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they're unavailable to the plant,
they actually create other deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about balance apparently.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: You definitely enforced what I was trying
to say.
[SPEAKER_08]: I sound like I know what I'm talking about
now.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So unless you're sure the product gets
along with other products, you shouldn't
[SPEAKER_08]: be adding two things from different brands
because you could cause problems.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could have everything going for the
first six weeks and then you go and add in
[SPEAKER_08]: some Bud Booster that doesn't match up
with your schedule and it can totally just
[SPEAKER_08]: ruin all the work you've done for the past
veg time plus six weeks of flour.
[SPEAKER_08]: So another reason I stick with one brand
is because as you learn, you need
[SPEAKER_08]: something to be consistent.
[SPEAKER_08]: As many things as you can need to be
consistent.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hard to adapt to changes and identify
problems with too many variables.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like if we minimize the variables,
we can dial in our crops to perfection.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're not truly happy with your
nutrients, you can for sure switch them,
[SPEAKER_08]: but I recommend trying the same brand
while you learn.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I keep talking about it,
but I personally, I like Botanicare.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've used advanced nutrients.
[SPEAKER_08]: I felt like with advanced, I got huge Buds
and everything finished really quickly,
[SPEAKER_08]: but I also feel like everything looked and
smelled and tasted the same.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think there was much variation.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I ran OG Kush, Sour Diesel,
Strawberry Haze, they all kind of had the
[SPEAKER_08]: same advanced nutrients.
[SPEAKER_08]: They all smelled like Nirvana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And advanced, it's actually kind of like
junk food.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the wrong kind of nitrogen that you'd
want for healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look nice, but they're not actually
as healthy as they should be.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't ever think of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: All I could tell is that they were taken
off and for what I paid I could tell I was
[SPEAKER_08]: getting my money's worth.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was getting that extra that they
advertise, but I didn't like the flavor.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when you're growing crops for
yourself, I want the flavor.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want the flavor I want.
[SPEAKER_08]: I grew with Psycho.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did a couple rounds with Psycho.
[SPEAKER_08]: They actually gave me a free box set and I
ran it side by side next to Botanicare.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have a five by five hut next to a
five by five hut.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything is the same.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's in the same room.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I did Psycho on one side, Botanicare
on the other.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Psycho side, everything turned really,
really purple and it was sexy.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was really photogenic Bud.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once again, I didn't like the flavor.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It didn't burn as well and it had a funky
flavor.
[SPEAKER_08]: I used SolSynthetics from Aurora,
excuse me, from Aurora Innovations.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it has a lot of molasses-y type stuff,
a lot of humic stuff, and that made for
[SPEAKER_08]: tasty, tasty buds.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it didn't give me enough harvest and
it didn't get real resiny.
[SPEAKER_08]: It tasted super good, but I didn't get the
harvest I wanted.
[SPEAKER_08]: Humboldt nutrients, that stuff worked
well, but there's a lot of PGRs and things
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to get away from in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like advanced nutrients.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to use a lot of PGRs and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Humboldt did well, but again, I prefer
Botanicare for the flavor.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I like the best.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all about tea.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now it's getting to be all about the teas.
[SPEAKER_08]: The guy that's coming on next week is all
about making super awesome teas.
[SPEAKER_08]: So for my personal, I'll always probably
go back to the Botanicare Pure Blend Pro
[SPEAKER_08]: with all the additives recommended.
[SPEAKER_08]: I also use C Plex from the Organicare
lineup and I'll add some kind of molasses
[SPEAKER_08]: and yucca extract and maybe some
dehydrated coconut water.
[SPEAKER_08]: To my feeding toward the middle of bloom,
but that's our secret.
[SPEAKER_08]: So don't ever say that on a podcast where
people could hear you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually good for beginner growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pile on the yucca.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your error tolerance for temperatures and
a bunch of things.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very good for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of like aloe vera on a sunburn,
except inside.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that sounds weird, but it
definitely works to moisten things up and
[SPEAKER_08]: keep things safe.
[SPEAKER_08]: A good source of yucca extract.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you don't want to just go find yucca
extract and figure out how to use that,
[SPEAKER_08]: Humboldt honey is actually packed with
yucca extract and it's a great product.
[SPEAKER_08]: You need something with molasses and
sugars in it anyway, late in bloom.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_08]: If anybody from Botanicare is listening,
you can send me an email and I'll get you
[SPEAKER_08]: my shipping address and sponsorship info.
[SPEAKER_08]: I read genetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_08]: Check out my feed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Botanicare.
[SPEAKER_08]: I buy a lot of your stuff guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Talk to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Another reason I would stick to one brand
is because doubling up on nutrient brands,
[SPEAKER_08]: you could actually double up on something
you don't want.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could have overlap.
[SPEAKER_08]: There could be too much magnesium in this
one or too much, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_08]: molybdenum in this one.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you don't realize it because they
don't list all that small stuff on every
[SPEAKER_08]: bottle.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you use something from Botanicare,
something from advanced nutrients,
[SPEAKER_08]: you may possibly be overdosing your plant
with something.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so Botanicare is not going to make a
nutrient A with nutrient B that would
[SPEAKER_08]: overlap.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they kind of wouldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: They know that that's in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, guys, my throat's all clogged up
from taking those dabs that killed Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I should say that most of the nutrient
companies make their own mycoproducts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those you can go a little outside the line
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well as a few other things like
enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enzymes.
[SPEAKER_08]: For enzymes, I always recommend the
hygrozyme.
[SPEAKER_08]: And for mycos lately, all of the OGT
products are freaking awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I also like Great White Shark myself.
[SPEAKER_08]: I put those in almost every plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to go the advanced nutrients
route and you want to spend a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: money, that Piranha and Tarantula in the
liquid bottles, it's $183.50 per bottle.
[SPEAKER_08]: But like 10 or 20 mils will give you
explosive roots.
[SPEAKER_08]: Put that shit in your cloner.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you've got an easy cloner, your roots
will push the lid off the cloner.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your plants will get up and walk away.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So once you guys get comfortable and have
a good understanding of your feeding
[SPEAKER_08]: routine, you can add whatever you feel
like you need.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just read the bottles, adjust your PPMs
accordingly, and pay attention to what
[SPEAKER_08]: you're feeding the plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like if you're just read the labels,
like read them, go to the website,
[SPEAKER_08]: find out what's in those products.
[SPEAKER_08]: They should be readily available.
[SPEAKER_08]: If a company doesn't want to tell you
what's in their stuff, I don't want to use
[SPEAKER_08]: it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of how I feel anyway.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wrote down a side note talking about
PPMs.
[SPEAKER_08]: A friend of mine was having problems with
his crop.
[SPEAKER_08]: His leaves were curling up, looking like
goofy fingers.
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it was a light leak during the
dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_08]: He thought it was the genetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody was real confused.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I just burped right into the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody was real confused.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the room was correct.
[SPEAKER_08]: He had good genetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: And after a few days, we realized a
problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: His magnetic ballasts were causing
interference with the PPM and pH meter,
[SPEAKER_08]: and everything was way off.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he's thinking he's balancing out the pH
perfectly, you know, six, five,
[SPEAKER_08]: seven, and he's actually making it 11 or
lower.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's probably going down.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's probably like four, because that low
is probably what made everything curl,
[SPEAKER_08]: is getting it real low.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what I was going to say is try to get
away from your magnetic ballasts.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that when you take readings,
your magnetic ballasts aren't making
[SPEAKER_08]: everything jump up and down.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also take good care of your PPM and pH
meters.
[SPEAKER_08]: People overlook those, and they're super
important.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jesse recommended making the cords as
short as possible in your grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that would definitely help with stuff
like having your PPM meter fluctuate so
[SPEAKER_08]: heavily.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it'll take a couple of weeks,
but his plants will be back on track.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's just a couple of weeks behind.
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll look good.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're talking about nutrients.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a side note I wanted to make sure
to get out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our main goal here with nutrients is to
have the correct amount of nutrients at
[SPEAKER_08]: the right time, to keep the plants at peak
performance without ever overfeeding them
[SPEAKER_08]: and causing nutrient burn or lockouts.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also I wrote down, don't forget to pay
attention to your pH.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also I said, when you see problems
that look like deficiencies, they are
[SPEAKER_08]: often from a pH issue that was overlooked.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're going to push your plants to
perform, you need to have the proper pH.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think 6.5 to 7 is ideal for most
cannabis strains.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to have to adjust to your
room, your environment, and your strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cocoa fiber people, they have a
different range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the regular deep water culture
hydro people, I think they want it down in
[SPEAKER_01]: the five fives.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds about right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of what I talk about is soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a soil, soilist kind of guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most everything I do is in soilist mix,
indoors, under a thousand watt lights.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you'll have to adjust.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I'm saying, everything is about
adapting.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good call.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right on for reminding those people,
or me.
[SPEAKER_08]: So during the veg phase, your plants are
going to want high levels of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_08]: As the plants progress into the flowering
stage, they're going to require much less
[SPEAKER_08]: nitrogen, and they're going to want more
phosphorus and potassium.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to kind of shift into
explaining the nutrients and their
[SPEAKER_08]: functions, which is cool that Tony's here
for this one, because he knows a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: You hear us talk about NPK.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll focus on nitrogen, phosphorus,
and potassium.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go with nitrogen first.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll almost always hear nitrogen first.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of what you breathe is nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an odorless, colorless gas that
constitutes over 75% of the earth's
[SPEAKER_08]: atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_08]: Despite the overwhelming presence of
atmospheric nitrogen, there are only a few
[SPEAKER_08]: kinds of plants in the legume family that
can make use of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Marijuana is not a legume.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it should say cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_08]: I cut and pasted this from the internet.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll give them credit in a minute.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't want to break away from my
focus here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where is the website that I stole this
from?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I don't want to stumble around and
do too many things.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm messing with the computer and getting
distracted.
[SPEAKER_08]: So marijuana is not a legume.
[SPEAKER_08]: So nitrogen must be supplemented.
[SPEAKER_08]: Synthetically produced nitrogen fertilizer
is made in the form of anhydrous ammonia
[SPEAKER_08]: from natural gas.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's what I said, anhydrous
ammonia from natural gas.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anhydrous ammonia is then usually
converted into ammonium nitrate for
[SPEAKER_08]: storage and ease of application.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once granulated, the ammonium nitrate is
ready for use as cost-effective and easy
[SPEAKER_08]: to use plant food.
[SPEAKER_08]: Natural sources of nitrogen are numerous
and include blood meal, manure,
[SPEAKER_08]: bird and bat guano, among many others.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, guys, Sean will be here next
week.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to jump in for a minute.
[SPEAKER_08]: He'll be here next week to discuss this
all-organic method.
[SPEAKER_08]: He calls it organic as fuck.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once you hear about your nutrients being
fed, being made with anhydrous ammonia,
[SPEAKER_08]: it kind of makes you start getting more
interested in that sustainable
[SPEAKER_08]: horticulture stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds kind of weird and extreme,
like some crazy chemistry, but it actually
[SPEAKER_01]: happens in the soil itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little cycle that nitrates,
ammonium, nitrites and actually pure NH3
[SPEAKER_01]: ammonia are converted back and forth by
your mycos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you'll buy a pack of mycos
that'll say nitrogen fixing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: They convert nitrates usually into the
ammoniums.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens in the soil anyway,
but that's actually what makes advanced
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients junk food.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all nitrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to have some ammonium ions in
there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually do exist in the composted
organic stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just produced usually by bacteria,
aerobic decay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tony's got access to all of the ingredient
lists and studies from the colleges
[SPEAKER_08]: because he's a college kid.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's read some great shit and told me some
great things about nutrients, and it's
[SPEAKER_08]: that stuff right there that's golden.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm talking about Sean's coming.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once I read about this stuff, I got kind
of like, I want to go more toward a
[SPEAKER_08]: sustainable way of growing my plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it would be better.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my next step.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can crow.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can breed.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can select phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can identify problems.
[SPEAKER_08]: My game is strong.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I just got to adjust and get more
eco-friendly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Quit using so much electricity and
hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Much love to my HydroShop sponsor.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just got to get away from some of that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was talking about nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because of its crucial role in
photosynthesis, fertilizers high in
[SPEAKER_08]: nitrogen are used during the vegetative
phase of growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nitrogen is key to both chlorophyll and
protein production and used throughout
[SPEAKER_08]: photosynthesis for the conversion of
carbon into sugars and other organic
[SPEAKER_08]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_08]: So grow fertilizers are high in nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're used for rapid growth.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're used to build chlorophyll and
promote a healthy green color,
[SPEAKER_08]: and they improve the volume and health of
plant foliage.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys, if you see your plants looking
pale and yellow, that's your first sign of
[SPEAKER_08]: probably a nitrogen deficiency.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're 35 minutes in.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get through these nutrients at
least.
[SPEAKER_08]: This will be cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should say that the plants, most plants
in general, will intake 80% of all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen they use in a lifetime during the
vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why all your vegetative cannabis
nutrients have a higher nitrogen value.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I usually feed my veg nutrients until
about two weeks into flower so that I'm
[SPEAKER_08]: giving them more nitrogen to have
available.
[SPEAKER_08]: Should I just switch right away?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I've been doing, but mine
turned yellow way too fast.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I'll just keep feeding that next,
that extra two weeks kind of seems to keep
[SPEAKER_08]: them green for the time that I need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's like veganic sources of plant
nitrogen, usually amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those usually, they direct you to use
those up to flush, which I've not figured
[SPEAKER_01]: out why, but it's the good nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Veganics is way different.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've grown a veganic crop.
[SPEAKER_08]: With some veganic nutrients I was given,
and it had the flavor.
[SPEAKER_08]: It definitely had serious flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, even if you use a cotton seed or
soybean meal, those are very high and
[SPEAKER_01]: weird organic types of nitrogens,
usually amino acids and proteins.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why all these organic guys are
getting great results.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're using actually naturally occurring
nitrogen sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have to have a high, highly active
mycosphere there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of bacterias and rhizomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to be using- I can't wait for
Sean to come.
[SPEAKER_08]: Listen to the next episode with Sean.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll love it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll love it.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk a little bit about phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_08]: Phosphorus is a volatile and reactive
element, which is why it is probably never
[SPEAKER_08]: found in its pure elemental form in
nature.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because of its volatility, fertilizer
packaging is actually showing a measure of
[SPEAKER_08]: its oxide, P205.
[SPEAKER_08]: Phosphorus is commonly refined from stone
called phosphatite or mined from guano
[SPEAKER_08]: islands, comprised of primarily bird and
bat droppings.
[SPEAKER_08]: A common biomass of source of phosphorus
is found in the ground bone, also known as
[SPEAKER_08]: bone meal.
[SPEAKER_08]: Phosphorus basically, bloom foods are
higher in phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_08]: Phosphorus improves blood production.
[SPEAKER_08]: Phosphorus aids in root development and
it's involved in oil and glucose
[SPEAKER_08]: production in the end of your blooming
cycle.
[SPEAKER_08]: So boost those up just like we did with
the nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nitrogen starts to drop down and
that's when the phosphorus goes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then towards the middle end of flower,
you want lots and lots of K.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want a very, very high last number.
[SPEAKER_08]: K.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk about K.
[SPEAKER_08]: Potassium.
[SPEAKER_08]: Potassium is an alkali metal that reacts
violently with water and oxidizes quite
[SPEAKER_08]: rapidly when exposed to air.
[SPEAKER_08]: This unstable nature requires that it be
added to fertilizers in the form of
[SPEAKER_08]: potassium compounds known as potash.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not all forms of potash are suitable for
plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like phosphorus, potassium is mined from
mineral-laden ore.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like N and P, potassium, which is K,
is a key component in the metabolic
[SPEAKER_08]: functions of plants and plays a large role
in the production of proteins and
[SPEAKER_08]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Potassium also helps strengthen the
marijuana plant's immune system.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to correct that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cannabis plant's immune system,
which helps the plants cope with
[SPEAKER_08]: environmental stresses, including insects
and diseases.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bloom formulated fertilizers often include
increased levels of potassium because it
[SPEAKER_08]: helps improve flower quality.
[SPEAKER_08]: So potassium is found in both grow and
bloom fertilizers because Tony was saying
[SPEAKER_08]: that it's good towards the end of veg.
[SPEAKER_08]: It helps the plant's immune system and it
increases flower quality.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll see it in most of your bloom
boosters.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be real high in potassium.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're looking for a bloom booster
and a bud hardener, that last number on
[SPEAKER_08]: the bottle, that's the one you're looking
at.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So would you agree with me that that's the
basics of the NPK?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to start high in nitrogen and
then end very low and then start mid to
[SPEAKER_01]: low potassium and end very, very high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the phosphorus kind of like goes
in like a little mountain hump.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some plants I feel like you almost
can't give them too much phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a timing thing actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feed them a bunch of it right as they're
going into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I noticed the buds have
naturally stopped swelling up,
[SPEAKER_01]: I dose them with quite a bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then their little metabolism kicks
back on for like one more week.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you kick a lot of potassium in them,
it keeps them moving.
[SPEAKER_08]: It definitely keeps them from slowing
down.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your plants don't get as lazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll talk a little more specifically
about when to feed things to our plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: When the plants are young, we kind of
covered this, but when the plants are
[SPEAKER_08]: young, they don't require as much
realization.
[SPEAKER_08]: I focus on root building when the plants
are young.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mycos are your friend and enzymes are too.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've talked about mycos and enzymes on
the show before.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll come back to that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once we get all the basics covered,
that's your OGT and your hygrozyme if you
[SPEAKER_08]: guys are looking for products.
[SPEAKER_08]: Use them just like they say on the bottle.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are perfect.
[SPEAKER_08]: Small plants want nitrogen to grow strong.
[SPEAKER_08]: A little bit of phosphorus will help them
build roots and grow vigorously.
[SPEAKER_08]: A little potassium will keep them healthy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your basic veg nutrients probably have
enough NPK to get you through your veg
[SPEAKER_08]: phase.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you veg for long periods, you may need
to add some calcium magnesium.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's something that larger plants will
start running out of.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk a little bit about CalMag while
we're here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Calcium and magnesium are what are known
as secondary nutrients.
[SPEAKER_08]: Calcium is a big part of the cell
structure and cellular growth.
[SPEAKER_08]: Calcium stimulates enzymes that build
strong roots and cell walls.
[SPEAKER_08]: Magnesium is essential to absorb light
energy.
[SPEAKER_08]: If your plants are slow and lazy,
they may be experiencing a magnesium
[SPEAKER_08]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's certain types of yellowing
between the veins.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's magnesium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Magnesium is actually what makes
chlorophyll green.
[SPEAKER_08]: A little bit of Humega from Organicare
will speed your plants up when they start
[SPEAKER_08]: getting lazy like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in the beginning, you need nitrogen,
a little phosphorus and a little
[SPEAKER_08]: potassium.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're looking for big roots,
definitely add some type of mycos or root
[SPEAKER_08]: inoculant.
[SPEAKER_08]: I always brag about the OGT and great
white shark together.
[SPEAKER_08]: That shit works great for your roots.
[SPEAKER_08]: You get big fat white roots.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you feed OGT and great white shark
along with your mix, your regular feed
[SPEAKER_08]: schedule in the morning, right when the
plants come on, if you go in about two
[SPEAKER_08]: hours later, most of your leaves will be
pointing straight up and they're praying
[SPEAKER_08]: and thanking you.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're saying, holy shit, I love that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: They love that shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: If your plants get a little too big and
fed, you're going to need CalMag.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once you enter the flower phase,
totally like we talked about, reduce the
[SPEAKER_08]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_08]: The first two weeks of flower won't show
you much.
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep the plants fed and happy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I use my grow-based nutrient until week
three of flower like I was talking about.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like it keeps them nicely
nitrogened up until the end of flower.
[SPEAKER_08]: I add some CalMag and put some potassium
silicates in.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, some type of kelp at week three.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's CalMag, potassium silicates,
and kelp at week three.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll add liquid karma and sweet at week
three also.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you start week three of flower,
you can drop out most of the nitrogen and
[SPEAKER_08]: really start pumping up the P and K.
[SPEAKER_08]: Week four, I do the same thing as week
three.
[SPEAKER_08]: We should be low on nitrogen and pumping
up the P and K.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd add some kelp and a small amount of
molasses by now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would also add some enzymes to my mix.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd be running the whole botanic air feed
chart.
[SPEAKER_08]: Week five is where I really pound my
plants with food.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think day 30 is where they're really
ready for sugars and boosters.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's when they're really ready to get
hammered with a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've dropped the nitrogen by now and I'm
feeding heavy doses of P and K.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd be adding my bloom boosters and lots
of molasses and sugars.
[SPEAKER_08]: CalMag would be super important for the
next couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Enzymes and kelp would also be helpful for
big tasty buds.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think kelp, I use a lot of C plex.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think all that kelp really adds to the
stink and the density.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some flavors, if they have that foot,
cushy, skunk smell, that stink,
[SPEAKER_08]: it kind of makes them come out a little
bit better if you add a lot of kelp.
[SPEAKER_08]: You should add some potassium silicates
for thick branches at this time,
[SPEAKER_08]: like week five, week 30-ish.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe you could have put those in at week
four, but if you've got good healthy
[SPEAKER_08]: plants, I think they're cool on week five.
[SPEAKER_08]: You just need them to build those branches
up a little bit while the buds grow super
[SPEAKER_08]: thick because they're going to start
falling over.
[SPEAKER_08]: Week five is basically your bloom-based
nutrients, lots of blood, blood boosters,
[SPEAKER_08]: sugars, enzymes, potassium silicates,
and kelp.
[SPEAKER_08]: Week six will basically be the same thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Focus on your blood boosters and sugars
and get that stuff up there as high as you
[SPEAKER_08]: can without burning the plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Put a lot of molasses in there,
a lot of P and K products, and some
[SPEAKER_08]: enzymes in there to keep all of that stuff
moving.
[SPEAKER_08]: You do the same thing up to however long
you need to go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Week seven, week eight, usually don't feed
after week nine.
[SPEAKER_08]: You should start flushing by week eight.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most plants aren't going to go more than
10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're growing a plant that takes more
than 10 weeks, I hope your experience and
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope all of this stuff already makes
sense to you because that's going to be a
[SPEAKER_08]: bitch for you to grow an 11-week plant
without this knowledge.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once you get to week eight and you've
gotten done feeding these plants and
[SPEAKER_08]: keeping them happy and healthy,
you need to flush.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've just talked about how much stuff we
poured into these plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you need to spend at least 10 to 14
days with nothing but water in these
[SPEAKER_08]: plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: On Monday, however much, if you've got a
five-gallon pot, pour water through it
[SPEAKER_08]: until that shit's running through,
until your tray is almost full,
[SPEAKER_08]: until you're worried about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have a way to get that water out of
the tray, that's ideal.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get that water out of there and let those
plants sit until they're almost dry and do
[SPEAKER_08]: the same thing all over again.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do that for the next 10 to 14 days.
[SPEAKER_08]: Try to get three or four cycles of just
clean water through there so that you can
[SPEAKER_08]: push out all the nitrogen, the phosphorus,
the potassium, the calcium, the magnesium,
[SPEAKER_08]: the mycos that we just put in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to clean your soil out.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to get all that stuff out of
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you have really clean sorts of
molasses, you could use that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your first flush watering, quite a bit of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sugars displace salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why all of the clear X that they'll
sell you, clear X is just a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: different types of sugars, displaces salt,
but it feeds all of your mycos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, it feeds all of them,
boosts their colonization up, and they end
[SPEAKER_01]: up eating any residual food that's left.
[SPEAKER_01]: They eat a bunch of it for you,
like little garbage disposals.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: He just said sugars displace salts,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of the nutrients you're feeding are
salts, and your plants are filled with
[SPEAKER_08]: salts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Salts don't taste so good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sugar, sounds like it tastes good,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: If you put some sugars in there when
you're flushing, it'll push the salts out
[SPEAKER_08]: of your plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll also clean up the soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll break it up, kind of.
[SPEAKER_08]: It goes in there and stirs it around,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and feeds your hungry mycos.
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is always awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to go to a website.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is where I got a lot of the
information about just a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: information from this show.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called marijuanagrowershq.com is
where I got a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I also got some guidance from the
Botanicare website.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kind of looking at their feed charts
to keep in mind what I would feed every
[SPEAKER_08]: week because I don't have my own feed
chart in my hand because it's in the grow
[SPEAKER_08]: spaces.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't carry that around, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a shout out to the people that
made the charts easy for me to figure out,
[SPEAKER_08]: and they made NPK easy for everyone to
understand.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we should stop there on the
nutrient lessons because we're 45 minutes
[SPEAKER_08]: in, 47 minutes, and I think if we go any
further, we'll end up running over an
[SPEAKER_08]: hour, and you potheads run out of
attention span at 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can tell how long you listen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Stitcher tells me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tony can definitely tell how long you're
listening because he runs all my web
[SPEAKER_08]: stats.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've had about 5,000 listens on the past
few episodes, which is remarkable.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to thank all 5,000 of you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope all 5,000 of you continue to
listen.
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems like it's about time to wrap up
the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't feel like I have much more to
cover.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where was that page that I had my topics?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I covered them all.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to say we did because I can't
find the damn paper, so we had to have
[SPEAKER_08]: covered all the topics.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, the Cannabis Cup was over
Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Vault Genetics, DNA Genetics,
big shout out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to Crockett.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember exactly who won
everything, but big shout out to everybody
[SPEAKER_08]: that took home prizes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope everybody has a safe trip home.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Cannabis Cup got raided and they shut
it down, so they had to move everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was no big smokeout expo.
[SPEAKER_08]: All that they did have was the concerts
that were supposed to happen, so I hope
[SPEAKER_08]: everybody got home.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope nobody got in any trouble.
[SPEAKER_08]: So now that the show is over, yes,
the show is over.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that the show is over, dude,
Tony, thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was good finally having you on the
show, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a minute.

Igriculture podcast, the podcast all about
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis news, education, and culture.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're a new grower, a professional
grower, a longtime cannabis consumer,
[SPEAKER_08]: a brand new smoker, or even someone who's
just curious about the current state of
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis, this
[SPEAKER_08]: one of my friends is the podcast for you.
Thanks again for joining us.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm solvent-less, it's delicious,
and Jesse did not die.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: My blood sugar's correct today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was worried about coming on here
with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a big BHO smoker, so... I didn't
even ask that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to ask that.
[SPEAKER_08]: As the show progressed, I had a BHO
question for you, so I was going to see if
[SPEAKER_08]: you're a dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up with Spencer, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the same sense, I was pampered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you smoke his chatter,
you can't really go to smoke in a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was just like, screw it, I'll make
some ice wax.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you smoke live resin?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had the pleasure of trying it a
couple of times from his personal stash,
[SPEAKER_00]: and good gracious, it is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to steal some of his tech on that
one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Terpy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Terpy, slurpy.
[SPEAKER_08]: By the time this episode airs,
in my mind, I feel like Spencer will have
[SPEAKER_08]: won the Secret Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's a safe assumption.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's there now.
[SPEAKER_08]: The competition actually happens Sunday
night.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the judging happens.
[SPEAKER_08]: So by the time this episode comes out,
he will be the champion of the Secret Cup,
[SPEAKER_08]: and I can reveal what was entered.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was White Widow, grown by Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, oh, no, no, you can't.
[SPEAKER_08]: People look at me like, you can't say
that, but this won't come out.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is now that everybody knows now.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was White Widow, grown by Rasta Jeff of
iRegenetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the cut, Spence gave me the cut a
while back.
[SPEAKER_08]: I crossed that cut to Grateful Dog,
and I actually made Capelton with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that White Widow, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: It grows like a boss.
[SPEAKER_08]: It kicks out multiple donkey dicks,
like menorahs of donkey dicks.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I hope that does well for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good luck, brother.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you brought home a trophy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Either way, if he won or not, I plan to
get him here on the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: He might be the episode after this,
his schedule pending.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's up to him.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's invited.
[SPEAKER_08]: He knows he's welcome anytime.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully we can get him.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out, Spence.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to Big D.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to Jerry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to Jeremy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out everyone involved with the
Secret Cup.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll do a wrap up on that one in the next
show.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do an ad real quick.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got to pay some bills before we get too
far.

[SPEAKER_08]: Jesse's pointing out the new E-nail that
we got.
[SPEAKER_08]: My buddy Giddy up in Emotec sent me the
sweetest brand new G-nail.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It works like a boss if you're in the
market for a G-nail, an E-nail that stays
[SPEAKER_08]: hot at the perfect temp, gives you fat
rips all the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Check out the G-nail.

[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to save you a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're buying a NanoLux Lite,
you're going to save quite a few bucks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jesse just looked at me like, we didn't
think of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got them in stock now too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got enough to get going there in the
store.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just saw you visualize the shelf.
[SPEAKER_08]: He looked up at my wall as if the shelf
would be there and he could see it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think he counted them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's, how many is there or
if we're going to get the order by the
[SPEAKER_02]: time the show shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, there's two different numbers going
through my head there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Either way, they will get your NanoLux
lighting needs taken care of.
[SPEAKER_08]: They look to be quality lights.
[SPEAKER_08]: Much love to all the sponsors.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys, thanks for helping us out.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're interested in sponsoring the
show, email me.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hygroculture at hotmail.com and we'll
get it going.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I've got a couple of things I got to
say.
[SPEAKER_08]: Big shout out to Angela, Adam,
and Mike.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, you guys trimmed for seven hours
last night.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would have gotten nuts without it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sean just looked over and saw the trimmed
pots and shook his head.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are big pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been at it for like a week trimming
by myself.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know good trimmers.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you need them, I'll give you their
numbers.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're yours.
[SPEAKER_08]: They need money.
[SPEAKER_08]: You just got to pay them decently.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a big shout out to those guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: They helped me out trim and I could not
have got through it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also a big, huge shout out to Hanky B.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hanky B gave me some live resin to dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was hanging at his house and as I left,
he goes, here man, take some of this.
[SPEAKER_08]: He just gave me like a gram of live res.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make sure you follow him on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's hankyb11.
[SPEAKER_08]: He told me to make sure I say that because
he gave me a hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a big shout out to Hank.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll skip some shout outs for now.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's enough.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get onto the meat of the show here.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got a guy that does all kinds of
organics and we've been talking about a
[SPEAKER_08]: lot of grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I guess the first question to jump
right into it, dude, if we just want to
[SPEAKER_08]: get down to it, do you want to tell me all
about organic as fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, organic as a fuck is just a hashtag
we started using.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was created by Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse actually started the hashtag and
stole it off his page.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, the idea is that all organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't like the idea of any bottled
fertilizers, synthetic nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically pesticides, anything with
mineral salts, MAP and DAP.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is to create a clean product,
food grade, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably buy half of the products I use
at our local natural grocers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, really big emphasis on growing style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most growers tend to focus on flour where
we focus on the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel a lot of stuff is lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're just focusing on weight,
high vegetative yields, quit flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: times, you're just losing a lot of money,
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're just losing so much in that
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then hurting the environment and a lot
of other people.
[SPEAKER_08]: That part is what's really got me
interested.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to learn a lot from you to maybe
shift my grow toward this style.
[SPEAKER_08]: And my reasoning is the sustainability.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got a kid and she's 11 now and I keep
thinking about the stuff that I hear.
[SPEAKER_08]: I read about what they're making my
nutrients out of.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I'm thinking about, I toured a
large grow facility that runs a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: hydro and they have lots of water that has
to be flushed out as waste.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thought, where does that go?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going back to our municipal water
supply and being filtered out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when you get water out of the sink,
that's what we're drinking.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then really that stuff, the past few
years has had me think, and I want to get
[SPEAKER_08]: more sustainable.
[SPEAKER_08]: And no offense to the hydro shops,
but I love them because they help us out.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we don't need to be paying over-marked
prices for a botanic air bottle because it
[SPEAKER_08]: says botanic air.
[SPEAKER_08]: When Sean can teach us how to take that
chicken shit and seabird guano and make
[SPEAKER_08]: something that we can, one day the end of
the world is coming and you can't go to
[SPEAKER_08]: the hydro shop then.
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sean's going to outgrow us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sean's going to outgrow all of us when
that day comes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do feel hypocritical sometimes because I
use very few products from our store as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But see your store, it has the option.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ours is a little different than most I
like to think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was pretty blown away when I first
walked in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's coming from a guy who
absolutely hates hydro stores.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're doing it mostly out of the
organics for the clean product for the
[SPEAKER_08]: food grade.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm interested more for the
sustainability.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's both a great reason to do
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing that got my attention right off
the bat, you said you don't use any
[SPEAKER_08]: pesticides or non-organic pesticides.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really curious, and I bet the
listeners are too, how do you keep bugs
[SPEAKER_08]: out of your crop without some nuclear
attack right at the beginning of the fall
[SPEAKER_08]: here?
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody I know got three types of bugs
at once.
[SPEAKER_08]: Three letters, IPM.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I guess what that means?
[SPEAKER_08]: Ladies and gentlemen, integrated pest
management.
[SPEAKER_08]: Please write that down.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's important.
[SPEAKER_08]: We will talk about that a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be a glossary term that
you need to mark.
[SPEAKER_08]: IPM, integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prevention is the only guaranteed form of
pest control, 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't want to deal with pests,
then you have to start a program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that starts with a nice organic base.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to start out with things high in
chitin, insect frass, crab meal,
[SPEAKER_00]: things, neem cake, all of that into the
soil mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you want to start off on a regiment
of silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Aloe vera.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to strengthen the plant,
help it build its cell walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you need to build its immune
system so it can take care of itself.
[SPEAKER_08]: So throw away the bottle of potassium
silicates and use the aloe vera and the...
[SPEAKER_08]: What was the other one that you said that
I felt would really build the cell walls?
[SPEAKER_00]: The silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silica is just such an underutilized thing
in growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure both of you guys can
contest to that in synthetics or hydro
[SPEAKER_00]: organics.
Build cell walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all the fiber growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stronger your leaf wall is,
the stronger it's going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: stand up to attack.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you use to get silica in organics?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of different options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, there's thousands of different
options on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium silica is probably the number
one most common.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good one to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most organic companies sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally use silica derived from
diatomite through the majority of my
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium silica, though, does have its
place from my clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, latent flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do prefer potassium silica a little bit
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the stuff that's in desiccant
packs?
[SPEAKER_02]: In your box of shoes?
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounds like it looks like a familiar
word.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that I'm thinking about that,
it looks like the same word on there,
[SPEAKER_08]: but I can't promise you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it says on the side of those
little packs.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_08]: It says desiccant pack on there,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it says potassium silica.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wouldn't surprise me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all very common stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the diatomite, the silica derived
from diatomite is basically diatomaceous
[SPEAKER_00]: earth, which you're probably more familiar
with.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got a rough texture.
[SPEAKER_08]: It kind of cuts up the bugs if they try to
get through.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like walking on glass for a bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your plants never get sprayed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually, they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I foliar spray every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably overkill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I foliar spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every girl likes to spend time in their
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can find a way to do it,
go for it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my ways to spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do break it down into regimens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Dragonfly Earth Medicine with
their natural mystic teas of foliar
[SPEAKER_00]: sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're soil inoculates and other herbal
inoculates, but that's a big part of my
[SPEAKER_00]: spray regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Homemade compost teas, FPJs, FFJs,
so fermented fruit juices, fermented plant
[SPEAKER_00]: juices that I make myself.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're actually spraying that on your
plants?
[SPEAKER_08]: Spraying that on the plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: How late into flower would you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually don't go past week four or five,
just like a traditional spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though it's organic, things just tend
to stick around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cause problems going past week
four or five, I assume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially everything that I use is very
sugary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fruit juices and plant juices and
everything's got molasses.
[SPEAKER_08]: He brought some nugs, you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to say that I was a hater of
organics, but I feel he stood up for
[SPEAKER_08]: himself before anybody even mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_08]: He said, I brought this to show you that
it's dense and it's odorifice and it's
[SPEAKER_08]: covered in trichomes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's all of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: The trichomes are actually real,
they're not tall.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't stick off the bud that he
showed me real far, but they're compacted.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're everywhere all over that nugget.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even between where the two little buds
touch on that branch, they're between
[SPEAKER_08]: there.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got resin everywhere on that.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the organics do work.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can see the proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do some consulting on the side,
but I'm actually working with a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out Blood Diamond Extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really killing the game right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out your consulting company,
too, if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Rocky Mountain Natural Farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check us out on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow them, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these guys, they're making BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny, you have your little meme
on the internet of says he grows vegan and
[SPEAKER_00]: can only smoke BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm pretty sure there's plenty of guys
out there who will back me on this one
[SPEAKER_00]: saying organics produce better hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel the trichomes more fully developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your membrane is more intact.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get that mush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it a lot, especially when making the
ice wax.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, this is some stuff that's
locally grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I smoked this the other night.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of your buddies had some of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually made it for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it's organically grown,
but in the sense that you probably went to
[SPEAKER_00]: the store and bought some organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Organic soup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can look at this one.
[SPEAKER_08]: It still has a nice smell.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of this, all the list, it kind of
loses the odor, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_08]: and it's still got that dank smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I believe that maybe it's degrading a
little quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, check the quality of that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like this.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like this one a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then check that one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I hit this one.
[SPEAKER_08]: This one is tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who did you say made this?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was made by Trichome Heavy Extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Jibs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And grown by Growing Kush One Mile High.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out Rob, who's just killing the game
right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I walked into the first cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody knew who iRegenetics was.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hadn't put my face on Instagram yet,
and I had my shirt on.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Growing Kush One Mile High spotted me
right away.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he goes, dude, you're iRegenetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And took a picture with me and posted it
to Instagram.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now my face was out.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what did it.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what put my face on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's when I was like, well, I'm the tall
guy with dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a, he's a very humble dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to get your genetics out
there, get him to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kills it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: At Growing Kush One Mile High,
email me, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting a seed tag.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some stuff should be ready.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some stuff should be ready here in a
couple of weeks, if everything goes well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think that you were, I'm going to
kind of back loop here.
[SPEAKER_08]: You said that the trichomes have a better,
the trichome heads have a better casing
[SPEAKER_08]: from organics.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think that it's because we're using
what the plant actually wants instead of
[SPEAKER_08]: feeding it junk food out of a bottle?
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel those synthetic approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, junk food is just such an
appropriate term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your buds are going to get denser.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get fatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that necessarily mean they're any
better?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only better for your wallet.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're fortunate enough to be in an
industry or at a point in this industry
[SPEAKER_00]: where maybe that doesn't matter as much
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that people aren't all obsessed
with hitting, you know, seven pounds per
[SPEAKER_00]: light, we can focus a little bit more on
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: What stream was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was from BC.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not very sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were trimming last night and there was
one plant and that's a perfect example.
[SPEAKER_08]: One plant kicked out donkey dicks the size
of my arms.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the Girl Scout cookies had little
popcorn, but there was as much resin on
[SPEAKER_08]: that little popcorn of Girl Scout cookies
as there was spread amongst that entire
[SPEAKER_08]: other plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was so dank.
[SPEAKER_08]: That little cookies plant is just coated.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd rather grow more of those.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I didn't have picky patients,
if my patients weren't demanding of the
[SPEAKER_08]: grateful dog and other strains,
I'd grow all cookies just because the
[SPEAKER_08]: resin it puts out.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd grow cookies, yeti, and SFV.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: There'd be some grateful dog in there,
but I'd definitely have like a 36 light
[SPEAKER_08]: room of just cookies.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cookies.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cookies.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I may, I kind of want to mention things,
but I don't want to say too much.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am in the process of possibly taking on
a bad-ass position running 227 lights.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: If everything works out within the next
month, I will be in there growing under
[SPEAKER_08]: 227 gavitas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a little stoked.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all hydro tables.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So try better trichome heads because of
organics.
[SPEAKER_08]: Does the aloe vera have anything to do
with that, you think?
[SPEAKER_08]: The same way it makes my skin more supple
and doesn't burn under the sun or under
[SPEAKER_08]: the grow light.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can really go into the
properties of aloe and yucca and the
[SPEAKER_00]: saponin and all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 30 minutes worth of conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But bottom line is, it increases the
health of your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silica, aloe, coconut water, those are the
bases outside of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad you say that because I preach
those products other than the silica.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm always about aloe and coconut water.
[SPEAKER_08]: I teach a lot of people that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a necessity.
[SPEAKER_08]: I drink coconut water myself and I feel
amazing when I drink it.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the style of gardening that I use,
I like the idea that me and my plants
[SPEAKER_00]: share the same food.
[SPEAKER_08]: The more I grow and the more I evolve into
this, I think my plants... I was a
[SPEAKER_08]: vegetarian before I grew.
[SPEAKER_08]: I took decent care of myself, but I think
learning about the plant biology has made
[SPEAKER_08]: me take better care of myself.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's influenced my shopping when I go
to Vitamin Cottage or whatever grocery
[SPEAKER_08]: store I hit.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Jesse has done it too.
[SPEAKER_08]: His organic practices have influenced my
shopping and my eating a little bit,
[SPEAKER_08]: which in turn has affected my growing
because now you're here to teach me how to
[SPEAKER_08]: be more healthy, more sustainable.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I see it going full circle.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a passion there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like people maybe put a little bit
too much emphasis on the switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you're running soilless and
you're running botanic care, you're almost
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just scared, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: My patients love what I do and I've got...
A little love even more, I promise.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got Grateful Dog grown to perfection
with the way I do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can get it that way with a few
strains, but it's a big jump for me to
[SPEAKER_08]: just go change.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I may do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to write down what you do and
kind of...
[SPEAKER_00]: People will probably disagree with me on
this, but I don't think you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: lose yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I swear up and down that this whole
organics yields less is just a
[SPEAKER_00]: misconception in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a sales pitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, you do have people... It's
a different approach than traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got guys out there who've been
doing hydro or soilless mixes for years,
[SPEAKER_00]: switching to super soils and burning their
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all organics doesn't yield anything,
but it reflects a lot on the grower also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think somebody like you could definitely
just take off with it, especially with
[SPEAKER_00]: your experience with additives.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: With organics, you start a base.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like to water never or
water every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't use anything but water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me personally, I like to water never.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of your style now where
you're giving it... I don't know all the
[SPEAKER_00]: product name, but you're giving them
silica and you're giving them yucca and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're giving them everything that I am
just... Just in a liquid bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing it the lazy way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know how most of that stuff is
made is it's a compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so they make like a compost tea
and then they basically they'll arrest
[SPEAKER_00]: fermentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they stop and kill all the living
organisms in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run it through a protein skimmer,
bottle it up and then sell it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just cut out the middle, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it yourself.
[SPEAKER_08]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: By the summer, guys, we should all be
making our own newts.
[SPEAKER_08]: When it's warm and we're in Colorado,
I'm not going out in the backyard and
[SPEAKER_08]: doing it this week, but I got a garage.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I had some space by the summer,
we'll get it going.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll all be grown organic.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get away.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have to support the hydro shops.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go buy the organics there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get the stuff that's in the box,
the blood meal, the bone meal things.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're doing that, get your worm
castings and stuff, whatever you eat
[SPEAKER_08]: locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to Hygro and make sure that when you're
mixing your soil, talk to Jesse about that
[SPEAKER_00]: because he can fill you in on the whole
bone meal and blood meal thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jesse loves to talk to people at Hygro.
[SPEAKER_08]: He loves to just stand there and get paid
to talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's better than advanced, but you know,
bone meal and blood meal can be approved
[SPEAKER_02]: upon as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this goes back to the...
[SPEAKER_00]: The veganics we were kind of talking about
before the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: By no means do I claim to be a veganic
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use a hashtag called Beyond Veganics to
kind of poke fun at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for the simple fact, vegan growing is
kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like vegans are, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you know someone's a vegan?
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry, they'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really how it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: These veganic growers, they're using just
bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, it's just plain and
simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're not, they're really
depriving their plants of certain things
[SPEAKER_00]: they could be using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earthworm castings, for example,
like I know people... Hey, there's a nice
[SPEAKER_02]: little shout out you can get right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Jay, Rocky Mount earthworm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Jesse uses it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're super high quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is killing the game right now,
dedicated his life to making castings for
[SPEAKER_00]: people like me and Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard a lot of good things.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a customer of my store and you
use earthworm castings, ask me for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, please do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as a organic grower,
I've been in Colorado for about two years
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before then I grew... Is that all I've
known you, bros?
[SPEAKER_00]: Two years?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only been two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems like it's been a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, so, you know, I have a degree in
horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from North Carolina, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back there I grew also.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was organically small.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I've been doing teas and soil
mixes for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming out here really opened my eyes to
the fact that, you know, you think you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to come out to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think you're going to grow organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think it's this big popular thing,
but it's all about money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, Jay, I met Jay and then he
had these high quality castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never turned back, met him probably
within a month of being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using his castings ever since.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does all testings on his stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's super high quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really... He actually posted
some today, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and that's really the key to...
Basically what I do is my castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plain and simple, everybody wants to
know how do I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Jay's castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without a microbial inoculate,
not microbial source, I couldn't do what I
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people source, you know,
Riggler's or castings from stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can make your own compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably the best way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your own worm castings is probably the
best way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, a lot of people,
I call it green washing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go out and they buy something because
it looks organic or it looks like it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, going to be... All natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this environmental friendly product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these companies are preying on the
consumer just like they would in any
[SPEAKER_00]: other, you know, organic companies aren't
any nicer than synthetic companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a company right now, for example,
that loves to kick out this... They throw
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers at people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, your average grower doesn't
really understand how these work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for example, like Jesse was saying,
Jay actually posted something earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: about the worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, I wanted to bring this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, for example, so you've got a
company out there who's throwing this
[SPEAKER_00]: number around like 30,000 plus micro,
you know, living microbes in your tea and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can use it and multiply it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it sounds amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you read Jay's test and it's like
6.9 million protozoa in one gram of
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in one pound, that's over 3 billion
protozoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's before you multiply it in your
brewer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to everybody out there that's using
these products, you know, these sales
[SPEAKER_00]: pitches, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still any to shake.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting seeds and stems.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're... You think you're
getting a leg up, but really you're paying
[SPEAKER_00]: for an overpriced brewer and somebody to
put stuff in a bag for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you're paying when the
bottle... It's a lot like clothes.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're paying for the label.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're paying for that Nike symbol,
that botanical symbol, that advanced
[SPEAKER_08]: nutrients logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so shout out to Jay.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's doing it big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only worm castings, he can source
a lot of things that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: grow stores can't get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse can probably attend to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of things that you're just
not going to be able to source.
[SPEAKER_02]: He approaches it a little differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: And once you get to a certain scale,
it's time to adjust from being a garage,
[SPEAKER_08]: basement, attic grower to actually being a
horticulturalist and setting up a grow and
[SPEAKER_08]: doing horticulture.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of what it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what Jay's more aimed for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got an email up there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he can get whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's a weird question.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to feed botanic hair.
[SPEAKER_08]: Will it kill my neem meal if I put it in
my soil before I mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: The only reason you really have to be
careful mixing synthetics and organics is
[SPEAKER_00]: you can really throw off your micro herd.
[SPEAKER_00]: You feed too much of something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your fungus is going to feed at a faster
rate than your bacteria, which will kill
[SPEAKER_00]: your bacteria out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then your fungus will actually start to
pull things from the plant if it's not in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a balancing act.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of people I've seen on
Instagram who are just absolutely killing
[SPEAKER_00]: the balancing act with the synthetics and
organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would never recommend it to anybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's something we talked about in the
last shows.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, stay away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you were just extremely well versed
in what you do, I would highly recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: staying away from running synthetics and
organics at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a guy that mints his cocoa
solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's running full-blown general
hydroponics and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: These probiotic guys now, I've seen a lot
of them running cocoa.
[SPEAKER_08]: Probiotic Farmers' Alliance is getting
crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's killing me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think everybody at this table knows
there's one grower.
[SPEAKER_08]: He runs organics all the way until about
week six.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then he starts just pummeling with
hammerhead and all kinds of ridiculous
[SPEAKER_08]: PGRs just to make them explode.
[SPEAKER_08]: He said that gives it the flavor.
[SPEAKER_08]: To each his own?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's his grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: He can do what he wants in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just don't sell it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard they didn't make that stuff
anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, they don't, but I know- It's
called Bushmaster or something.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are two or three bottles on the
shelf at Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you use hammerhead, dude, I don't use
it anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did use it in the past.
[SPEAKER_08]: When I was a new grower, I tried every
brand and I tried hammerhead.
[SPEAKER_08]: That shit made my buds larger.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll say it.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're an advanced nutrients grower or
a hydro farmer and you want to clean that
[SPEAKER_08]: shit off the shelf at Jesse's shop,
go get it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's $107 a bottle.
[SPEAKER_08]: Please.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll make you a deal for a whole bunch of
advanced nutrients stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Advanced is on really good sale right now
at Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you listen to the Hygro Culture Show.
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of advanced, I had something
written down.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've already gone a half hour,
guys, with this show maybe a little longer
[SPEAKER_08]: than an hour, if nobody minds.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you guys- I'm going to take a
dab and I'm going to- I'm starting a fight
[SPEAKER_08]: right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell me a little bit about PGRs and how
you feel about them.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to jump in real quickly.
[SPEAKER_08]: PGR stands for Plant Growth Regulator,
you guys, and now I'm going to let Sean
[SPEAKER_08]: tell us about those while I take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's time and place for everything,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not in my food crops, at least not
synthetically made PGRs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's obviously plenty of ways to use
natural PGRs, plant hormones, gibberellic
[SPEAKER_00]: acid, triacan, and all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gibberellic acid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Gibberellic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to talk after the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a buttload of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do raw alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say barley sprouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, barley sprouts is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use barley tea every two weeks on my veg
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I always actually alternate alfalfa
and barley for veg and then corn and
[SPEAKER_00]: barley for flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't used corn yet, but that's just
because I haven't found- I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: I know- Fox News.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Organic?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been learning a lot of cool little
additives you don't find at girl stores,
[SPEAKER_02]: although I'm going to start having some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ferments, ferments, ferments, ferments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cold processed extractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you're going to get your
natural PGRs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fermented plant juices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you're going to collect growing
nodes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you teach us what a PGR actually is?
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of explain what it is and what it
does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say what axioms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you familiar with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Explain that to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, what a PGR is, is it controls
the plant's growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contains either real or synthetic forms
of plant hormones, and then it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: make the plant react in a certain way,
usually by triggering apical dominance or
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulating the plant's SAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different ways that these PGRs can
affect the plants, but for the most part,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're applying it to the plant at a
certain stage in its growth cycle to make
[SPEAKER_00]: it do what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just manipulating nature.
[SPEAKER_08]: The most popular one, I think,
that a lot of us have used in the past
[SPEAKER_08]: would be Snowstorm Ultra.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's basically, they've taken,
I think it's Sea Kelp and other plant
[SPEAKER_08]: proteins and concentrated them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't I want to feed that to my
plants?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just trying to see that we can get the
literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is, a lot of those, I can't
really tell you without looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: What exactly is in it, but if you're
telling me it's the kelp, me personally,
[SPEAKER_00]: my favorite flower hardener back when I
used to use bottled organics was,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendo Avalanche, Mendocino Avalanche,
which is basically two different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: kelp and molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually adapted that to my- Just
replace the ball of crap and use kelp and
[SPEAKER_00]: molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make the real deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Natural, healthy PGRs versus- Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That goes right back into the fermented
plant juices, extracts is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's basically the same idea as,
if a human wants to get ripped,
[SPEAKER_08]: you shouldn't go inject steroids and sit
on the couch.
[SPEAKER_08]: You should go to the gym, eat protein,
eat vegetables, get all the things you
[SPEAKER_08]: need and work out.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not giving our plants a workout.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're feeding them energy bars and protein
shakes and treating them like shit and
[SPEAKER_08]: expecting them to be fully healthy.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need balanced healthy plants,
not just- Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use these- Steroid-boosted plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use PGRs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Axiom is one of the best- I've used lots
of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not on my personal stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen the results of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, just the idea of it is, you're using
this synthetic to stimulate the plant's
[SPEAKER_00]: SAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it systematic automated response?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first word might be off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even sure it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's some sort of automated response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it's the plant's ability to
protect itself in its defense mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the reason the plant produces
resin, is to protect itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what Axiom does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stimulates that chain reaction inside
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going into defense mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost stresses the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exactly what it's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's chemically stressing the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jess can probably contend with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're messing with gibberellic acid
and stuff, I get a lot of fox tailing when
[SPEAKER_00]: I use it later into flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's usually with any PGR.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gibberellic acid at one point was a choice
for people creating pimini seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, back before they- It makes them too
stretchy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've found silver thiosulfate that I make
myself is the best way for reversing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was meeting with some old heads this
morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were talking about colloidal silver
and cloning.
[SPEAKER_08]: Man.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're going to reverse seeds,
definitely make your own silver
[SPEAKER_08]: thiosulfate at home.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really easy to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make everything at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to apologize also.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you live in an apartment, if you're a
new grower, if you're not striving for
[SPEAKER_08]: what we are, don't feel bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: Use your bottles.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do what you can.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're a medical patient and you don't
have the physical ability to mix this shit
[SPEAKER_08]: up, we're not hating you.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just recommending.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're encouraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and reach out to us because we
definitely have ways that we could help
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live in an apartment, if you are
unable to mix your soil or make your own
[SPEAKER_00]: teas, there are definitely options out
there for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: See that stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Community on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody deserves that.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get Jesse's awesome ass truck and
we'll drive up your mountain and we'll
[SPEAKER_08]: come mix up soil in your yard for you and
we'll put it in pots and we'll carry it in
[SPEAKER_08]: and hopefully you can get your wheelchair
between the plants to water them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but I think people kind of
overcomplicate things with organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, if you want to grow organics or
start growing organics, I'd recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: going and finding a nice and organic
bottled line of nutrients, roots organic,
[SPEAKER_00]: general organic, age old organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the list goes on and on and
they're bio-biz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty simple stuff too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish hydrosolate is very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to use it when I was back in the
dizzy, but anyways, I'd recommend picking
[SPEAKER_00]: up a nice bottled organic nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then outside of that, go and get you some
nice Rocky Mount worm casting style worm
[SPEAKER_00]: castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quality is extremely important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot stress that enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find high quality worm castings or find a
high quality microbial source and then
[SPEAKER_00]: molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's your compost tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sean is pretty much describing the way I
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were supposed to call him something
different the whole time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's basically the way I grow inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can promise you, you get stellar results
and it's way better than hydro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for damn sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just replacing, you know,
synthetics have chelates and that's kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of the idea of using the tea with your
organic bottled nutrient is when you feed
[SPEAKER_00]: with the nutrient, you're putting it in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're feeding with your tea,
you're activating that soil to help it eat
[SPEAKER_00]: those nutrients to give it back into your
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good way to put that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great way to... If you're growing
with bottled organic nutrients and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not using a tea of some sort of microbial
source, you're just hurting yourself,
[SPEAKER_00]: plain and simple.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a couple of questions written down
for you and stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Will you give us a quick run through five
gallon bucket on how to make a nice...
[SPEAKER_08]: Jesse's done this for us, but will you
tell us how to make a nice microbial tea
[SPEAKER_08]: for just to start off with that we can use
almost any time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, without a doubt, worm castings
and molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't get any thing else,
just those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's your microbial source and
there's a food for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on your quality of castings,
a fourth a cup per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Molasses, depending on how often you're
using it, one teaspoon to one tablespoon
[SPEAKER_00]: per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside of that, kelp meal is always a
good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelp meal, I mean, if you're not familiar
with the benefits of kelp, you should
[SPEAKER_00]: really look it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plenty of plant hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a decent MPK value in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then really go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just molasses, earthworm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can go into kelp.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go into alfalfa, depending on veg,
flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you're going to kind of deliver
more of an MPK value to your plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you agree with the Rev's book,
True Living Organics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the Rev.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read his book, the Rev.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up learning organics just like
everybody else did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really don't agree with his stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, but I learned everything that I
know now from his book.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I wouldn't have went through that
trial, I wouldn't be where I am today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't be mad at him.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to learn what works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people who have used his stuff with
great success.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's not saying to skip it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, definitely not.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen some people crush it and have
amazing buds with super soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've seen other people have burnt up
shitty buds with super soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's how you grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done both.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are really funny about organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even with my Rocky Mountain Natural
Farming page, we kind of had to take a
[SPEAKER_00]: break with posts for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to put informative posts up trying
to help the community, but we're met with
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of defiance.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, as soon as you put up, I quit posting
a lot of stuff on Facebook, because as
[SPEAKER_08]: soon as you put up a helpful thing,
10 people tell you why you're stupid for
[SPEAKER_08]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to each his own, you don't have to
agree with the way I grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if I say something wrong,
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a lot easier for you to focus
on one point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of stuff I got to remember.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've actually made mistakes on this
podcast and I felt proud to come back and
[SPEAKER_08]: say, Hey guys, last week, I told you the
wrong way.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like Jesse called me.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, you just said this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like people are getting too caught
up in this growing style or that growing
[SPEAKER_00]: style, or he grows like this or they grow
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just people need to choose their
own information.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amateurish in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: All three of us grow different ways and
you don't see us fighting like children.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we all borrow something from each
other.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure you've learned something and
you've learned something from me and I've
[SPEAKER_08]: learned five things from you and five from
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all still doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love talking to synthetic growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never grown marijuana synthetically.
[SPEAKER_00]: My background is in commercial
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown millions and millions of GMO,
horrible, horrible synthetic plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not proud of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Food crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: Food crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All edible food.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can look on my Instagram and
see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thousands.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 30 acres of glass greenhouses we
were running.
[SPEAKER_00]: People got to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, there's a certain point in
time that you've got to kind of figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: what means more to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it your money or your morals?
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked away from making $45,000 a year,
which is, you know, it's a good bit for
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking student loans, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, you know, I walked away from that
and got a part-time job here in town
[SPEAKER_00]: working at a hydro store and just grew
because, you know, that's what I wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I couldn't, it's a lot easier to wake
up and look at yourself in the mirror
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I started a seed company
because I got tired.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's kind of what led to it,
but that's how I ended up self-employed.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to work for somebody all day
for something I don't support for a
[SPEAKER_08]: minimum wage and hate myself.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd rather be kind of struggling and
really happy and have a cool job.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've got everything I want.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a cool ass girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can do what I want.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a seed company and I'm not rich.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think if I were rich, I'd just be
depressed and confused on all this money.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I wouldn't know if you guys are my
friends because I'm rich or because you
[SPEAKER_08]: guys are cool as shit and we're brothers.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd be like, do these guys just want to
come smoke all my live resin?
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I've got an ounce of it in my
pocket.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I've got, we're, we are rich.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're rich this way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause we make, we make the, we know that
we're not poisoning people.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're growing a quality product.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're contributing.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're moving it forward.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're making the cannabis a good thing
instead of a scary thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I walked away from a $25 an hour job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they asked me to leave, but I walked
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually told me, uh, I had to quit
smoking weed and I said no.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a lot of people will tell you that
that's ridiculous, but you have to choose
[SPEAKER_08]: the decisions that make you happiness over
money is way important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't drink a fifth of whiskey every
night now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to sobriety.
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't had alcohol in a long time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not a drinker either.
[SPEAKER_08]: I still enjoy beer, but I don't know if
I'm really, really good at drinking or
[SPEAKER_08]: really, really bad at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure which one it is, but either
way, I'm not a big person.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can tell, like one beer wasted the
biggest lightweight.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I bet you two beers would crush me
now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd be silly sitting in the corner.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, let's see.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted, uh, you kind of told me earlier,
what is your average, uh, harvest weight?
[SPEAKER_08]: Per thousand watt light running your
organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, it varies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last round we ran with the kind of like
the style Jesse was talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, with the, just a bottled nutrient kind
of, or a bottled organic supplemented with
[SPEAKER_00]: teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were hitting around, I say 1.7 pounds
per light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this last grow, um, which is what I
brought you today was grown with no
[SPEAKER_00]: bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely none.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this was all, uh, fruit juices,
plant juices, the calcium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a pretty mild soil to compared
to like TLO.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really, uh, go light on my soil mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think over mending is a big problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's really impressed me about
that jar you got there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know your, your soil mix is almost
minimal.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm holding the boat up to the
microphone, but it's not loud enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we hit, uh, I hit probably a 1.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not done pulling yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll text you with a final weight and you
can throw it up on a later show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, right now I'm kind of looking at
1.2, but that's with no bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and these are new strains that I'm
running this round.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a favorite strain to grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I'm still so, I still feel
so like new to the growing game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, growing back East and kind
of growing what you have to, you get out
[SPEAKER_00]: here and, you know, so I guess flow would
probably be my favorite strain.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a great, she loves to take good
pictures too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, outside of the flow, Citrex,
I think we were talking about that
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one is definitely going to be in the
garden for a long, long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, outside of that I've grown,
I've had a pleasure growing on some of
[SPEAKER_00]: your gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown the grateful dog, the heart of
gold, lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the heart of gold was my personal
favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it was racy to say the least.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's, it's not like you wake up in
the middle of the night and you
[SPEAKER_00]: accidentally grab that to put you back to
sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You fucked up.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the golden goat in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: The golden goat is definitely Sativa
heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I wish I had taken it like a week
longer than I, how long did you let it go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think I cut it at like nine.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, I think about 10 weeks is usually
what I recommend for the heart of gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took once at 76, 77 days once.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think probably 72 as far as I go.
[SPEAKER_08]: So DJ short's been preaching this 11,
13 light cycle.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I tried it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sean had a reaction right away.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad I decided to go that route.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a couple of things written down a
couple of ways to go.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm glad I went that way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I'll tell you my experience,
but what did you think about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Confusion, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, a little bit of information is a
dangerous thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I have to say about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, I see, I was saying, I see more
expression.
[SPEAKER_08]: The plants showed more color.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, a Sativa strain that has never really
Fox tailed on me kind of made fingery
[SPEAKER_08]: buds.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I got a lot of color.
[SPEAKER_08]: I keep saying that the color was
tremendous on this run, but I feel like it
[SPEAKER_08]: lowered my harvest weight by somewhere
between 10 and 20%.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not, I haven't cut everything down
yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got more to go, but I can tell it
diminished my harvest.
[SPEAKER_08]: That may have been from the cold,
but I really think it was from that light
[SPEAKER_08]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_08]: I felt the same thing about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: We always preach it.
[SPEAKER_08]: The most important nutrient to our plants
is the light.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we took a full hour and that's,
we took 60, three hours, 65 hours away
[SPEAKER_08]: from our plants, honestly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And one thing I did notice, they finished
quickly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, I probably saved two weeks on some of
my 10 or 11 week strains.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to finish week nine and
they'll be done.
[SPEAKER_08]: I, I'm worried to let them go too long.
[SPEAKER_08]: One may herm out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can see it kind of getting, it's pissy.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, you got to cut me down.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll cut her, but I just wasn't ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, it's a neat tool and a breeding
aspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, if we were tested across,
we had made, if you're looking for fino,
[SPEAKER_08]: if you're fino hunting, that is a good
point, but that's probably the only time
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll use it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hear that you've got growers and
advanced breeders and people talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just please don't try this at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need for you to herm everything
in your room and you're going to eat us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Stick with 1212, you guys stick with 1212.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to get adventurous,
if you're, uh, if you're kind of advanced,
[SPEAKER_08]: do what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't, I don't, I don't want to hold
anybody back, but be responsible.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause if you do go and herm out that crop,
you got to do something with that hermed
[SPEAKER_08]: out crop and don't go try to, he did not
just make a seed company.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not called calypso seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you hermed your crop, you didn't just
not make a seed company.
[SPEAKER_08]: You made a mistake.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to get those seeds out of there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Grow them, grow them yourself.
[SPEAKER_08]: Give them to your friend.
[SPEAKER_08]: Give free.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are free seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: That shit is free.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are the seeds you give to your
friends.
[SPEAKER_08]: You warn them these are from herm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you'll understand hopefully what
we're, you know, all the breeders are
[SPEAKER_02]: bitching about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sean, I'm just picking on you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's another guy named Sean figure
lover.
[SPEAKER_08]: His name is Sean also.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that's what his name is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I should even say that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: He posted a picture of himself today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what he looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been apparently it was like seven
years or 15 years, the GMOs or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: He puts the guy's a nut.
[SPEAKER_02]: His cats go.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you have somebody standing
next to you and you scroll through your
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram feed and then you hit Vigro's
page of a cat taking a shit in the toilet.
[SPEAKER_08]: So our buddy Vigor lover trained two
kitties, adorable kitties.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're a cat guy, he trained these
kitties to full on take a shit in the
[SPEAKER_08]: toilet like a human and they do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the only thing is he posts a video of
it every day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I've seen more cat butthole on his
feed than I have plants lately.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to Vigor lover, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, start tagging that iRegenetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, cats pooping hashtag iRegenetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Guys, we got about 10 minutes to go.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to start.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to have Sean back because we
got more stuff to talk about.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to start another long rant
because we get them going.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you guys have any plugs or shout outs
or anything you want to do?
[SPEAKER_08]: People you want to say thanks to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just Rocky Mount Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't give enough thanks to Jay and his
father.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they have an Instagram or anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: They do Rocky Mount Worm Company on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've also got a website,
rockymountwormcompany.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ship all over the country too.
[SPEAKER_00]: High quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I happen to know a high quality nutrient
company that smuggles the stuff into
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be thankful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live in Colorado, go and get the
damn castings because there's people out
[SPEAKER_00]: there who just want them so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just can't afford the shipping or they
don't have access to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just such an underutilized thing here
in town.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it doesn't sound like you need a whole
bunch.
[SPEAKER_08]: You said like a quarter cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, most people are putting in a cup
per gallon, these outrageous rates and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can use a fourth of cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you have five to 10% cutting into
your soil mix is just more than enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use like 80 pounds of it on my six
outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys will notice a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_08]: Grow a clone, grow two clones,
keep them in cups for like three weeks,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, until they're starting to get
root-bound, where they're pissed off
[SPEAKER_08]: root-bound.
[SPEAKER_08]: Feed one consistently with your microbial
tea with the worm castings in it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't add that to your other one when you
feed it and pull them out of the cup and
[SPEAKER_08]: watch.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll have thicker, fingery, dank,
happy roots on one.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the other one, you'll have these thin
angel hair pasta, wispy, shitty,
[SPEAKER_08]: sad roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you mulch the one that you're giving
the microbial tea, Jesus tripped on that
[SPEAKER_02]: word.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you put some mulch on there,
you'll see some really cool shit happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So try it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or just a plastic cover.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some fungus among us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, where do we find you on Instagram,
bro?
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: King Cola.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: King underscore Cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow them on there, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: King underscore Cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check me out at Rocky Mount Natural
Farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can link through that on my Instagram
or Jay's Instagram, Rocky Mount Worm
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a store opening soon?
[SPEAKER_08]: Did I hear something about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have a shop up in Colorado
Springs, 411A Tijuana Street in Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can come and check us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: See the worm operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it out for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got any questions, just come and
ask.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jesse, got any plugs?
[SPEAKER_08]: Any shout outs?
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse Gros, Instagram.
[SPEAKER_08]: Better say hi to your wife, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey baby.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bird, I hope you're listening to the
agriculture podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you're playing it in the store.
[SPEAKER_08]: Play the show in the store.
[SPEAKER_08]: That'd be really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep telling her too.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's like, I've already heard it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I did that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_08]: I could edit that out if you'd like.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: When is the next growers meeting?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we might be skipping December.
[SPEAKER_02]: Christmas and New Year's and all that good
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lack of a heater.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it is cold back there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're getting one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll take December off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure I make it to this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, me and Sean have talked about some
cool demos that he might come and help us
[SPEAKER_02]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell Jesse you want to learn some natural
farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, hit me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get this going.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to stock more of this stuff in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get rid of one of those things we talked
about earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a whole bunch of shelf space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help him help you make your own things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some synthetic grower in California or
wherever you are, hit me up dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll send you all that advanced.
[SPEAKER_02]: Help us get some organic stuff on the
shelf that you don't care about.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll give you a discount on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finish out your grow and then I'll help
you go organics next round.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can they get commercial pricing?
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll get way better than commercial
pricing if they buy it all.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I got to give one more shout out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I skipped one earlier.
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to give a big shout out to Robert
and Vegas and Craig from The Spot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also Angela, what's up from The Spot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also just Angela in general, but those
kids from The Spot, all those guys from
[SPEAKER_08]: The Spot and The Spot, Dispensary and
Pueblo West.

so I can't say any names yet though.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

put in is starting to pay off for all of

[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Number 44.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh man, it's a super special episode.
[SPEAKER_08]: On the mic over there to my left is a
super high.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my super high buddy, Adam.
[SPEAKER_08]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm good, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: We brought Adam on the show because for
some reason, we're not going to get too
[SPEAKER_08]: far into why, but for some reason we call
Adam 44 in our group.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a special number.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a special number.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sitting across the table from me is our
good buddy, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_08]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Man, thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh dude, I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if you're talking to me or
the podcast world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll answer for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think anyone's ever asked you
how's it going on your show.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm fucking high.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm drinking Yerba Mate and I got two of
my best friends at the table.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's nothing to complain about.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm super happy right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of Mate, I'm going to reach over
and take a sip.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you guys say something
entertaining?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm right there with you, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a good deal.
[SPEAKER_08]: That wasn't very entertaining.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a good week to say the least.
[SPEAKER_08]: You give the mic to Adam.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just stumble over shit and sit here and
talk to myself.
[SPEAKER_08]: Words were coming out.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's better than silence.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dead air is what you don't want,
but it eats.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to take it, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Adam's going to stop talking now and I'm
going to do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to turn Adam's mic up and turn
down the music a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to tease a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Coming up in this episode, we're going to
read a little bit about some Seth Rogen
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Seth Rogen came to Denver recently.
[SPEAKER_08]: His idea backfired.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll talk a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got an article from President Obama.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not from him.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about him.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there might've been another news
article.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember what I wrote down.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's right here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, the natives.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll talk about some stuff that may
happen on Indian reservations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been waiting for that announcement.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up next to a reservation.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have a special announcement coming
up also.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some official shit here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's quickly do some advertising,
guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that the advertising gets old.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't like you to do this, but there's
that 30 second forward on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just hit that if you get tired of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes there's coupon codes in there

[SPEAKER_02]: That unicorn shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: That unicorn shit.

[SPEAKER_08]: I just made that up.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a super huge shout out to Bern and
Jesse.
[SPEAKER_08]: This podcast is brought to you by our
great friends at Hygro Indoor Growing
[SPEAKER_08]: Supplies.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies has two
locations to serve Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: Visit the Denver store on 6271 Beach
Street or check out the Pueblo location at
[SPEAKER_08]: 618 East 4th Street in Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: Check out Hygro for competitive pricing
and a great selection of indoor grow
[SPEAKER_08]: supplies.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hygro is running a special for the podcast
listeners.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you're checking out, tell them that
you listen to the Hygro Culture podcast
[SPEAKER_08]: and you will get commercial pricing on
your entire purchase.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else cool to offer, Jesse?
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I'm stoned.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's exactly what I expected.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got Nanos in stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got the RTU systems for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cloud-based controlling.
[SPEAKER_02]: No more power boxes needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Timers were all built in.
[SPEAKER_02]: All kinds of nice shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They turn themselves up and down.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want it, he'll order it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If he doesn't have it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can grow while you're on vacation,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, to a point.
[SPEAKER_02]: To a point.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get a hydro grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does some data logging too for your
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you don't have to pay attention all
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can come back and check the data.
[SPEAKER_08]: You should pay attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really a big computer guy,
but I think cloud-based means you can
[SPEAKER_02]: check it from your phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at Adam.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like with security cameras and
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can basically just have another camera
on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't even need all that data to you
as long as you can see another camera that
[SPEAKER_08]: had all that data on the wall.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's multiple ways to do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go down there and check it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to go see what you got to offer.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hygro indoor growing supplies,
guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just over the bridge in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a little bit of parking in the
back.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard that there's nowhere to park.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are spots in the back, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got the door all fixed up too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, well, probably by the time this airs,
it'll be all fixed up and you can just
[SPEAKER_02]: walk in the back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at it done.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Park in the back.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you drive through the little taco thing
or through the alley and just turn right,
[SPEAKER_08]: you're right there in the back of Hygro.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's that door.
[SPEAKER_08]: The door that you wonder, is that the one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Hygro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to a handful of people that hit
us up for Rocky Mountain Earthworm
[SPEAKER_02]: Castings.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be on stock soon.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we say who the order from Arizona came
from?
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you remember who that is?
[SPEAKER_08]: No.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nevada, actually.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nevada.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I do not recall.
[SPEAKER_08]: That may have been a totally different
email then.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to have to check that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to the people that emailed me
and thanked me.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know who you are.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're coming to the store.
[SPEAKER_08]: They definitely said they're coming to the
store.
[SPEAKER_08]: So shout out to those guys that messaged
me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I got your state wrong if I did.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm in Colorado and those two states,
Arizona and Nevada, are the big desert
[SPEAKER_08]: down there.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we think of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, we're all square states.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do hope you guys have time to message me
when you're coming to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll visit.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll link up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe take some dabs if you're into that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So big love and much respect to all the
sponsors for making the show possible.
[SPEAKER_08]: Big shout out to the Mystic Roots band,
Coot Dogg and Kat and the rest of the
[SPEAKER_08]: Mystic Roots band.
[SPEAKER_08]: They let me play all of their music.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've given me full permission for their
whole catalog on the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: That helps a guy out trying to run a show
and keep things fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty damn cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been playing a song called The Doggy
Dub for the intro for the past couple
[SPEAKER_08]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's instrumental.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got a nice flow to it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of got my vibe.
[SPEAKER_08]: So thanks for letting me use that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a Stitcher comment.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like to read the Stitcher and iTunes
comment.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have an iTunes comment from our good
friend, Fred Garvin.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up, Fred?
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for listening, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: He said, great show, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Fred.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks to everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Me and Jesse were talking about that the
other day, that Stitcher really needs to
[SPEAKER_08]: get on that comment section thing where it
needs to be linked right to you or maybe
[SPEAKER_08]: somewhere where somebody else can see it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like just a looker, not maybe a user that
has to log in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stitcher is hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't comment from a mobile device on
Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't find any way to do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Stitcher, get on that, you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's how I listen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Every single podcast is through Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's what I use.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you guys on Stitcher want to leave a
comment, I apologize that you can't,
[SPEAKER_08]: but you can go to the iGrowCulture
Facebook page and log in and leave a
[SPEAKER_08]: comment, or you can just simply email me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love to read your email.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate that just as much.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want me to read it on the show,
I certainly will.
[SPEAKER_08]: The YouTube is another place where you can
go and comment.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe not all the episodes are up,
but you know... They will be.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm catching up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been keeping myself extra busy.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can still put something down like
episode 35 was da, da, da, da,
[SPEAKER_08]: da, da, da.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's there for everybody to read.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't have to have a YouTube account
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the reasons that you put it
up on that market.
[SPEAKER_02]: The iReeGenetics site too, you can comment
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like it if you guys, if you're a
listener that listens a lot and you want
[SPEAKER_08]: to interact, if you go to the iReeGenetics
Colorado website, join the forum,
[SPEAKER_08]: make yourself a profile on there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go to one of my posts or go start a new
post.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ask me a question.
[SPEAKER_08]: I will interact with you for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Usually on Monday or Tuesday nights when I
get all my work done, I want to sit back,
[SPEAKER_08]: take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_08]: I dab out and go on the forum and just
post pictures.
[SPEAKER_08]: I post a lot of pictures in my blog.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of pictures.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of stuff on there that
doesn't make it to Instagram.
[SPEAKER_08]: And one thing that's cool is they can't
filter me.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my website.
[SPEAKER_08]: I own that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tony and I built that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tony built it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I drew it in crayon pretty much on a
paper.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, this is what I want the
homepage to look like.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I drew tabs at the top.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I was like, this is what I want
the second page to look like.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he kind of did my vision.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a work in progress, you know,
but for what I drew, he nailed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I joined it when you first launched it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's about all I've done as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just joined it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, just go click like on some shit and
put some traffic on there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I was the one that found out that I
had a karma deal or something on the
[SPEAKER_08]: issue.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we got that worked out as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: I also want to give a huge thanks to
everyone who sent me messages.
[SPEAKER_08]: And comments from episode 43.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got more response off episode 30.
[SPEAKER_08]: 35 and 43 have been our most popular
episodes.
[SPEAKER_08]: 35 was drying and curing with Jesse and I,
and 43 was organics with King Cola.
[SPEAKER_08]: So awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: King Cola will definitely, definitely be
back.
[SPEAKER_08]: Big, huge thanks to King Cola.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sean, if you're listening, thanks a lot,
dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got a couple of questions for you
from a listener, actually.
[SPEAKER_08]: He wants me to relay a couple of
questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we got to get you back on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I got a few too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had a ton of response from it as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a huge episode and I hope that
worked out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Rocky Mountain Worm Company is going to
definitely see some results for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to those guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to go down there and get myself
a, I've got some plants that are going to
[SPEAKER_08]: transplant into larger pots here within
the next five days.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they will definitely be getting fed
Rocky Mountain Worm Tea.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's an opportunity there as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys tell them that you're listening
to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell them that people are here in Colorado
or supporting them and not as- They've
[SPEAKER_08]: actually commented on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I was saying.
[SPEAKER_08]: We may have a Wormy sponsor here in the
future.
[SPEAKER_08]: I never heard of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm with these guys most of the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was kind of one of their little held
secrets, but then they blasted it on the
[SPEAKER_08]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not held secret, but it's just,
you got to know Sean's secrets.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all Sean brought that to the table.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, I want to give a huge shout out to
everybody from the Garden of Whedon.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mentioned that the Garden of Whedon may
be on here to talk about their Secret Cup
[SPEAKER_08]: experience.
[SPEAKER_08]: They just got back from Vegas.
[SPEAKER_08]: They had a great time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, they did not take home the
trophy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some coastal guys won.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some guys from the coast, which,
you know, you can handle that.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not bitter about it, although they
were busy.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Garden of Whedon was a little bit
busy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was over there hanging out today and I
was like, you want to come on the show?
[SPEAKER_08]: And they kind of showed me what they had
to take care of and kind of hinted at me
[SPEAKER_08]: that today was not the day to come on a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in the future we'll have Spence.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully we can get Maddie over.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maddie's never been on the show,
I don't think.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, she hasn't.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got to get Maddie over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would that be the first female on the
show?
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be the first female on the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it'd be an honor to have it either
Maddie or Angela.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've invited Angela and she doesn't
seem excited to talk on the show,
[SPEAKER_08]: which is understandable.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're not a podcast person,
that's cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: But busy is the word of the week.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody's been slanted busy the couple
of weeks just to get everybody to pull out
[SPEAKER_08]: of their lives for an hour to come do the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not only that, but let's look at,
you know, like he'd been sick just there
[SPEAKER_08]: before.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he's been, he's good, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's good.
[SPEAKER_08]: He looks good now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Spence was down to like 140 pounds.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's six foot four.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was 140 pounds.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's almost back to a normal weight.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just glad to hear that he made it
home.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all you can eat buffets out in Vegas.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was talking about some of the banging
food.
[SPEAKER_08]: They said they had a French toast at some
place.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, let's get in a car,
bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's just go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll make some bomb French toast.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go over to Jesse's later.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to send a huge shout out to Joey.
[SPEAKER_08]: Joey got a hoodie from me today and I
hadn't seen Joey in a long time.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was kind of nice to hook up with
Joey, get him a hoodie.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to look sharp in that hoodie.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm wrapping up shout outs.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I got a lot of them here at the
start of the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's easier to get them out of the way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Much respect and much thanks and much love
to Mike, Adam and Angela.
[SPEAKER_08]: They trimmed their little fingers off.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Angela's little fingers might not
have normal size.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's beastly at it though.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how the little chick trims
faster than anybody else I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Angela is, I will say it on the air.
[SPEAKER_08]: Angela is the fastest trimmer I've ever
fucking known.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's one guy I know that might keep up,
but he takes at her all.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I know a guy that might keep up.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't compete if you're enhancing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, she's taking, she's dabbing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Giving people shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, huge shout outs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Angela is involved in the shout out again,
but huge shout out to Angela, Vegas,
[SPEAKER_08]: Craig, everybody over at The Spot.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to give you a huge shout out to The
Spot Dispensary in Pueblo West,
[SPEAKER_08]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've treated me super kind.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been in a couple of talks,
a couple of meetings and things have
[SPEAKER_08]: happened.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I'm ready to make the official
announcement.
[SPEAKER_08]: Today in the mail, I received my Colorado
med badge.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am now officially legally licensed to
work in a Colorado medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_08]: facility, which means that at this time I
can take the job that I've been offered.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am now the official master grower at The
Spot in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: So within the next few months,
there's a little bit of work to be done on
[SPEAKER_08]: the grow site to get it up to what I want
and what we are expecting.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are over 200 lights in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be the master grower for those 200
lights, which means that in probably,
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to say six months, I'm going to
give myself six months, you guys will see
[SPEAKER_08]: fire coming out of there produced by Rasta
Jeff out of The Spot in Pueblo,
[SPEAKER_08]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm excited to announce that one.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm proud to be a part of that team.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was a little picky about where I wanted
to go, what I wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: A couple of people have offered me things.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like their grow and I get along with the
people there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it'll be a great thing to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: My girlfriend is the bud tender.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am the master grower.
[SPEAKER_08]: My girlfriend is the trimmer also.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it'll have my love in it all the way
from the seed or the clone all the way up
[SPEAKER_08]: to the time it reaches the customer and or
patient's container.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's going to have Rasta Jeff love from
beginning to end now.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, I'm proud to work with The Spot.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my big announcement that I've been
kind of teasing about on social media and
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to compliment the Colorado MED in
Springs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody made it sound like it was a big
deal to go get your med badge and it was a
[SPEAKER_08]: pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did have a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a tax issue from my past that I had
to clear up and I had to get a noted paper
[SPEAKER_08]: that my child support was current and
cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I already did that because I knew that
was coming and they never asked for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But they said that they would.
[SPEAKER_08]: They never asked for those papers.
[SPEAKER_08]: I went in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in Colorado Springs, you're able to
call and make an appointment.
[SPEAKER_08]: The hardest part is getting the
appointment.
[SPEAKER_08]: Call every day until you get an
appointment because I had to call three
[SPEAKER_08]: times in a row.
[SPEAKER_08]: They called me back after the third one.
[SPEAKER_08]: I set an appointment.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got there early.
[SPEAKER_08]: She saw I was early.
[SPEAKER_08]: She took me right when I got there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_08]: She got me out of there within 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_08]: My full appointment was 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Giving her the paper.
[SPEAKER_08]: She reviewed the paper.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's one lady that's there all the
time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish I could remember her name.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was excited and anxious so I don't even
know what she looks like to tell you the
[SPEAKER_08]: truth.
[SPEAKER_08]: You go into that fucking concert mode.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to see this and get it done.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, med lady.
[SPEAKER_08]: She was awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: But they take your fingerprints on the
digital fingerprinter, which is kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they run all your background
checks and then they take a picture of you
[SPEAKER_08]: and she high fives you and tells you,
have a good day.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that happened Tuesday at 11 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_08]: Today when I got my mail, it is Thursday
as we record.
[SPEAKER_08]: My med badge came in the mail today.
[SPEAKER_08]: So my background check, my tax thing,
all my child support, my fingerprints,
[SPEAKER_08]: everything got done probably within five
or six hours.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hands down the fastest turnover rate I've
heard of.
[SPEAKER_08]: I went prepared.
[SPEAKER_08]: I went with everything I needed because I
called and asked.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, what am I going to need?
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a small business.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have child support.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's like, as long as your child support
is current and you can prove it and as
[SPEAKER_08]: long as your taxes are good on your small
business.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, I got that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Watch.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: They never asked for proof.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess they probably could tell just by.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they do some.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of their application was 13 pages.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think seven of those pages are you
signing, writing your name, signing and
[SPEAKER_08]: dating saying that this agency can go
through all of my shit and this agency can
[SPEAKER_08]: go through all of my shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if I missed anything, this other
agency can go through all the other shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like everything, but your medical
records get reviewed.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think your money, your criminal,
like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then she puts on a rubber glove.
[SPEAKER_08]: She puts on a rubber glove and says,
you want to come back here with me?
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're just fingerprinting you at
that point.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I was like, they're going that far.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why everybody talks about how bad
it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they're getting the wrong treatment
up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you were just nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot say I had that experience,
but no, but I got mine right before the
[SPEAKER_02]: first of the year last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I bet that there was a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, now in screens you can make
appointments and they're kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: sticklers.
[SPEAKER_08]: They will tell you if you miss your
appointment, it'll be a while before you
[SPEAKER_08]: can get back.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause you go to the bottom of the list and
you're like, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you got it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was, I'm prepared.
[SPEAKER_08]: I left an hour and a half early to get to
45 minute drive.
[SPEAKER_08]: My puppy ate my badge.
[SPEAKER_08]: So oops.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 10 bucks for replacement.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think you need an appointment for
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: They do not take cash.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys, if you ever go into the med,
go get a money order for the total.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's changed.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's anything pretty much here in
Colorado, except for like that office in
[SPEAKER_08]: Springs isn't in a shitty area,
but parts of Springs right near like
[SPEAKER_08]: Colorado Springs on one side of the street
is gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_08]: The other side of the street.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're like, I don't want to fucking park
my car here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're kind of in one of those like
off to the side areas.
[SPEAKER_08]: They could be, I wouldn't wreck.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not saying this.
[SPEAKER_08]: They could easily be a victim of robbery
or something.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not saying go do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm saying they could.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's wise that they don't keep a lot of
cash.
[SPEAKER_08]: And my badge alone was 300 bucks and they
probably do 20 appointments a day at 150
[SPEAKER_08]: or $300 per appointment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Price went up for that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 150 for the key or 150 for the
support and 300 for the key.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to get the key because I'm the guy
in the back.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the prices doubled.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you're upgrading badges,
it's still like 253 bucks to go from one
[SPEAKER_08]: to the other.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you should have just paid that in the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_08]: So guys, if you're curious, if you need to
get the big badge or the little one,
[SPEAKER_08]: if you can afford it, just get the big
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes you a more valuable asset too.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can actually ask for more pay if you
have that larger badge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be a good episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess we just did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of Colorado listeners.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll back up a couple steps.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you guys want to apply to be able to
work in the medical marijuana industry,
[SPEAKER_08]: the marijuana industry, you can take the
medical word out.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to be employed in any way in
the marijuana industry in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_08]: what you need to do is go to... There's a
website.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the... The Colorado Department of
Revenue.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there will be marijuana documents on
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Print out the application for it's a man
head employment application.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not the business application.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's only the one for an employment.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it'll say key or support, which is how
you know if you're doing the right ones.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want the... Just go for that key or
support.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you don't want to be like a manager or
something, if you just want to trim or bud
[SPEAKER_08]: tent, all you need is a support.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you want to get paid a little more,
and if you want to have some chance of
[SPEAKER_08]: climbing up that corporate ladder,
get that big one, get that support.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then they always have to have a support
badge on premises.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if boss needs to go somewhere,
maybe you can step up and show that you
[SPEAKER_08]: can do that shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how people advance.
[SPEAKER_08]: So go on the website, print out that
application, read it thoroughly before you
[SPEAKER_08]: even start printing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because there's one page that says,
if any of this stuff applies to you,
[SPEAKER_08]: go fuck yourself.
[SPEAKER_08]: It pretty much says, if you did this,
you cannot get a badge.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's straight up no.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just read your application now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Primarily, it's kind of the same stuff as
getting into the military.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no drug felonies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no drug felonies.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is their main one.
[SPEAKER_08]: I should have had the list here,
but I didn't realize we're going to have
[SPEAKER_08]: this conversation.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, all that's there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's basically common sense at that
point.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're in another state or
whatever... And just to clarify,
[SPEAKER_08]: this means to work behind a counter,
selling herb to people, selling cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: to people.
Legally.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, this doesn't mean you can't live in
Colorado and can't have three plants or
[SPEAKER_08]: six plants, whatever the state...
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not what this is about.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can still be a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can still grow your own.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is just to work in a regulated shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: To become part of the industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: And right now, I hate saying this,
but it's what I feel and part of why I'm
[SPEAKER_08]: making the business decisions I'm making.
[SPEAKER_08]: See, I think that in the future,
iRegenetics will be able to breed inside
[SPEAKER_08]: of this large facility that I've just
become master grower of.
[SPEAKER_08]: And right now, if I don't make a move like
that, the way that I'm growing and the way
[SPEAKER_08]: that my business model works, I think the
industry will squeeze me right out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I either need to join it or get squeezed
out of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is my way to join it and not
disappear.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to be here for the long haul.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've thought about this.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like I'm selling out a little bit,
but I'd rather give than not exist at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I got to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, all right, guys, if you get that
application, fill it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're not in Colorado, you got to come
to Colorado and you have to show
[SPEAKER_08]: initiative.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to go to a bunch of dispensaries
and apply in person.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to be kind of persistent,
almost being an asshole about it because
[SPEAKER_08]: so many people apply every day.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're a hot chick, you're going to get
in.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to know a little bit about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come with some knowledge and be willing to
start at a shitty job.
[SPEAKER_08]: Be willing to clean the toilets and trim
pot for eight hours a day because that's
[SPEAKER_08]: what we need mostly.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need trimmers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Trimmers get paid decently here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And be dependable, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is such a high turnover rate in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one thing that kind of looks bad
about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't brag about your trimming ability.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't tell me you can trim a pound and
show up and not be able to trim at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll fire you.
[SPEAKER_08]: While you're on your phone.
[SPEAKER_08]: While you're on your phone all day.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are so many people.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are so many people from around the
world that want in this industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you don't perform to top notch,
we'll fire you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't say we, I just got into this shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I moved here.
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll fire you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can tell you firsthand, if you don't,
there's plenty of people that hit the wall
[SPEAKER_08]: every day and then they get paid and
they're just like, I'm rich and I'm around
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just drop out like flies.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be a cool job, but it is still very
much a job.
[SPEAKER_08]: I visit dispensaries here in town.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when I go in there every week and
nobody's there, or it's different people
[SPEAKER_08]: in there every week.
[SPEAKER_08]: Different employees, no customers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Plenty of customers, especially
recreational and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's always lines.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been going to the spot for a couple
of reasons recently, mostly to talk to the
[SPEAKER_08]: owners out there and the bosses and to see
if we can negotiate.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also my favorite person, a second
favorite person, I have a daughter.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're second.
[SPEAKER_08]: The daughter comes first.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's just kind of picking on me.
[SPEAKER_08]: But she's out there and I go out there to
visit her and go take her lunch or just go
[SPEAKER_08]: see what's up.
[SPEAKER_08]: And dude, it's hard for her to get away
from the counter because they've got
[SPEAKER_08]: business to go with.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not going to go and sit down behind
a counter and be like socializing with
[SPEAKER_08]: people.
[SPEAKER_08]: You would think that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You still have to have customer service,
but you have 14 people out and they'll be
[SPEAKER_08]: waiting.
[SPEAKER_08]: I told the bosses there that I don't want
a budtend.
[SPEAKER_08]: I said, no, I'd rather not be a budtender.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just rather stick with being the grower
because there'll be downtime for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think once in a while, just for fun,
and I'll announce it on the podcast and be
[SPEAKER_08]: like, hey guys, and I'm not, I don't mean
this right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is just hypothetical and I'm not even
going to say it like a real sentence.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll say, on this day, I will be
budtending at the spot.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you guys want to come and buy some
Capelten from Ross to Jeff, you mentioned
[SPEAKER_08]: the agriculture podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll give you 10% off.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: That shit's going to be happening pretty
soon.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the kind of stuff that we have in
mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Budtending is kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like people.
[SPEAKER_08]: I really love people.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how I started.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how I got my foot in the medical
industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: I started helping somebody transplant that
had their own shop and too many plants and
[SPEAKER_08]: couldn't handle it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw him struggling.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, you need help?
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, you know how?
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, fuck you, I do.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, grab a bucket, do this.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was older than me, so I was able to
work circles around him.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, come back tomorrow and I'll pay
you.
[SPEAKER_08]: He gave me way more than I expected and
that was for the rest of the week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, all right, this works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of how I got my first job.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess that's the point.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go show that you can do some work.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't be a pussy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Show some initiative.
[SPEAKER_08]: Be grateful.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the weed industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're going to think, I can show up
with my long hair down.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't need to take a shower.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can put on my grateful dead shirt,
my fucked up jeans.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can if you work, but you still got
to treat it like a real job interview.
[SPEAKER_08]: We want you to be able to work.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm saying we because I've got my own
cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_08]: I own a seed company.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I can qualify.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd rather you kind of just show up and
maybe show some initiative.
[SPEAKER_08]: If somebody would come in and sit at the
table and not do anything the whole time
[SPEAKER_08]: and not show any initiative, then they
probably wouldn't be there on the next
[SPEAKER_08]: one.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why the tremors that were here,
there were three tremors here for like
[SPEAKER_08]: four nights in a row.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's kind of stressful for all three
of those people to take four nights out of
[SPEAKER_08]: their lives and come trim pot for me with
me helping them.
[SPEAKER_08]: I could have called two or three other
people, but I liked and trusted everybody
[SPEAKER_08]: here and I could have driven to the store
and came back and nothing would have gone
[SPEAKER_08]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I keep the people that I keep.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what it's about, trust.
[SPEAKER_08]: Be trustworthy.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're working in the weed industry,
we want some clean people.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're around stuff that people are
consuming and the MED is a stickler for
[SPEAKER_08]: dirtiness.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jesse just shook his head and rolled his
eyes because he knows the MED is kind of a
[SPEAKER_08]: bitch.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love you guys for giving me my badge,
but you guys have some crazy fucked up
[SPEAKER_08]: rules.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shots fired.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been talking a lot about a lot of
good news.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do have some semi-sad news.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you guys are ready for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm ready for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Give it to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: There is rumor that the podcast will
receive a cease and desist letter.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can continue to podcast, but not under
the name iGrow Culture.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody has sent me anything yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of businesses and podcasts and
YouTube and Facebook and Instagram things
[SPEAKER_08]: have been being forewarned that a business
called iGrow, which is a college
[SPEAKER_08]: institution that does college
horticultural stuff, is coming after
[SPEAKER_08]: people using the iGrow moniker.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no problem changing the name.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to do it slowly if it does
happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to do it preemptively before I
actually get a cease and desist letter in
[SPEAKER_08]: the mail or email to me or however it's
going to happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it just be responsible and kind.
[SPEAKER_08]: If that's their name and they've got it,
I don't really feel like I want to rip
[SPEAKER_08]: them off.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just thought it was cute.
[SPEAKER_08]: My buddy Kevin and I came up with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to use the I because it's the
modern iGrow, iPhone, iPod.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the I world and it's iGrow.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're listening.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're learning to grow from me on your
iPhone.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a play on the word agriculture is
what we thought all along.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the iGrow culture, but we're going to
have to change it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I already know what the name will become.
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't decided for sure that I want to
do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I may just do it on December 1st.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go iGrow culture slash this podcast
for a month or two for when people get
[SPEAKER_08]: used to it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We may have to change the name,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll still be the same show.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing's going to change but the logo and
the title.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Bender, if you're listening,
bro, the new title of the show will be the
[SPEAKER_08]: Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can just relate that to them,
but all right.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, with the listeners, if you guys
are listening now and this shit
[SPEAKER_08]: disappears, look for the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be the same feed.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, nothing will change.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can type in the title on the feed and
change the feed in my website stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything will be legit.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll all stay the same other than the
words.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Bender, help me out, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll make it up to you somehow.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you got a paypal, bro, we'll hook you
up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Grow From Your Heart podcast or The Grow
From Your Heart podcast, whoever you want
[SPEAKER_08]: to do it, like a heart with maybe some
herb coming out of it or whatever,
[SPEAKER_08]: dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, red, gold, and green.
[SPEAKER_08]: He nailed it last time, so.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nailed that last one.
[SPEAKER_08]: That last logo was dope.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even... A heart kind of looks like
a seed splitting open too.
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Jesse, Jesse just hit gold over there.
[SPEAKER_08]: A heart of a seed splitting open,
a little sprout coming out of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: The sprout with the two leaves being the
heart.
See?
[SPEAKER_08]: Jesse's on this shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whoever can do some art.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're in Colorado and you're an adult
and you can find me face to face,
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll pay you in seeds or herb.
[SPEAKER_08]: I will gift you seeds and herb in return
for making me this.
[SPEAKER_08]: I won't pay you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can gift you shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can totally give you a gift of kindness
to say, and you can also give me a gift of
[SPEAKER_08]: a sweet ass logo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kindness you don't even know.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're not 21 and you're not in
Colorado, I'll get you like an irie
[SPEAKER_08]: genetics t-shirt if I have your size in
stock.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll send you something fucking cool from
Colorado to make it up for you,
[SPEAKER_08]: up to you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I also need a logo.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not begging, but I need a logo.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how you get into the community,
man.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, need a theme song.
[SPEAKER_08]: When it's community made nine times out of
10, you'll probably get a flood of stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to be like, help me pick this.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you guys send theme songs, grow from
your heart podcast, that's going to,
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to have to, I'm just going to
start saying that pretty soon here.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be well, that way people
can, I don't want to get, I don't even
[SPEAKER_08]: want to start hearing it.
[SPEAKER_08]: That other company that owns the name.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was a phrase you told me one of
the first times we like sat down and like
[SPEAKER_02]: really talked about growing and breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Breed from your heart actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what she said.
[SPEAKER_08]: Breed with love and grow from your heart.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been preaching those things for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those have always been.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's the truth.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it makes your life and your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're not doing that, you're a dick.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're going to grow cannabis and
you're not starting and just like sitting
[SPEAKER_08]: in that room 24 seven, just like on your
hands and knees, cross-legged,
[SPEAKER_08]: like any style, like loving on them,
then that's, you're not getting this part
[SPEAKER_08]: of the story.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to write it down.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's official.
[SPEAKER_08]: Grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just got to get people out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Spread the word.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spread the word.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, most people are listening.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of you guys that are listening will,
you already know because you're listening.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, these are one of those times that we
were talking about where I say something
[SPEAKER_01]: dumb.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know that it's dumb.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not even going to critique what you
said.
[SPEAKER_08]: See?
See?
[SPEAKER_08]: You can go on.
[SPEAKER_08]: We really like to pick on Adam.
[SPEAKER_08]: Extreme enthusiasm.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nah, that's all good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Adam likes to get picked on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: One of my favorite things to do,
Adam likes to start a rant and then he'll
[SPEAKER_08]: stare at you as he does it waiting for you
to reply and when you don't reply,
[SPEAKER_08]: he just puts his foot deeper in his mouth.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like, and then you look at him like,
uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it would be the perfect time right
then to stop.
[SPEAKER_08]: But he has three more things that he
really wants to cram in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bury into the dirt to make you think like,
Jesus Christ, what is wrong with this
[SPEAKER_01]: asshole?
[SPEAKER_08]: My favorite is when we're in the car and
he just starts doing it and he doesn't
[SPEAKER_08]: know if I'm silent because he's being a
dipshit or if I'm just driving or what it
[SPEAKER_08]: is.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's like, and blah, blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just, no, no reply.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to see what's next.
[SPEAKER_08]: Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to see what's going to come
after that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can he top that shit?
[SPEAKER_08]: He always does.
Always.
[SPEAKER_08]: He always manages to top his own foot in
his mouth.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why we keep you around,
bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm good for a laugh every now and then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Working with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either with me or at me, one or the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either way, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Working with him this last week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had some good laughs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like for real, you put food on the plate.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like for the shout out this week,
you brother.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like straight up.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys building a new play hut?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Playing in the dirt all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Screwing off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can, it's the Denver Bud Company.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be wholesalers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their business plan is to be able to buy
their brand of cannabis in dispensaries
[SPEAKER_02]: all over the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, they'll be opening sometime soon
when we're done building it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they got a few other hurdles after
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Inspections.
[SPEAKER_08]: The hardest part in Colorado right now is
getting damn water.
[SPEAKER_08]: Getting water rights for your grow is a
big, big, big deal.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw a huge fricking grow today out
south of Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're all around us right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you go out highway 96 towards Wetmore,
there's a huge grow and it's just right up
[SPEAKER_08]: against the highway.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're chain link fence.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can almost like flicker your fingers
in it when you drive.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's right up against the highway.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know which one that is.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the one you guys saw down south.
[SPEAKER_02]: That place has a fricking air strip on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to say one of the neatest I have
seen is my boy, Hanky B, over at the
[SPEAKER_08]: greener side dispensary on the Stem Beach
exit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I still haven't seen those.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've got a bunch of LED lights going.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then it's not happening right now,
but last season towards the end of the
[SPEAKER_08]: season, they had LED lights and it made
that whole, what is it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like a 60 by a hundred foot greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_02]: 60 foot, or no, shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: 120 is the length.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember the width.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's bigger than your house.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was filled with LED lights.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so when the sun set right at sunset,
it looked like aliens were invading for
[SPEAKER_08]: about a mile.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just this big purple ball.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was so awesome.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a neat greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was one of the best.
[SPEAKER_08]: Was that Forever Flowering?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Forever Flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Northern Altitude or Hemisphere or
something like that is the model with all
[SPEAKER_02]: the bells and whistles.
[SPEAKER_08]: All of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That thing sings to you in the morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do have a couple of news articles.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're 35 minutes in of great, crazy
rambling guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you like these episodes where we
just come and hang out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: The past couple of episodes have been
really intense.
[SPEAKER_08]: My friend Hippy Nurse, I haven't talked to
you in quite a while.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you're still listening to the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you're well.
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't talked.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just been busy, I guess.
[SPEAKER_08]: She takes notes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I hope this episode, I hope you
could put down your pen and just enjoy and
[SPEAKER_08]: hang out with us and maybe smoke a bowl or
take a dab and enjoy the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys want to take a dab together?
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whoever, if you guys are listening- People
like it when we all sit around and puff
[SPEAKER_08]: and- Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_08]: What did you do?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I moved the email.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything went fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: The wire on the wires there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope that didn't happen in the
recording, you guys, because we all- I
[SPEAKER_02]: hope it didn't either, because that's
going to sound- Damn.
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounded like my brain exploded in my
head and electricity happened.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's basically, I think, what happened.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we'd all just got hit by lightning
through the headphones.
[SPEAKER_08]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a news article too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: First time ever reading a news article.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bear with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not reading it either, but I'll just
hit the points.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, the good old Congress,
which I believe acts as city council of
[SPEAKER_02]: Washington DC, is one of the congressmen
has thrown in a- Shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just trying to gather up some
information here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways- I've got it on my screen if you
want me to read it for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me take this one dab news article.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we actually- Did you find it on the
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: HuffPost is where I got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw it on the cannabis this morning too.
All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to take this quick dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got some live resin from the Garden of
Weedon.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is- Let me read you the proper name.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is some serious fucking bullshit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Gorilla Hay- Not the dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: The dab is not bullshit.
[SPEAKER_08]: The article we're going to read is
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: This dab is fucking for real.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dab is some serious fucking fire.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Gorilla Hayes.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Moonshine Hayes, Gorilla Glue- Number
four.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they were blasted together in the
Obidose.
[SPEAKER_08]: Obidose.
[SPEAKER_08]: Obidose.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to Emotec.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, Emotec sent me a brand new e-mail.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had it running basically for a week
straight without turning it off.
[SPEAKER_08]: I turn it off when I go to bed and shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: But honestly, I walk up- It's like my
coffee pot.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you wake up, I walk up and turn it
on.
[SPEAKER_08]: You spend a lot of time sitting right
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's on a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: A feature for the e-mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Coffee pot timer kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: That'd be dope, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually put my old e-mail on a timer
because I used to fall asleep with it on.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I put it on a timer to shut off about
three in the morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: This one's got a fucking USB port that I
charge my phone on and it charges my
[SPEAKER_08]: iPhone so fast.
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet it does, especially the higher
temperature you raise it up to.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably connected to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just pop it right into there.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, I'm going to take this nap.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to Garden of Weedon.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it smells great.
[SPEAKER_08]: What up, Spence?
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody tell me about- I've yet to meet
him, but I'm sure I will here in the next-
[SPEAKER_02]: Spence, check out Garden of Weedon.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just killed, or actually Matty did,
but they both did.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just killed some government meal of
mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, it was amazing looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had a bunch of this color too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quite possibly one of the best rounds I've
ever seen of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't got to grow that strain inside
as much as I would have liked to.
[SPEAKER_08]: The stuff they post is just outrageous at
times, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the cross on your government meal?
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a G13 crossed with Tom Hill's Deep
Chunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom Hill is- everything he makes is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got a little collaboration
happening.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jesse is actually going to breed,
and I'm going to put the seeds in
[SPEAKER_08]: iRegenetics packages, and we're going to
sell them as iRegenetics products because
[SPEAKER_08]: I need some help.
[SPEAKER_08]: Will that be- Grats on that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Will that be the government meal be
involved in that project?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that times OGMail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I literally don't have a name for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to try to make up some crazy
name for the smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can just say it's a really good mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been proven.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's made several crosses for some small
time breeders.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it the OGMail I think of?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the one we were talking about the
other night.
[SPEAKER_02]: So unfortunately, there's not going to be
anything fancy on the package in regards
[SPEAKER_02]: to- it's just mystery mail or something
like that, but the government meal is
[SPEAKER_02]: serious fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: The two crossed together, it's going to
be- the government meal is real Deep Chunk
[SPEAKER_02]: cleaning.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got to give your mail a name.
[SPEAKER_08]: Gage calls his mail Joseph.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we just got to name it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just needs a cool name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Henry.
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be Henry.
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be the Henry OGMail.
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be what it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the name of the meal that I grew
up next to.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was Henry the Meal.
[SPEAKER_08]: You hear him every morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: That shit might have just accidentally
happened.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_08]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to read this news article,
but first I want to remind myself,
[SPEAKER_08]: oh, that's fucking dangerous.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just hit 10,000 Instagram followers.
[SPEAKER_08]: 10,000 Instagram followers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: All 10,000 of you, or at least the 150 of
you that like my pictures.
[SPEAKER_08]: What the fuck is that all about,
dude?
[SPEAKER_08]: Can a guy get a goddamn like?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you got to think though.
[SPEAKER_08]: People just don't get on it all that
often.
[SPEAKER_08]: And actually Instagram is going through
and cleaning up spam accounts and taking
[SPEAKER_08]: off all kinds of shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got one for him.
[SPEAKER_08]: The one I've been pitching on the show for
the past- by the way, guys, that's
[SPEAKER_08]: overgrown your Gov, just because somebody,
I forgot somebody had taken that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the only one that I missed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, so you've been pitching your Twitter
and somebody else's Twitter who has got
[SPEAKER_08]: like 60 followers and hasn't posted in two
years.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I would think if you went there and
it has nothing to do with cannabis and
[SPEAKER_08]: then nothing to do with anything- Slowly
say, you properly say your Instagram and
[SPEAKER_08]: Twitter.
[SPEAKER_08]: Overgrown your Gov. Overgrown your Gov. Am
I even following you?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: You found me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, usually people find me.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's definitely happened, but- Can we say
your real name on the show?
[SPEAKER_08]: Your full name?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Adam Gaskins.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I call him Gaskins when I call him.
[SPEAKER_08]: I tell Siri, call Adam Gaskins.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I heard when I was a kid,
so I'm helping them.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what else is fun?
[SPEAKER_08]: Put your phone, your Siri on a British
accent with a chick and it's hot,
[SPEAKER_08]: dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, is it?
[SPEAKER_08]: You're like, call Adam Gaskins and she's
all ringing.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet you are, bitch.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're kind of weird with that eye stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like my eye devices.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Apple cult.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, let's read this article that
Jesse kind of started to read.
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, Obama opposes congressional
effort to stop DC pot legalization.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And on the picture, it looks like he's
clapping, but he's not.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got this like weird facial
expression.
[SPEAKER_08]: This article is from, it just says
Associated Press.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody gets any credit here.
[SPEAKER_08]: The AP.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_08]: So whoever wrote it, sorry, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody cared.
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, President Barack Obama plans to
sign a $1.1 trillion government spending
[SPEAKER_08]: bill if it reaches his desk, although he
opposed a provision blocking the District
[SPEAKER_08]: of Columbia from legalizing marijuana.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jesse's practically searching his phone.
[SPEAKER_08]: I may be reading a different article.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, same one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to get that asshole
congressman's name.
[SPEAKER_08]: White House spokesman Josh Earnest said
Thursday that despite reservations,
[SPEAKER_08]: Obama is set to sign legislation to fund
nearly the entire government through the
[SPEAKER_08]: end of the budget year, September 30th.
[SPEAKER_08]: District voters approved an initiative
November 4th to allow possession of up to
[SPEAKER_08]: two ounces of pot or up to three mature
plants for personal use.
[SPEAKER_08]: But here we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Language inserted by Republicans in the
spending bill would bar the city from
[SPEAKER_08]: moving forward with legalization.
[SPEAKER_08]: Earnest says the president believes
Congress shouldn't interfere with the will
[SPEAKER_08]: of city voters on marijuana and other
issues.
[SPEAKER_08]: Obama supports statehood for the district.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they wrote a new budget proposal by
they, it looks like the Republicans have
[SPEAKER_08]: submitted this, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: But in the wording, they also try to block
the legalization of cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_08]: District of Columbia.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just in the city, not in the state,
correct?
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's a district, but you know what
I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the whole state.
[SPEAKER_08]: From what I read, it's going to be the
whole state, Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was speaking as I read it, so I may
not...
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I could definitely see the whole D
.C.
[SPEAKER_08]: area around the White House and the
presidential land, you know what I'm
[SPEAKER_08]: saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole district, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So here's what sucks is Obama would... So
it'll be legal without... Obama's down
[SPEAKER_08]: with D.C.
[SPEAKER_08]: being legalized.
[SPEAKER_08]: He says he's cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: He didn't write out, his spokesperson
says... But they have to pass the budget.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have to pass that budget.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't find that cocksucker's name.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't he go out?
[SPEAKER_08]: He's the president, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why doesn't he just fucking erase that
line?
[SPEAKER_08]: Wipe that shit out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something to do with some kind of bullshit
fucking... Can I be the first one to say
[SPEAKER_02]: it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead and say it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I see that he decriminalizes it at least
before he gets out, you know, because he
[SPEAKER_08]: was so... I'll leave it alone.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll leave it alone.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the raids and stuff while he was
here, and he's still like, there's a war
[SPEAKER_08]: on drugs still, and this, that,
and the other.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one of those things that I feel like
if he's going to do anything that gives
[SPEAKER_08]: him a like on the way out, it'll be
something along that line.
[SPEAKER_08]: If he can just bring it down to a new
substance law, you know... I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just sucks me.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got to do something before he leaves.
He's going to pass.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's going to pass.
[SPEAKER_08]: And spokesperson says he believes Congress
shouldn't interfere with the will of city
[SPEAKER_08]: voters on marijuana and other issues,
and he supports statehood.
[SPEAKER_02]: What it does is it blocks any
congressional or city money being used to
[SPEAKER_02]: implement the program.
[SPEAKER_08]: So... It's like a shitty ultimatum.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like... We don't need your
money.
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll gladly give it to you by the
droves.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you not been paying attention?
[SPEAKER_08]: What happened to voting and then what the
voters vote for happening?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like what happened to that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like your parents telling you,
you go to a house party on Saturday when
[SPEAKER_02]: they damn well know you'll be in Texas.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's nothing I can do about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's in the president's hands now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you guys in DC get to smoke your
recreational legal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they won't have a store, but they can
still fight the good fight, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they're doing is it sounds like
they're encouraging the gray market.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly what I thought when I read
the article first.
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounds like a good place to be a
caregiver.
[SPEAKER_08]: In Colorado, that gray market is getting
squeezed out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know pot's super illegal or expensive.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's not super illegal?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's super fucking expensive at the
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it seems like from hanging out in the
shop as much as I have been lately,
[SPEAKER_08]: there are a lot of people that would
rather just go to the dispensary shop from
[SPEAKER_08]: the jars.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are like 12 strains on the shelf at
the shop.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't get choice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, in my opinion, it's too
expensive, but that's because I'm a
[SPEAKER_08]: spoiled bitch.
[SPEAKER_08]: I grow my own herb.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know what it costs.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been paying really low prices for
several years now and to go there and it's
[SPEAKER_08]: double, a little more than double what I'm
used to paying.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's legal and it's accessible.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have to wait for anybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to sit in a cushy comfy chair and
listen to decent reggae music.
[SPEAKER_08]: They play good reggae there too.
[SPEAKER_08]: That has nothing to do with me.
[SPEAKER_08]: You sit in these cozy little chairs and
chill out and it's a chill environment.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you don't want to wait for your dude to
show up, if you just want to grab an
[SPEAKER_08]: eighth on the way home from work,
because the deals are sketchy in a parking
[SPEAKER_08]: lot and shit, you don't want to be doing
that anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just go to that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I could see the black and gray markets
just being shit right out of you.
[SPEAKER_08]: They would be totally wiped out,
I feel, if it was accessible in every
[SPEAKER_08]: street corner, almost like a damn liquor
store where there's 13 of them in town
[SPEAKER_08]: spread out instead of 14 of them out there
in a mile area.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just hard.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys in states that are just about to
legalize or that are pushing it,
[SPEAKER_08]: you got to get on top of shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: The day it pops, you got to get your shop
open because you have to start making
[SPEAKER_08]: enough money to comply with the
regulations that are coming.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because now that Colorado has set the
standard, other places are just kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: adopting that.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're just saying, Colorado is doing
this.
[SPEAKER_08]: They kind of set it around that.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not making the same mistakes as
well.
[SPEAKER_08]: They already have a template.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not getting what we used to call
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here was the wild, wild west that I talk
about.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jesse knows the wild, wild west real well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Grow the quarter pounds in the houses,
rent other houses, grow weed in there,
[SPEAKER_08]: take that weed to shops and sell it to the
shops straight up for cash.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd walk in with a backpack full of
pounds.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I had a variety, if I had five or six
quarter pounds, I could sell all of those
[SPEAKER_08]: quarter pounds for like 700, 750 a quarter
pound.
[SPEAKER_08]: You didn't walk out with cash back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a handful of shops here in town
and in the area that really, I guess,
[SPEAKER_02]: only one of them survived, well,
two.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't have grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got stuff from guys like me and Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was totally legal at the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was all medical.
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't that what people just went out and
got their med cards and that's what they
[SPEAKER_08]: did.
[SPEAKER_08]: That kind of squeezed the gray market
here, did it not?
[SPEAKER_08]: In town, just because it was accessible.
[SPEAKER_08]: Inside city limits?
[SPEAKER_08]: When we made our dispensary public,
we had a dispensary that we kept slightly
[SPEAKER_08]: private.
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't let a lot of people know about
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was in a little kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Private clubs are nothing new.
[SPEAKER_08]: But eventually we decided, let's take this
to the big room in our retail store and
[SPEAKER_08]: just kind of show that this is what we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: We drop prices in this town dramatically.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was 400 bucks an ounce for any kind of
kind bud for a while around here.
[SPEAKER_08]: About 10 years ago, 10 or 12 years ago,
400 bucks an ounce.
[SPEAKER_08]: That sour diesel that we smoke,
400 bucks an ounce, dude, for 28 grams,
[SPEAKER_08]: no love.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'd sell it for 60 bucks an eighth and
they'd be 3.4.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: You would give no love on that bag at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we got the shop going.
[SPEAKER_08]: When we first did it, ounces were 350 just
to keep us in business because we were
[SPEAKER_08]: selling out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we had a big outdoor harvest and we
dropped ounces down to 320.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then our patients were paying 280.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we were seeing better quality because
a lot of our stuff was outdoor.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were growing a large outdoor.
[SPEAKER_08]: We saw the competitors and the two shops
that are still around.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were getting good indoor and stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: I couldn't grow enough to keep it on our
shelves.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a downtown location.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were banging.
[SPEAKER_08]: We dropped prices to 200 bucks an ounce at
one point and that fucked up the whole
[SPEAKER_08]: town.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was getting hate mail, hate calls,
death threats.
[SPEAKER_08]: People were mad at me because I was the
face of that shop.
[SPEAKER_08]: They thought it was all me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of was.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, we pissed off the town and
dropped prices.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you can score a good ounce in this
town for 200 bucks and people still want
[SPEAKER_08]: to find cheaper ounces.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: But for the good dank, it's about 200
bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That dispensary price is usually depending
on where you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about 450 an ounce right now at the
spot, I think, for a good dank ounce.
[SPEAKER_08]: They got some good Durban poison though.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I had to smoke one, that's what I'd go
for.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've thought about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: One more news article.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mentioned the part about Seth Rogen.
[SPEAKER_08]: We may get to that.
[SPEAKER_08]: We may not, you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Seth Rogen wanted to come to Denver and do
a smokeout for his new movie.
[SPEAKER_08]: They wouldn't let him smoke.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of the quick version.
[SPEAKER_08]: He can't smoke in a public place anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: He had to serve tequila.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shitty.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this one is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll try to read that one.
[SPEAKER_08]: We will since you just said that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Indian tribes can legalize pot on their
lands.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the sub headline, if tribes can
balance all the potential social issues,
[SPEAKER_08]: it could be a really huge opportunity,
says Seattle attorney, Anthony Brodman,
[SPEAKER_08]: whose firm represents tribal governments
throughout the West.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this article was published on December
11th.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's written by Jeff Bernard and Garcia
Woznakia from the Associated Press.
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_08]: Department of Justice said Thursday that
American Indian tribes can grow and sell
[SPEAKER_08]: marijuana on their lands, as long as they
follow the same federal conditions laid
[SPEAKER_08]: out for states that have legalized the
drug.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oregon U.S.
[SPEAKER_08]: attorney, Amanda Marshall said Thursday,
the announcement addresses questions
[SPEAKER_08]: raised by tribes about how legalization of
pot in states like Oregon, Washington,
[SPEAKER_08]: and Colorado would apply to Indian lands.
[SPEAKER_08]: Only three tribes have expressed interest
in growing and selling marijuana,
[SPEAKER_08]: said Marshall, who co-chaired a group that
developed the policy.
[SPEAKER_08]: One is in California, one in Washington,
and one state in the Midwest that she did
[SPEAKER_08]: not name.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's been the primary message tribes are
getting to us as U.S.
[SPEAKER_08]: attorneys, Marshall said from Portland.
[SPEAKER_08]: What will the U.S.
[SPEAKER_08]: as federal partners do to assist tribes in
protecting our children and families,
[SPEAKER_08]: our tribal businesses, our tribal housing?
[SPEAKER_08]: How will you help us combat marijuana
abuse in Indian country or Indian county
[SPEAKER_08]: when states are no longer there to partner
with us?
[SPEAKER_08]: Marijuana abuse.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you guys see a lot of that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Over here, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of abuse.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just over here, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because you're just like fucking,
oh, that four grams of cistern hash,
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't need that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just throw that in the trash.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes me laugh because I'm thinking
about what does get abused on Indian
[SPEAKER_02]: reservations I've been on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I was going to ask you, how do you
feel about that too?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, since they're allowed to do
everything that they're, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: now they're making money in collecting tax
for the state, but that all that land is
[SPEAKER_08]: tax free.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I don't, I'm with that, you know,
like we've fucking stolen the whole West
[SPEAKER_08]: from them, but like, if you're going to
make money, but if you're going to sell it
[SPEAKER_08]: to the public as like Indian grown herb,
you should at least pay tax on the land
[SPEAKER_08]: that it's doing that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like for your plot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think this really approaches that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure the state would still require.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're definitely going to take taxes for
the herb, but not for the land.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't re-tax the land.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the whole problem with having an
Indian business on the free land though,
[SPEAKER_08]: is that's the fight they've been fighting
for many years is they won't let them have
[SPEAKER_08]: any kind of businesses on there that's
going to prove profitable.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, when they open a casino or
something like that, it's not on Indian
[SPEAKER_08]: land.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's on, you know, some outskirt land that
they've had to buy like separately and pay
[SPEAKER_08]: land tax on.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's been one of the large arguments
that I've at least seen over the past
[SPEAKER_08]: couple of years.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know enough about that to argue
you.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you what?
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I was asking you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm giving you credit.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Southern boy just made a point.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe 44.
44.
[SPEAKER_08]: Getting it done.
[SPEAKER_08]: Episode 44, hop.
[SPEAKER_08]: Guys, it sounds like we're razzing each
other.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just are because we're bros.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't get mad at us.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to give him a fucking wedgie in
a minute.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_08]: So hard that you can read Hanes on his
forehead.
[SPEAKER_08]: You ever had that kind?
[SPEAKER_08]: Just pull it up right over your forehead.
[SPEAKER_08]: Took a shoe in the back.
[SPEAKER_08]: You reach over here and look for underwear
and when you don't find it, it's going to
[SPEAKER_08]: be really weird for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ladies and gentlemen, this is the episode
with too much information.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to try to read this article with
the throw up that's in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they'll be able to handle it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to read this one next paragraph and
then we can rant on the part that's the
[SPEAKER_08]: elephant in the room, but those social
issues are monumental.
[SPEAKER_08]: Indian tribes have been decimated by drug
abuse, Broadman said.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tribal regulations of pot are going to
have to dovetail with tribal values,
[SPEAKER_08]: making sure marijuana isn't a scourge like
alcohol or tobacco.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to sound racist maybe.
[SPEAKER_08]: Generalization.
[SPEAKER_08]: We all know that natives have trouble with
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not all of them, but the ones that do
really fucking do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Alcohol is a horrible thing that ruins
tons of lives, not just Native Americans.
[SPEAKER_08]: The problem is that you concentrate them
in one area and then you look at them from
[SPEAKER_08]: afar and then you notice similarities and
stereotypes just as in any race or...
Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: How is herb going to be a big problem?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm frustrated.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've seen that it works.
[SPEAKER_08]: Washington hasn't blown up yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's try to replace the alcohol abuse on
the reservation with some cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: enjoyment and then maybe the problems that
are associated with alcohol abuse.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got a whole list of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Could you not look at Alaska almost in
that same way?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, Alaska aren't Native American,
but I mean, a lot of the people up there-
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Alaska, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico,
Oklahoma, Colorado, all those tribes,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, really, really bad problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, not to sound like a dick,
but I've been around a reservation or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, no, I just think it'd be an
awesome development thing for them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Economical development for sure and
getting back to the land.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's read about these taxes part,
the tax part here.
[SPEAKER_08]: It says tribes selling marijuana may not
be subject to state and local taxes,
[SPEAKER_08]: allowing them to undercut off-reservation
sales.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, maybe not.
[SPEAKER_08]: In Washington, taxes add 25% of the price
of pot also in Colorado, but Allison
[SPEAKER_08]: Holcomb- Holcomb?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I said that right.
[SPEAKER_08]: A primary drafter of Washington state's
legalization measure said most people in
[SPEAKER_08]: larger states won't want to drive to
far-flung reservations to buy pot.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, imagine that Indian dank weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, was it here on the podcast that we
had the statistic where we got $30 million
[SPEAKER_08]: just in recreational sales this year?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, and 70% of that came from out of
state.
[SPEAKER_08]: 70% of that came from out of state.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then every time I go in and talk to
the security guard at any dispensary,
[SPEAKER_08]: taxes, fucking taxes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guarantee you 50% of that was taxes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to go kind of fast because we're
approaching an hour.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Yakama Nation, I said that wrong,
Yakama Nation, sorry, I apologize,
[SPEAKER_08]: in Washington state recently passed a ban
on marijuana on the reservation and is
[SPEAKER_08]: trying to halt state regulated pot sales
and grows on lands off the reservation
[SPEAKER_08]: where it still holds hunting and fishing
rights.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they don't want you growing where they
can hunt and fish, which makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if there's actually a conflict
with that or if it's just politics.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of us, they don't want to find our
botanic air bottles in their hunting
[SPEAKER_08]: grounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wonder if there's actually anyone
that wants to grow in their hunting
[SPEAKER_02]: grounds.
[SPEAKER_08]: It actually says the Hoopa Valley tribe in
Northern California has battled illegal
[SPEAKER_08]: pot plantations on its reservation where
they cause environmental damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, that's illegal at any rate.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are 566 tribes around the country
recognized, I'm going to go fast and skim,
[SPEAKER_08]: recognized by federal government.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's going to be a lot of consulting
happening.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Limited resources and a vast amount of
territory to cover.
[SPEAKER_08]: Federal prosecutors will not prosecute
minor cases.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tribal policy is based on the so-called
Cole memo named after the deputy attorney
[SPEAKER_08]: general who wrote it, in which justice
department said the federal government
[SPEAKER_08]: wouldn't intervene as long as legalization
states tightly regulate the drug and take
[SPEAKER_08]: steps to keep it from children,
criminal cartels, and federal property.
[SPEAKER_08]: In all the memo said,
[SPEAKER_08]: guys quit doing that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's a lot on the news about
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Firearms and violence, drug driving and
other health issues, growing marijuana on
[SPEAKER_08]: public lands and possession of marijuana
on federal property.
[SPEAKER_08]: So hopefully eventually they're going to
let the Indians, the natives, you guys,
[SPEAKER_08]: the natives will be able to grow on their
land and maybe have their own Indian
[SPEAKER_08]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they grow some dank, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what they do.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're an agricultural people.
[SPEAKER_08]: They would make the dank.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure there would maybe ones that would
abuse it just like anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_08]: But for the most part, I bet they would be
real respectful about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_08]: Have they not used that as ceremonial
herb?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what they use, but I'm sure
if you gave it to them, it'd be the
[SPEAKER_08]: perfect thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's what the Raspas use for meditation
for a reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that it was around,
but it'd be a more modern thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It grows wild in Iowa.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to get technical, the three of
us abuse cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: If we say we're medical patients,
and the dab we just took was way beyond
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine, now I'm high as shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a medical patient.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look how abusive we are.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at the problems we're causing.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're loud mouths with microphones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to take a nap on the couch the other
night because I took too many dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it had been whiskey or something like
that, we would have thrown up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would have fucking trashed the
neighbor's house.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to quickly, we're going to go
over an hour, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you can stick with us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for hanging in for the random
chatter episode, which might be what I
[SPEAKER_08]: name it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Seth Rogen, I've got two articles here.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was an article posted on December
8th, and then there was a follow-up
[SPEAKER_08]: article posted.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me click it to read the next date.
[SPEAKER_08]: This one came out December 9th.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the night of the 8th must have been the
event.
[SPEAKER_08]: Seth Rogen says he will, this is from
Ricardo Baca at The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Seth Rogen says he will screen his new
film Monday night in a Denver movie
[SPEAKER_08]: theater filled with marijuana smoke and
hundreds of his fans, but will movie
[SPEAKER_08]: theater hotbox actually happen?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Rogen has said he thinks it should
happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: The city of Denver's executive director of
marijuana policy thinks the screening
[SPEAKER_08]: should obey Colorado law, sends the
marijuana smoke.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he planned on debuting his new movie at
the Oriental theater, and he tweeted about
[SPEAKER_08]: it actually.
[SPEAKER_08]: He said, we're going to all get stoned in
the theater.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was kind of a bad idea because
that can't really happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because of the rules here in Colorado,
they are super strict about that kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: So first Rogen started tweeting about
getting high inside the Colorado theater
[SPEAKER_08]: with his fans.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then the host venue, the SCI Film Center
on East Colfax Avenue contacted Sony to
[SPEAKER_08]: tell them the audience couldn't light up
inside their space as it would be against
[SPEAKER_08]: Colorado law.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then Sony told the film center the evening
was no longer happening.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Cannabis reported that Rogen responded
via Twitter that a Colorado screening
[SPEAKER_08]: would still happen only at a different
theater.
[SPEAKER_08]: The old venue is acting lame, so we got a
new one, Rogen tweeted.
[SPEAKER_08]: So where will Rogen land tonight?
[SPEAKER_08]: And remember, this is from a few nights
ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Oriental theater owner, Scott Labrera,
who, dude, we've had some raging dab
[SPEAKER_08]: parties in the Oriental theater.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where the first Dabs of Denver
event was.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's where the secret cup used to be held.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a video on the iRegenetics YouTube
channel of me taking a fat dab inside.
[SPEAKER_08]: I took the first dab in there,
as far as I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I started that party up with a big old
dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: So then he says, tonight's venue is
private and closed to the general public
[SPEAKER_08]: and two promoters who regularly booked the
North Denver room for a pot friendly
dinner.
[SPEAKER_08]: Finally, comedy shows confirmed that
Rogen's screening is scheduled to happen
[SPEAKER_08]: there on Monday night.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's at the Oriental theater owner of
Denver Pot Shop, Denver Relief and comedy
[SPEAKER_08]: production group Sexpot Comedy Told the
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't know if there will be any sort of
consumption or anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to skip a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to scroll through.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he was planning to come and watch this
new movie, which I still haven't read the
[SPEAKER_08]: name of.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have not advertised the name of his
movie in this article at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't it the interview?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't watch TV, so I don't see the
commercial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's no provision in amendment 64
for the on-premise consumption of
[SPEAKER_08]: marijuana, Kilroy said that could have
been put in amendment 64, but it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the voters did not vote for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Kilroy said the Denver police
department and the city's department of
[SPEAKER_08]: excise and license have historically
contacted businesses advertising pot
[SPEAKER_08]: friendly parties ahead of time to talk
about potential violations.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've educated people on what the laws
said, Kilroy, and we've gotten compliance
[SPEAKER_08]: generally.
[SPEAKER_08]: When asked if they were aware of Rogen's
event and without even mentioning the
[SPEAKER_08]: Oriental as a possible location,
Kilroy's office told the Cannabis that
[SPEAKER_08]: Denver police would reach out to the
Oriental theater's owners sometime Monday.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was the original article.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was going to come, he was going to
puff, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So on the next publishing day,
the ninth, Jack Brown from the Cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: said his article highline, no weed,
plenty of tequila at the interview in
[SPEAKER_08]: Denver with Seth Rogen.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there was one thing everyone could
smell Monday night at the Denver screening
[SPEAKER_08]: of the interview, tequila.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that sucks, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: They had to not puff and they had to serve
tequila.
[SPEAKER_08]: What would happen if we replaced every dab
we've taken on the podcast and before the
[SPEAKER_08]: podcast with a shot of tequila?
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you think our night would have
gone?
[SPEAKER_08]: I would have probably pissed myself by now
and thrown up somewhere because that's
[SPEAKER_08]: what tequila makes me do.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would have been really mad and violent
about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, you think you give me shit about
dabs, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm even more of a pussy when it comes to
liquor beer I can deal with.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you don't have to be, not being able
to drink tequila does not mean you're a
[SPEAKER_08]: pussy.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this guy- Would my old lady pounds the
rest of the bottle?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, let's not bring her into this.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the article goes on and says,
when I ran into Rogen on the top floor of
[SPEAKER_08]: the theater in Northwest Denver,
he was adamant that the show was not how
[SPEAKER_08]: he had imagined, how he had imagined the
December 8th event, which had been hyped
[SPEAKER_08]: by Rogen on social media as a 420 friendly
affair.
[SPEAKER_08]: The city said they shut us down if there
was any smoking, he said with the bottle.
[SPEAKER_08]: The bottle of Juarez tequila in hand,
but I can't control what you guys do.
[SPEAKER_08]: It says Rogen couldn't maybe, but- Oh,
Rogen couldn't, but maybe the- What's
[SPEAKER_08]: that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Cadre?
[SPEAKER_08]: Cadder?
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never seen that word.
[SPEAKER_08]: The big ass group of secret service-esque
security personnel definitely enforced the
[SPEAKER_08]: Colorado clean indoor air rules,
asking several people in my section to
[SPEAKER_08]: leave during the screening for using vape
pens.
[SPEAKER_08]: There were also rumored to be a number of
undercover police officers in the crowd in
[SPEAKER_08]: case there was any smoking taking place.
[SPEAKER_08]: Guys, this is the shit that happened in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: You think you're going to go somewhere and
puff?
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not.
[SPEAKER_08]: Be careful, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not going to happen at the Oriental
theater.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the places it does happen at,
we keep our mouth shut about because we
[SPEAKER_02]: like doing it there.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of true.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of true.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't see pictures of people standing
around in circles and sidewalks.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just not something that we take
pictures of.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're here and you're cool and we know
you and stuff, we'll grab you and take you
[SPEAKER_08]: to a place.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll definitely come with us.
[SPEAKER_08]: The cops don't go in the mountains here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't blow our dab spots.
[SPEAKER_08]: We found some really cool adventurous dab
spots.
[SPEAKER_08]: So as the duo took stage, Rogan started
things off by saying, fuck the police,
[SPEAKER_08]: which elicited big cheers from the pro-pot
crowd.
[SPEAKER_08]: Audience questions range from actual
threats by North Korea over the film
[SPEAKER_08]: because Rogan having North Korea
threatened nuclear war is not ideal yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: We won't even go into that part.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Rogan made sure to correct a question
about smoking bowls.
[SPEAKER_08]: He said, first I smoked joints five to
seven a day, but on a night that was light
[SPEAKER_08]: on both joints and bowls, more were left
simply handing him various pot products
[SPEAKER_08]: for later.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the state that famously legalized it,
most of the weed smoking, surreptitiously,
[SPEAKER_08]: that's a good fucking word, took place in
a side alley next to the theater.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe next year, Rogan explained.
[SPEAKER_08]: The way things are trending with pot
consumption enforcement, perhaps next year
[SPEAKER_08]: looks even worse.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they're really cracking down.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can't puff here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to be in a private house.
[SPEAKER_08]: They want you at home smoking your pot.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty much the only place they want
you doing it.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are a few hotels that advertise 420
friendly.
[SPEAKER_08]: They do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our favorite hotel that we drive past that
we see that advertised.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember the name.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's in Manitou Springs.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's right outside of Manitou.
[SPEAKER_08]: As we head back from the Monte factor,
you see the 420 friendly sign.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've taken down the 420 friendly part.
[SPEAKER_08]: It no longer says that.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're probably still 420 friendly,
but they probably had to just quit
[SPEAKER_08]: advertising such just to keep themselves
out of trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: The micro-tel here in Pueblo is 420
friendly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they are.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got a friend that works over there.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up, D, if you're listening?
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to Big D and Little D.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we stayed there when we first got
over this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: They only have a couple of rooms that are
actually 420 friendly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just ask.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they say no, then there's
measurements to take, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, guys, it looks like it's about
time to wrap up the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been going for an hour and seven
minutes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope your ADD didn't kick in.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you made it through the whole show.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't forget to check out all of our
sponsors.
[SPEAKER_08]: Guys, pretty soon we'll have King Kola
back on the show to talk more about
[SPEAKER_08]: organics.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a couple of questions about MAP
and DAP for him.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to do eventually, we're going
to do an additives lesson.
[SPEAKER_08]: I promise you, since I've taken this new
job at the spot being the master grower,
[SPEAKER_08]: I do promise you that it will not deter or
detract from the podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're still going to do our best to put
out kick-ass podcasts.
[SPEAKER_08]: It may actually help me do some hydro
lessons for you because everything we're
[SPEAKER_08]: doing there is on large scale commercial
hydro.
[SPEAKER_08]: I get to kind of expand my hydro
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to do lessons on additives.
[SPEAKER_08]: I may have said that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I read that line,
like what to add to your shit during what
[SPEAKER_08]: week so that you know when to boost it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We talked about basic news.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we need to talk about additives.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're working towards episode 50 also.
[SPEAKER_08]: 50 is going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe just be like a recap.
[SPEAKER_08]: Weren't we just like celebrating 25?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think so, 25 weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you guys have been listening for a
long time and you've got some favorite
[SPEAKER_08]: moments of the show or some highlights or
something in a highlight reel,
[SPEAKER_08]: message me and let me know when that was
and we can talk about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll kind of reminisce on episode 50.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see who we can't get to the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I can set up like 22 microphones and
get everybody that's ever been on onto the
[SPEAKER_08]: show all at once or something.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll just have another spot like you did.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like we did at the break yard,
go try to find a public place.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we can do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: There is not going to be, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's give away something free.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies is going
to step it up and give away something.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Something cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sure you got, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I got a t-shirt or a hat pin or
something.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some stickers and stuff, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys got any shout outs or anything to
make?
[SPEAKER_08]: Mine was for you, man, honestly.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, like Bender, of course,
he's keeping the service running.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey Fisher, cut faster.
[SPEAKER_08]: See, I feel bad for him now because he was
like, I don't want to listen to your
[SPEAKER_08]: voice, you know, last week.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now he's going to have to listen to
both of our voices this week.
[SPEAKER_08]: So how long can we go on and just sit here
and give him shit and just be in the other
[SPEAKER_08]: room?
[SPEAKER_08]: Just set him up with the microphone and
just walk away.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a rapper.
[SPEAKER_08]: He is a rapper.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fish is a rapper.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's tired of hearing your voice on a
recording.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell him, do you have some sympathy?
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody expects everyone to listen to him
rapping the same shit over and over.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just likes to complain about
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: When he goes to work, he's like,
nevermind, I'm going to go say it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a semi-family-friendly podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just went almost full construction talk
on you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a love-hate relationship they got,
you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_08]: They love to piss each other the fuck
right off.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's unique.
[SPEAKER_08]: I tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_08]: Makes it fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: Makes work fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it does.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't kill each other at work,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: What up, Fish?
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me know when you're performing again.
[SPEAKER_08]: Give him a shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's always- Dank Uno Gros.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uno, like Spanish.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because he's from Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did most of my shout outs at the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to thank you guys for coming on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Number 44, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was sitting at home eating dinner,
so you're like podcasting.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm always down.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was planning a podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: I really had shit planned out.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't sound like it on this episode.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad you brought him because at least
he had something going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jesse's so damn cool that he messaged me
around six with podcast as his question
[SPEAKER_08]: mark.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, yeah, dude, we'll do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wasn't going to bug him.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to have him come over and just
going to let him do his night,
[SPEAKER_08]: but he wanted to, so I'm so glad he came.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you guys for coming.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make sure you listen all the way up to
episode number 50, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounds like Hygro is going to have some
sort of prizes for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking a light setup.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depends on shipping and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll figure it out, though.
[SPEAKER_08]: Email me some of your favorite moments and
stuff, guys, which you want to talk about
[SPEAKER_08]: on episode 50.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll reminisce.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll have a lot of fun on number 50.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll take a lot of dabs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe that'll be the one when I take a
half gram dab at the end of the show or a
[SPEAKER_08]: gram dab at the end of the show because I
need to retire this big ass dab phase
[SPEAKER_08]: that's been going on in my life.
[SPEAKER_08]: It hurts now.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's starting to kill me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we play fiddle music or something?
[SPEAKER_08]: Some violin, soft instrumental shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Monte music.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Big, huge shout out to the Monte factor.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got some loose leaf Monte in a bag to
take with me last time.
[SPEAKER_08]: These guys are super kind.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, the next time I go there,
I may stray from the Monte.
[SPEAKER_08]: I may try a chai.
[SPEAKER_08]: My buddy that works there last time,
I was putting honey in my Monte and he
[SPEAKER_08]: gave me the, come here, and I went over
there and he's making himself a chai for
[SPEAKER_08]: him and he poured a little bit of it into
a little to-go cup for me and he goes,
[SPEAKER_08]: try this.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the chai.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was just like, get out of here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Take this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was on my way out and dude, it was the
dankness.
[SPEAKER_08]: I may need to, what time is it?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's nine o'clock.
[SPEAKER_08]: How much crack was in it?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think there was much, but I've had
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: He got you hooked though.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got his own special kind of crack.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was so tasty.
[SPEAKER_08]: It had the deliciousness.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't be looking at the clock because I'm
down.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to call my girlfriend and see if
she wants to go to Monte with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not out of like a milk jug or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually like make their own.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, they make everything there.
[SPEAKER_08]: They make everything there.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Monte factor in Manitou Springs,
you guys, it's my little secret.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you go there, tell them, hey,
I heard about this place from the
[SPEAKER_08]: iGrowCulture podcast and they don't know
who I am.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a flyer.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a flyer back there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going so long.
[SPEAKER_08]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you guys all, I'm not going to edit
this.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is how it's going to go out too,
guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no editing in the shows lately.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kind of proud of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not cutting anything out.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to go out just like it
happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a while actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had to stop recording one time a couple
shows ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jesse turned like olive green on me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice construction worker red.
[SPEAKER_08]: My shout outs all go to Angela,
my tremor friends, Mike and Adam here.
[SPEAKER_08]: It still is Overgrow the Gov on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just not Twitter.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to, yeah, do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do your stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my shout out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Adam's mic is off now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Put you back on, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just picking on you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Put you back on.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't do that to you.
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds rude.
[SPEAKER_08]: It feels rude as fuck.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, guys, now that the show is
over, it pretty much is over, but please
[SPEAKER_08]: do listen to this.
