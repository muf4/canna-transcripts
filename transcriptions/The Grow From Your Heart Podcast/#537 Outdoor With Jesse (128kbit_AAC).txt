[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not just kissing their ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like we check on each other and
during the covid times, they were
[SPEAKER_03]: messaging me every three or four days.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them would say, what's up,
bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: You healthy?
[SPEAKER_03]: You safe?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that kind of stuff goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_03]: It means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the part of the show where we talk
about what we're smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse, I'll let you go first.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've rolled up a big fat joint over
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smelled delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you puffing on?
[SPEAKER_02]: It is some outdoor from last year that my
dad grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a Yeti OG times bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that sounds great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know both of those strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember the Yeti being gassy,
kind of feely and funky.
[SPEAKER_03]: And bubblegum, of course, has got that
sweet bubblegum flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to old man Jesse.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know if we should say his
name on here, but big shout out to that
[SPEAKER_03]: guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jay, big shout out to Jay, the old pirate.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, you should see this guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been growing longer than you've been
alive and he's still a bad guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a bad motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: He grows pretty decent.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he does a damn good job.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said that was outdoor and I was
surprised.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, oh man, I just said outdoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smelled really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job, Jay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job, brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do approve.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the point of the show where we do
shout outs to our friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I didn't tell you what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to get moving too quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am dabbing Tropicana Cookies live batter
from Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tropicana Cookies, Tropicana and Cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's orange.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's citrusy, funky, and then a little bit
of spicy from the cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to crack it open.
[SPEAKER_03]: It rips.
[SPEAKER_03]: It rips.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a lot of limonene and citrusy
turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what that citrus turp is
called off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funky and almost gross and I really
enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like gross aromas.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the Tropicana Cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's got me out of control and
rambly today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse took a smaller dab of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took a large dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse put the joint out after the dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that tells you how that Tropicana
Cookies punched us in the face.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now this is a officially the point in the
show where we do shout outs to the folks
[SPEAKER_03]: who support us on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start off with the big Grow From

[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that is all of the business stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I got to give an update.
[SPEAKER_03]: The led plants look amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse saw the plants that are under the
LEDs.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: They look great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm pretty impressed, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: You heard it from Jesse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse is hard to impress.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those little lights rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a new millennium nutrients and
Canon LEDs in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what's doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: When he saw him, he went, oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he was pretty excited about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is all of the business we're going
to cover for today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse is back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you guys listen to this podcast,
you know that Jesse is my outdoor guru
[SPEAKER_03]: when it comes to asking questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse is the guy I turn to.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is outdoor season.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the time this episode comes out,
we are a little bit late for outdoor
[SPEAKER_03]: season, but we're busy people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse's been in Mexico and Oklahoma and
all over the damn place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell them where else you've been,
if you want to share any of your
[SPEAKER_03]: adventures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vegas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't going to say Vegas.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the place that I left out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, do I say Vegas?
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to shout out to Chris Medzen,
his IG name.
[SPEAKER_02]: I doubt he's listening, but he got to show
us the grow that is associated to Planet
[SPEAKER_02]: 13 dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was impressive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the biggest dispensary in Vegas,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That place is huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a fucking bar in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a bar where you can get a drink and
just chill while you're waiting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a brewery.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's insane, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a bit much.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's distracting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to buy some weed and have a beer
and meet some people and mingle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that sounds awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So shout out to that guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody tagged that guy that you just
shouted out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody tag him so he hears this episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just got a really cool shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a considering how much
cannabis, you know, they're not the only
[SPEAKER_02]: grow that supplies to Planet 13,
but they do supply a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a pretty small group,
you know, relatively speaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was impressive to see its
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you got a small place,
I have known a lot of small places that
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had to really bang it out and keep it
going.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's almost harder in a small
place, because if you miss a couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: days on the rhythm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, dude, you're fucked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't cut clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: On this day and pot those this day and
then move this room, everything falls out
[SPEAKER_03]: of place.
[SPEAKER_03]: You never get it back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Never, never.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you're one full week behind.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we expect what is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Five point seven crops per year.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do nine weeks divided or however
many 72 weeks, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Fifty two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fifty two weeks a year divided by nine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Five point seven crops or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we expect that many crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've worked at a place that I expected 52
crops and I gave it to some places.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some owners, you say they say,
hey, how long does this crop take to
[SPEAKER_03]: finish?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you go nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: They go, we'll be back in eight weeks to
collect our money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you go, wait, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: How does this?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then every time you see them,
like, so seven weeks sounds beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: How much are you going to pull?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you say maybe a pound of light and
they go two pounds of light.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back in six weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just gets tighter and tighter every
time you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should focus down.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing a podcast about outdoor
growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Suddenly we're talking about commercial
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, Jesse is my outdoor
cultivation guru.
[SPEAKER_03]: How does that make you feel, bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're my guru for outdoor growing,
which means now you've become a large
[SPEAKER_03]: audience as outdoor guru.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're the outdoor Yoda today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just a guy that's fucked up a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I say.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm no expert.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just an idiot with a whole bunch of
experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've just done it a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think the number one question right
now, today we're recording and I know this
[SPEAKER_03]: episode is going to be delayed because
we're recording.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be, yeah, I'm ahead of
myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today is the 16th of May.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's starting to get really nice outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had some consistently warm days.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've also had some hail storms.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be some stuff to address.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the golden question right now is
when do we put, and keep in mind,
[SPEAKER_03]: you guys, we are in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are on mountain time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are in Southern Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe some of Jesse's guidance will also
relate to Oklahoma because he works down
[SPEAKER_03]: there quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But right now, most of what we talk about
will probably be based on Colorado and the
[SPEAKER_03]: mountain time zone on the mountain area.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the golden question is when do we put
our plants outside, dude?
[SPEAKER_03]: When would be safe to start putting our
cannabis plants outside for the season?
[SPEAKER_02]: In most of Colorado and most of the
country, you're totally safe to be
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoors right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of Mother's Day is what you shoot
for.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Colorado, it's not unusual to get a
cold snap.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've passed that part though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's at least here in Southern
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you say Mother's Day and that's ironic
because we got a serious fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: thunderstorm on Mother's Day with some
hail and some shit this year on Mother's
[SPEAKER_03]: Day.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had hail over on the east side on
Thursday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to pull my car in the garage a
couple of nights ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: I almost did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, it's close.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost that hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're brave, you can definitely have
your plants out right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I planted some today.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're behind schedule.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, we're both busy guys,
but put them outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get them outside because we should have
had them out there already, it sounds
[SPEAKER_03]: like.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think the next question people are
going to ask is when should we expect,
[SPEAKER_03]: and this will be strain dependent.
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_03]: When should we expect things to start
flowering?
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to the last question real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have your plants out,
don't feel that you're late or behind the
[SPEAKER_02]: curve or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you haven't missed anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got plenty of time to still get your
plants out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when to expect stuff to start
flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically here in Colorado, it's going to
be towards the end of July or August.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to make a note of that because I
ask you this question every year,
[SPEAKER_03]: Mother's Day and then end of July.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most strains, especially like the ones
that are easier trigger, like Indica's
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of the ones you should have selected.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've even seen them start packing pistols
and making a bud growth in late July.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've still got a good 45 days at this
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the time this comes out, we'll still
have a good month of veg.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're growing outdoors in your
neighborhood or something, you don't need
[SPEAKER_03]: giant massive plants and they're going to
get big outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys be prepared.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're growing indoors and you're used
to the way they grow indoors, when you go
[SPEAKER_03]: outdoors, you're going to say,
holy shit every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it outdoors, there's kind of,
you know, there's a indoors, everyone
[SPEAKER_02]: looks at it as a veg and a bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, in outdoor growing that transition
period kind of counts as a growth phase,
[SPEAKER_02]: in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even once they start flowering,
they're still going to stretch more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then what you would see, you know,
even see in an indoor setting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, the sun is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like the most powerful light that
you could ever imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you got a good sun, um, uh,
consistent and good watering and healthy
[SPEAKER_02]: soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you've given me a couple of options on
which way to segue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you said strain selection a moment
ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are some things we should think about
for selecting strains to put outdoors?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, in most parts of the country,
um, you can run pretty much anything you
[SPEAKER_02]: want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just stay away from like hazes,
uh, no Hawkins, um, no ties, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that, that stuff's never going to finish
up unless you got a greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, um, you know, that's, uh,
let's say in Oklahoma, they, they've got a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of humidity, especially late in the
season.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to go for a bud that's kind of
airy, not super compact, um, in,
in college.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado, it gets cold here early.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so the buds that are really compact
and have really dense or the plants that
[SPEAKER_02]: are really compact and have really dense
buds tend to finish earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to think about like regional
differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, what, what does your region require?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, right now, one of the most
common questions I get for seed requests
[SPEAKER_03]: are what are things that are really mildew
resistant?
[SPEAKER_03]: They want things that are powdery mildew
and boy, try this resistant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of these questions are coming
from people on May or from Maine and,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, on the coast up there in the Northeast
because they've get, they get a shorter
[SPEAKER_03]: season.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets colder.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets mildewy and they need stuff that
finishes early.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to plug my own brand for something
that is from my line, a shameless plug,
[SPEAKER_03]: something that is known to be powdery
mildew resistant, boy, try this resistant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also the aroma keeps the pests away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, morning dew and Prana are great
crosses for outdoor all across the
[SPEAKER_03]: country.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sun kiss is also really great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the, uh, the orange chasm works great
outdoors, but I've noticed that that
[SPEAKER_03]: morning do anything that came from the
grateful dog has been known to be,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, that grateful dog plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a powdery mildew resistant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's boy, try this resistant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had PM in grow rooms before where
every plant except the grateful dog has
[SPEAKER_03]: been hit with PM.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's one that I can say put that
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything crossed with flow or a grateful
dog will do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ short stuff does really good outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, flow has always been a, a favorite of
mine for outdoor in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've grown it at pretty high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Elevation and I've grown it in the dry hot
parts too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, uh, the, the cut that goes around
here in Colorado, uh, and the one I
[SPEAKER_02]: believe Jeff worked with is, uh,
is a very resilient plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, that's why I worked with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why I recommend that one to my
beginner growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: When people are brand new, I'm like,
get, get this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause flow gross, you can, you can pee on
it and kick it over.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you go over tomorrow,
it will have picked itself up and up right
[SPEAKER_03]: at the pot and trimmed itself and it'll be
ready to go for you again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it'll make you feel like you're the
best grower in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I am, when you said it was the cut
that I had part of me felt weird inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I almost wish I hadn't gotten rid of
it, but, uh, there was a point in my life
[SPEAKER_03]: where at home, I was growing flow at work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was growing flow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ran a dispensary where I did the growing
before and after work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then during the day I did the bud
tending.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would sell the herb.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my house, my bedroom, my workspace,
my hair, my car, my life, my dog,
[SPEAKER_03]: everything smelled like flow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also sometimes I was like,
can I smell something?
[SPEAKER_03]: Something different?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I just want to not smell flow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I grew tired of it and I let it go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bred, I made a bunch of crosses to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made a bunch of seeds of, uh,
Prana is the cross that came from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then one day I retired her bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: She, she got the choppity chop chop.
[SPEAKER_03]: I gave out a bunch of cuts of her first
because that's what you do, but she got
[SPEAKER_03]: the chop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I have a strain that is very similar
to that story that you work with that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: not going to name the stream, but I can
relate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I know which one by the look on your
face.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could tell that's a, that's a really
popular strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, I think the run of it I've got
going now will probably be it's a,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's final destination.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm tired of that as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, if we're talking about the same
one, it's a pain in the ass to grow and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not fruitful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I'm a breeder and it doesn't make
seeds, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can pollinate that thing at just the
right time or just the wrong time where
[SPEAKER_03]: both of them and, uh, the plant next to it
will get 300 to 500 seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that one gave me six, not 600,
six seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: And five of them looked good.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them was kind of iffy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you guys, I'm talking about the Mac.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what plant Jesse is talking
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to divulge secrets here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I don't like to leave my listeners in
the dark.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all going, what fucking straight
was that yelling into their phones?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so strain selection is really
important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Jesse said, don't pick a haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want something unless you've got
a greenhouse and you plan on keeping it
[SPEAKER_03]: warm.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to put a heater out there or
something, uh, something that is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: go 70 ish days is probably the max you
want to put outside in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: The golden goat will finish on time for
you out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear people stressing over the golden
goat.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, it's Halloween.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to cut down this fucking golden
goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you can make golden goat turn purple
outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the, not the bud so much, maybe like
the outside hairs, but the leaves turn
[SPEAKER_02]: like this crazy purple color.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do this weird crinkle sometimes
toward the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: So be prepared, have a plant that can
handle, uh, mildew, powdery mildew,
[SPEAKER_03]: boy tritis, something that is bug
resistant, something with a good finish
[SPEAKER_03]: time and something that can handle
temperature swings.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to see a lot of crazy
temperature swings all across the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: The planet is all weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a hail storm and a super hot day
and a cold night all within one sandwich
[SPEAKER_03]: time period here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wore shorts, long sleeves,
a t-shirt and no shoes all on the same
[SPEAKER_03]: day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's add in structure too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, a lot of the really crazy,
uh, like Cali poly hybrids that are really
[SPEAKER_02]: popular right now don't have the best
structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I, I, I've seen plants like that
just completely get torn apart outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause they can't take it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were bred for, uh, Instagram instead
of for growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh, shit, what was I going to say?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nevermind.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll come back to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just yell it out when it does.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, what issues do you think people
should be prepared for?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we're going to get crazy weather.
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep talking about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are other things that you think
people should be prepared for outside?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you run into?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, watering can be an issue, especially
if you're growing in pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can grow in the, in the ground,
I highly recommend it, especially if,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, if, if you're newer to this,
um, the, the, the earth is really
[SPEAKER_02]: forgiving.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, make, make sure you get some nice
mulch around the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and a steady consistent watering,
you know, you don't have to overwater it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anything, maybe a little underwater it,
um, to help make the plant tougher,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, in veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but if you have a good mulched ground,
um, that really does you, you're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself a really big favor by doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just makes it so much easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was going to ask you, pots are in the
ground and you say, go right in the
[SPEAKER_03]: ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, do it however you have to,
but, uh, if you can't go in the ground,
[SPEAKER_02]: go in the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if you have to do pots, uh,
I'd recommend like a fabric pot,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, or maybe some of those fabric beds,
um, cover it in, uh, in a white plastic as
[SPEAKER_02]: a trick I've used to keep the pot from
heating up so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the middle of the summer,
most pots are black.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that, that shit gets like scorching
hot, like 140 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just roasts the roots and it just sucks
the water out of the, the soil so fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so some of the tricks I've used is
covering it in panda plastic with the
[SPEAKER_02]: white side out, um, or cover building up a
mound of mulch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, around the pot itself, you could use
straw, you could use, uh, wood chips,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, anything you need to get it
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just something that's organic and it's
going to hold some water and has air
[SPEAKER_02]: pockets.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little insulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like a swamp cooler.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys got to think about water.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something I didn't write down on my
notes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have big plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have access to water?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're growing out on the farm
somewhere, can you get water there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a truck?
[SPEAKER_03]: You may need to haul water in.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't have a major long hose or
some irrigation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of you may be just growing in the
backyard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of you may be doing some struggle
grow this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about how you're going to get the
water out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plan ahead, set yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I wrote down weather it's going to get
hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to get cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to rain and it's going to hail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, do you have an affordable idea of how
to protect these plants from hail or do we
[SPEAKER_03]: just leave them out there and hope for the
best?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it kind of depends on the size of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if there, if you know you got a
hailstorm coming and you, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: early in the season still, um,
go, go throw a barrel or a bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over that, that bitch, even a box.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, last year I had, um, on the day that
I'd planted something like a hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: tomatoes, like literally as we had
finished planning the last one,
[SPEAKER_02]: here comes the hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're running around out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, luckily there was a hundred empty five
gallon pots at this farm and, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: we covered each, every single one of the
tomato plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as we got it done, the hell was
gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just testing you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You thought you got done early that day
and you were going to go smoke and it was
[SPEAKER_03]: like, did that sound really cool?
[SPEAKER_03]: And all the hail was hitting those five
gallon pots on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like a really bad drum circle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, probably at first it did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I, that was definitely a panic thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you've got a big trash can or
something, anything, you can just flip
[SPEAKER_03]: upside down and create a little shelter
for these plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys be prepared.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, what else do you got for us,
bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I mean, I've seen just a single layer
of plastic stop somehow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so maybe like a PVC hoop over your
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, whatever you got to do to
like hanging plastic or tarp over it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, that, that can totally
protect it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, even chicken wire, um, to a certain
degree can, can, uh, break up hell and
[SPEAKER_02]: protect your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make it smaller instead of big asteroids
coming in.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: That really helps.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are some good ideas on how to
protect it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, what are some of the pests that we're
going to be facing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, a aphids, uh, probably, uh,
the Miller moths.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh God, I hate those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't talk about them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aphids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you generally don't see spider mites
outside unless your plants already had
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you took them out there and that's,
you know, maybe a small infestation here
[SPEAKER_02]: or there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, I can walk around in the
prairie and find spider mites on,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, um, shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that big old plant that makes the
tumbleweeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I can't remember its actual name,
tumbleweeds just before their tumbleweeds
[SPEAKER_02]: walk out in the prairie and look at one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could totally find spider mites on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it breaks off and blows and then
it just comes all down the street and hits
[SPEAKER_02]: the house and you hate tumbleweeds for a
whole nother reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What about those aphids dude?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we get rid of aphids?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen a lot of people popping up with
aphids lately.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your recommendation for aphids?
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's like some crazy aphids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aphids in California that I don't know
shit about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there it's like a super aphid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the aphids that I have dealt with here
in Colorado is what I call a tomato aphid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and they're the little green fuckers
that you find on the stem above the
[SPEAKER_02]: ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, those have never been a big challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, just BT.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bacillus thuringiensis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, um, uh, what's in the Monterey spray?
[SPEAKER_02]: Spinosad?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spinosad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spinosad is banned by the MED in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't use that one in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Use the Bacillus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always, always check before you spray
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't take our word for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's your job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why you're the lead grower and the
pesticide applicator.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Write it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're, you're, you're supposed to check
it every time before you apply it is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the ultimate safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: The commercial grow industry has fucking
corrupted us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spinosad or Bacillus, uh, should typically
wipe those out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if you find them, look for the ant
pile that is probably pretty close to your
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those bastards probably had something
to do with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, look up the, uh, relationship between
ants and, uh, and aphids on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're really high someday,
it'll blow your mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: They come together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so do you think, uh, should we be
applying any pesticides like spray
[SPEAKER_03]: pesticides outside?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is that something you try to avoid?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, in the past, I've done like,
uh, aloe vera or in the most recent past,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, I've done like aloe vera, EM1 kind of,
uh, mixture once a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something very gentle, very non
disruptive, non intrusive to the
[SPEAKER_03]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mix in the OHN with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the, um, I did the cheater way and
bought this stuff from Chris Trump.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, but, uh, I mix in a little of
that, little of that, little of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, other things I've used is the,
the SNS 207.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, totally feel safe telling people they
can use that once a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and keep in mind, you guys,
when you're spraying, you can spray
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever you want on your plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse and I can't stop you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't tell you what to do, but you're
also spraying our land.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I know that that little patch is
yours, but it gets into the water.
[SPEAKER_03]: The wind takes it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just your earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just be conscious of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't, don't fuck up our earth too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of be cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you leave some for my kids and your
kids and shit and Jesse's kids,
[SPEAKER_03]: if he ever has any, just leave some earth
for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: If, if you need to use like some really
hardcore chemicals outside, you need to
[SPEAKER_02]: like really evaluate what you're doing
with your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, cause, cause growing cannabis outside
it's pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you, I think if you have a spider mite,
whatever eats a spider mite, we'll come
[SPEAKER_03]: and eat that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then whatever eats that bug should
come eat that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should just have a small roving
population of things that eliminate
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why the cover crop and the mulch is
so important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, cover crop and mulch around that will
build your, your little insect community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a hierarchy going on,
um, of things that eat other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and as soon as you have that in
check, um, your, your pest problems are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to diminish, uh, rapidly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nature loves to create balance.
[SPEAKER_03]: It loves to, that's kind of one of its
favorite things to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so the small bugs are obvious.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get pests.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get, uh, in Colorado,
we get those little fucking caterpillars,
[SPEAKER_03]: the worms, the orange worms that turn into
caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the only place I've ever seen
those is in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I've seen them everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get those terrible fucking things,
but then there are the other things we got
[SPEAKER_03]: to think about things like, uh,
and people are going to think I'm crazy,
[SPEAKER_03]: but where we live, this is an option.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get deer in your weed garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get cats.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cats are common cats of the look on your
face, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like a couple of cats have gotten
one or three of your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh God, more than three cats will eat
plants when they're young.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it's really frustrating because
they can, the little fat asses just
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking eat the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, um, squirrels, gophers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also will use your potting soil as a
litter box.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're growing in a container.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so be aware of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come outside to your, your no-till bed and
find a big old cat deuce in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when you're like laying down a
couple of pounds of cover crop and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, really digging in there and what
the fuck's this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's just not broken up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, damn.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do we keep those larger critters
out of our stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, chicken wire would work good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, something that doesn't hurt
anyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking chicken wire is great for all
kinds of shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just build like a barrel around it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say you're like in a hundred gallon pod
or, you know, um, or you got your,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're planting the hole in the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, do you do like a three foot,
four foot around it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, at a certain point, uh, um,
deer don't, you know, deer really only an
[SPEAKER_02]: issue when they're, when you're in veg,
um, they, they go for the nice soft new
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and when they're really, really small,
in my experience, someone may say
[SPEAKER_02]: something different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about that crazy deer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: From what I've seen, once they're in
flower, you don't really have to worry
[SPEAKER_02]: about them too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, bears, um, if you use a lot of,
uh, good smell and shit or what a bear
[SPEAKER_02]: thinks is good smell and shit,
which is like blood mill, fish mill,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and you're in an area where there are
bears.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is very likely they're going to come
dig your hole up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen that happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: People may be saying bears.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are bears 25 miles west of us right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are bears.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh hell, not even 25 miles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen bears just down on the river.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's six miles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh, yeah, it's really freaky when the
bear takes a nap in the, in the hole and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and one of your guys walks into the patch
and sees the bear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I've had a couple.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm from California, but I'm a
Colorado boy now and I've done a lot of,
[SPEAKER_03]: spent a lot of time in the San Isabel
national forest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, bears are some of the scary
bears and big cats are the scariest
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cats scare the shit out of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bears definitely scare me, but we don't
have like the crazy huge, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking Leonardo DiCaprio fucking bears in
Colorado, but, um, uh, they're definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: still scary.
[SPEAKER_03]: The scariest part is when you see a cat in
the mountains, like a bobcat and then you
[SPEAKER_03]: don't see it anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the worst cause you're like,
where the fuck did it go?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to die.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where did it go?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to die.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like all you can do is turn on your camera
phone and hope to film your own death.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I did because that's how my
mind worked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, dude, do you think it is beneficial to
release beneficial insects outdoors or is
[SPEAKER_03]: that something that you should just let
nature handle on its own?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, do you have an area that will keep
beneficial insects?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, would be a question I would ask myself
before I did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if I'm growing in a dirt lot,
um, no, and they're not going to hang out
[SPEAKER_02]: on the plants forever either.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, yeah, once there's nothing there
for them to eat, they die or take off and
[SPEAKER_03]: go find something.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just like us.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to get food and get laid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when that's not happening,
they leave.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to spend their entire
life on the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: There has to be something else keeping
them there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so in some context, it could be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't give you a better answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can look me in the face and say,
I don't know because that's, that's more
[SPEAKER_03]: respectful than just making some shit up
for everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be something I would consider.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's in the budget and if you're in the
right invite, and I'm sure you can go to
[SPEAKER_03]: many of the websites that offer beneficial
insects, you can kind of, they show you
[SPEAKER_03]: what environment they prefer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you've got high humidity,
don't buy this.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you got high humidity, do buy this one
and they'll give you guidance like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe, maybe if you find the right one,
I just wondered if that was because I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't like spraying outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't like to put sprays.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting away from sprays indoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm starting to not like it so much.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And beneficials are cost-effective.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you learn how to do it, uh,
you don't lose, people think you're
[SPEAKER_03]: throwing them away when you harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you colonized and veg, you know,
I'm getting carried away, but I think
[SPEAKER_03]: beneficial is outdoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I did outdoor, I'd probably just flood
the veg plants indoors and then put them
[SPEAKER_03]: outside and hope they carry through those
beneficials.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go right outside with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that there's a strong,
say you have a good environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's a strong chance that those
beneficials could reproduce and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and come back even the next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, considering the context.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just burrow down and lay a bunch of
eggs and the legs eggs over winter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then yeah, maybe next summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got more predators, more security
guards working for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so something else on beneficials
outdoors, um, I've never liked using like
[SPEAKER_02]: the lace wings and some of the big bigger
insects, um, in, in, inside commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I found that they'll get stuck in
the bud and you know, that that's as bad
[SPEAKER_02]: of a problem as a spider might.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but outdoors, I would feel that's a
lot better, um, uh, setting to use some of
[SPEAKER_02]: those bigger ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: The lace wings that come on the cards that
are in the eggs, they turn into the
[SPEAKER_03]: larvae.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll look like a little crocodile or a
dinosaur when you put them in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those things are f*****g ferocious.
[SPEAKER_03]: They will eat the s**t out of everything
that falls by them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I highly recommend those.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're expensive, but they work so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they go after the, um, uh,
after the, the bud worms too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I've seen those bud worms destroy
giant plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get in there, just burrow all through
the buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so we had mentioned that earlier,
uh, Spindle sad or BT sprayed early.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, though the eggs get laid in those buds
when they're, when the buds are only a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of weeks into flower and then they
don't hatch till the end of flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, they get put there early and
they're not a problem till the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've seen people smoke those worms,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get lit too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or at least they said they did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something I didn't realize for years is
that those worms actually can cause,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, uh, not just, uh, the disgusting
little spot they leave, but they,
[SPEAKER_02]: they cause some kind of blood mold to
happen too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, they started affecting that plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they just spread other shitting in
there and living in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a whole other, it's a parasite in
your, in your buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I may have even said on one of these
old podcasts that, uh, Oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I just cut around that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I now I probably wouldn't recommend
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't it great how much stuff we've
learned and how we could just come out and
[SPEAKER_03]: say, Oh, so a couple of years ago,
I was a dipshit about this move and I've
[SPEAKER_03]: learned that that's not the way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's empowering to be able to change
your point of view and, and to learn new
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the most serious flex you can do
for yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I didn't write a book.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel if I wrote a book by the time the
book was at the last page, I'd have to
[SPEAKER_03]: just start back over and go, this is all
out of date here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We updated this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Could be some shit I've said about plants
that I've grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a whole episode coming up about
led lighting pretty soon that is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: blow people's minds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, we're talking about problems we
may face.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, there's another big problem we have
not addressed yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, cops and thieves, dude, you have any
advice to keep?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, cops out of the grow and to keep
thieves out of the grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, keep your plants completely
non-visible from the street or where other
[SPEAKER_02]: people are, uh, hide them in your yard as
well as you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh, make sure your fences are tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's a crack in your fence,
uh, people can see in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and that's the first best thing you
can do against both of those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, against cops, you know, keep your
numbers down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, it's hard to keep thieves
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been ripped off, uh, very seriously a
couple of times, um, for, for a whole lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of plants, um, legal limits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, those were the good old days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, uh, you know, there's,
there's, uh, don't get a gun involved is
[SPEAKER_02]: something I always preach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, you can make your own
decisions, but, uh, please never shoot
[SPEAKER_02]: someone that's just still in your plans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grow more next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a peaceful plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's not put violence into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, make your own decisions,
but, uh, here is definitely what will
[SPEAKER_02]: happen when you go to court is the judge
is going to say that you valued a human
[SPEAKER_02]: life more than, or you valued your plant
more than a human life guilty.
[SPEAKER_03]: And depending on where you are,
that plant may be a drug and now it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: drug crime involving a gun.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a big old thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to take it down that road.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's have a good time on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cops and thieves.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, they are out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're looking for your grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cops have helicopters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cops have dogs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cops have fucking friends that are fucking
snitches.
[SPEAKER_03]: That neighbor you think is cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Might not be so cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once he sees you got a big giant pot
plant in the fucking backyard.
[SPEAKER_03]: So be kind of discreet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also that neighbor you think is cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: He knows when harvest day is you're
telling them about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are talking about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're sitting on the fucking back patio
drinking a beer bro in three days.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to cut that fucker down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Suddenly in two days it's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knows you go to the lake every night at
five o'clock with your dogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knows you're going on vacation in two
weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to cut that shit down.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you go to the lake, he's going to dry
it and cure it while you're gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then all winter long, he's going to
sell you your pot back at fucking 50 bucks
[SPEAKER_03]: an eighth.
[SPEAKER_03]: If he does, you're a bitch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how some shit just used to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Old school rules, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Loose lips.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sink ships.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't tell no one that don't absolutely
need to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't show the homies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mentioned on another episode,
you're going to want to post pictures on
[SPEAKER_03]: social media.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just if your friends know where your yard
is, if people know what's up, just wait
[SPEAKER_03]: till it's done.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can take pictures all season and then
you've got, when everybody else is done,
[SPEAKER_03]: you've got pictures to post.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like all winter long you make,
look what I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look what I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Never want to be like, oh, I missed my
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're still posting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So save the pictures until harvest time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of save the pictures until it's
dried.
[SPEAKER_03]: And cured and in a package somewhere,
or you got money in your pocket.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just try to be discreet with the social
media.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're not familiar with the game,
if you're old school and know what you're
[SPEAKER_03]: doing, do your fucking thing player.
[SPEAKER_03]: But some people are really new with this
cannabis became legal in a lot of places.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it felt like the people who just
jumped in when it got legal, some of them
[SPEAKER_03]: forgot that this was some gangster shit at
one point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you gotta, sometimes you had to play
by different rules and you had to live a
[SPEAKER_03]: different way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so people aren't completely prepared
for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, this is a valuable product and there
are shady people out there that will come
[SPEAKER_03]: get your valuable product and they can put
you in harm's way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So keep that in mind when you're doing
this sort of shit, you guys, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: something I want to say on that,
please do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I have always wanted to grow weed on
like a third story balcony that no one can
[SPEAKER_02]: get to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just like totally get to flaunt it
and throw your plan out there for the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole world to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you live in one of those situations,
will you please do that and send Jeff a
[SPEAKER_02]: pic so that we can admire your handiwork?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if you've got a three story building,
uh, in Oklahoma, Colorado, or good fancy
[SPEAKER_03]: parts of Mexico near tacos and a beach,
uh, Jesse's very interested in your three
[SPEAKER_03]: story building.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we need cultivation permits and good
water and fucking a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we don't even need electricity.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just abandoned that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just need water.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, then we're going to grow the shit
out of this building on the third floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, since we're going to do it this way,
we're also going to build a moat.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to moat if we're doing this,
I want to add a moat, uh, crocodiles in
[SPEAKER_03]: the moat for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do crocodiles and sharks get along?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I want to shark in my moat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but we can find all of this out in
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, in Mexico we can do this, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine if I was the shark king,
fuck the tiger king, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get sharks now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guarantee that dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, they're fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next episode, I've only got one arm
and a shark.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my new friend, snappy.
[SPEAKER_03]: This show got fucking weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Jesse's going to light a joint right
as I'm about to ask him a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that you guys may want to be
aware of, uh, while you're selecting your
[SPEAKER_03]: growing spot, something you may want to
think about is a little problem called
[SPEAKER_03]: light pollution.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all, some of us are out in the
fucking country.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of us I'm right in the middle of the
city.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can hear my neighbors when they fart.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can hear the neighbors on that side when
they sneeze.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, they could probably hear us recording
and talking about them right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I've got street lights in the front
and in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got too much light, you may have
flowering issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: What can we do about light pollution,
bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, BB gun, just shoot out them street
lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I said that on one episode and you
reminded me that when I shoot out that
[SPEAKER_03]: light, they're going to come replace the
bulb and then they're going to see my
[SPEAKER_03]: plants in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I used to think light pollution was
a lot worse than it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, although I think your genetics play a
strong role in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I have seen a backyard security light,
uh, that was actually an HID, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was like one of those one
fifties or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I have seen one of those herms that
buck out of like six plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, uh, in the last couple of years,
I've grown some plants outside that are
[SPEAKER_02]: really close to a back porch light and I
haven't had any issues.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so it's going to be up to your
genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, a street light may do it and
led, uh, some led lights are more likely
[SPEAKER_03]: to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like a little back porch light.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with Jesse.
[SPEAKER_03]: The porch lights not going to do much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the thing, a thing happens when the
sun sets, it puts off a certain color
[SPEAKER_03]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going to go too far into that
because I didn't do research.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Proper terms today.
[SPEAKER_03]: As the sun sets, it puts off a far red
spectrum that triggers phytochrome red in
[SPEAKER_03]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that tells the plants it's time to go
sleepy time.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why sometimes the plants will start
to flower when it is still appearing that
[SPEAKER_03]: we are getting more than 12 hours of light
outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is because the red spectrum,
uh, has told those plants it is sleepy
[SPEAKER_03]: time and they just go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when the sun rises, it actually puts
off a blue spectrum that does the exact
[SPEAKER_03]: opposite.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a little alarm clock for the
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: They start waking up.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get functional.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, light, when they set, when that
phytochrome red triggers, I think that
[SPEAKER_03]: most of your outside lights are going to,
uh, they're not even going to matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're hypnotized and those plants are
just sleeping so hard through that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the most part, like if you have
like a flood light and it's like pointing
[SPEAKER_02]: straight at the light, I'd probably move
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it is genetics dependent.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got, don't plant right under the
street light on purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got the option, kind of go in
the darker area, or you may need to think
[SPEAKER_03]: about, and we're going to talk about hoops
here right at the end of this,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll save a couple of minutes for hoop
houses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but you may need to get a hoop house
or some sort of coverage for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't have a good dark area,
if you're out in the country, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: the moon and all that shit, don't worry
about that moonlight.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is good for the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: The moonlight is really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're on the country, you don't have
any problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we're in the city here, so we got a
lot of light.
[SPEAKER_03]: That may be something you want to think
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, before we start working on hoop houses
and stuff, I have a couple of more things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, if you grow from seed,
please make sure you do not let any male
[SPEAKER_03]: plants flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Outdoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is rude as fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is basically as rude as walking up to
Jesse and pissing on his shoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to punch you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we find you with a male flowering
and your male pollinates my outdoor crop,
[SPEAKER_03]: it is customary that I go to your crop and
cut it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is now my crop because you fucked
up mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just how it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally ran a male too long outdoors
last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I live in a kind of isolated area and I
know all my neighbors and I knew for a
[SPEAKER_02]: fact, no one was growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, that is safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I bet I'm going to guess that there
are at least I'm not growing in my
[SPEAKER_03]: backyard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't do outdoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm an indoor soldier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but if I were growing, I would guess
there are at least two other people within
[SPEAKER_03]: a mile radius of me growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know somebody else on this street with a
much different number.
[SPEAKER_03]: His number is way different, but he's on
this exact street.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's growing my genetics in his backyard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I gave him some orange gassum seeds just
recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I were to let a male go,
I would pollinate his shit around here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and I would probably pollinate two or
three other gardens on accident as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys, please be very careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be like Jesse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't fuck up and let those males go
outdoors too long.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're isolated, do your thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're breeding outside, do your thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, I don't like outdoor breeding
because maybe some other guys outdoor
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding down the block and you don't know
what male just threw pollen over both of
[SPEAKER_03]: your plants, but be careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't let the males go too long outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: I highly recommend growing clones outdoors
or feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to go from a regular seed,
please have a good eye on looking for
[SPEAKER_02]: those males.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's this too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've read outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and if that's your thing, it only
takes a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't even take that long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it, the, a male releases pollen long
before you can see it, um, outdoors,
[SPEAKER_02]: cause it's got the wind blowing on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pollen is super fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very light.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's designed to get caught by the wind
and be blown away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it, it really doesn't take very long
to make your seeds outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, and if you get skilled with it,
you can actually nevermind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, another thing on outdoor seeds is,
uh, if they're purposefully made and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're fully ripened, uh, they have
insanely thick husks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and you almost need one of those seed
crackers or like the matchbox.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scuff them up with some sandpaper or
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those outdoor seeds do get a little
rougher.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you can prevent that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, don't let them go as long and that'll
kind of, yeah, just don't let them go as
[SPEAKER_03]: long.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've noticed if I let seeds go too long
indoors, they get too hard and you have
[SPEAKER_03]: worse germ rates.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just get too bulky.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I do the more light, I've got more
potential to let that happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: That window is much shorter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been doing 18 and six toward the end
of flower with my seeded plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, more photons, more seed energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care what the buds look like.
[SPEAKER_03]: They, they revet.
[SPEAKER_03]: They start revetting at the top,
but I don't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grind that shit up and throw it away and
pull the seeds up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let you move stuff to a different room
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can, if you know what that means,
you know what that means.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm vegging and flowering in the same room
and they're not auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, man, we have gone a long way and I've
got two things I want to cover.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's try to cover these really quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, everybody wants to know what they
should put in their soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure that that a lot of people are
going to say, if I'm going to grow in
[SPEAKER_03]: these pots, if I'm going to grow outdoors,
what are a few things I should put in my
[SPEAKER_03]: soil?
[SPEAKER_03]: So can you give me just a quick list of a
few things that would be a good idea to
[SPEAKER_03]: add to my soil mix outside?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh, down to earth makes a product
called, um, bio life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I absolutely love that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just heard about that on another show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it works great for outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: It works great for, um, any plant
outdoors, um, tomatoes, chilies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, if you guys follow my Instagram feed,
you've seen the gardens I've grown the
[SPEAKER_02]: last couple of years and that's been all
bio life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, what you need is some
nitrogen, uh, early.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then late you need high PK,
which normally comes from like iguana or,
[SPEAKER_02]: or maybe a compost or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if you don't have access to bio life,
um, uh, the sub cool super soil recipe
[SPEAKER_02]: works great outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the build a soil recipe works great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Glad you said build a soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, if you're new at
building soils, go to the build a soil
[SPEAKER_03]: website and click around.
[SPEAKER_03]: And before too long, you'll be a soil
expert or you'll think you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll have a really good idea of what you
want to build.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have really good pre-mix starts,
and then they give you really good advice
[SPEAKER_03]: on things to add.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, they've got a base and a bunch of
charge packs.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can add to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, they're, they're really good and
educational resource, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if they still do,
but at one point I purchased a pack from
[SPEAKER_02]: them that was kind of blended for Colorado
soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just added it to native soil with
some peat moss and it worked amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they don't have that, they have
something like Jeff was talking about that
[SPEAKER_02]: is very similar to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Build a soil, uh, tell them I sent you,
they don't pay me at all, but maybe they
[SPEAKER_03]: will one day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Jeremy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, a really good compost goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, make a weekly teas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, just do a basic tea,
uh, molasses, um, worm castings,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, compost, something like that water
aerate, uh, that, that goes a really,
[SPEAKER_02]: really long way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you, do we really need foam on our
compost tea?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, more likely, more likely than not,
uh, if you have foam, uh, your microbes,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're trying to propagate or probably
stuck in that foam.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you want them in solution because when
you water, you're not going to water in
[SPEAKER_03]: the foams so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the biofilm that you get in your tea
is really bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people are always looking for
that foam.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I try to tell them, you don't,
you're not making beer.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're making compost tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I spent a few months at, um, of looking at
compost teas through a microscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because we have evolved.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've learned so much to hear you say,
I used a microscope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a really nice one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big old screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love hooking my little microscope up to
the Mac book and taking video of bugs,
[SPEAKER_03]: eating bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll bring it over sometime.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I just threw myself way off track.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, um, I remember you recommending things
like blood meal, bone meal, fish meal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and there was something else that goes
in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Worm castings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are all great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, bio life has most of that stuff.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, blood mill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that comes from commercial feedlot
shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if you're cool with that, then cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd prefer not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I would prefer not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I, I don't really like eating the beef
from those places.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't eat that at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh, if you can make your own blood
meal, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but that's my, my big thing about
blood mill and bone mill is, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: is where they come from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nasty byproducts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, they're not the best places.
[SPEAKER_02]: The products themselves are okay,
but what's commercially available,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, that's your decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are things that growers think about.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can use that, or you can choose to use
something that's a little more,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, I don't know, friendly, I guess is the
word.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion, there's things that you can
use that are better than blood mill,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, alfalfa mill.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cheaper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's safer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to worry about it getting
in your lungs, uh, as much, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it won't heat up your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't break down as fast like blood
mill does, uh, bone mill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you, you could really stack on some
weight with bone mill late season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it's probably a better replacement
for guanos.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get mined out of caves in South
American countries and then shipped
[SPEAKER_02]: halfway across the world to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, but that's all how you feel
about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've come a long way and you're
thinking you really have back in the day,
[SPEAKER_03]: you told me use buck and bat guano and
bone meal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's yeah, that's kind of the stuff
that you would recommend.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate, no, I appreciate the
growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but bat guanos can be okay if they're,
um, uh, sustainable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh, the seabird guanos are really
fucked up and they're like fucking up
[SPEAKER_02]: nesting grounds and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you know much about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you tell me how that's how that
happens?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, so it gets harvested off of sea
cliffs where seabirds, um, so I'm just
[SPEAKER_03]: going and fucking up their houses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you send like 12 year old up there
with a bucket to, you know, it's a pretty,
[SPEAKER_03]: no mask, no shoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just being hypothetical.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably, yeah, yeah, no,
no, they don't care about them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's, and it really sucks cause
seabird guano makes some very tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I use a couple of products that
I use because it contains seabird guano.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the kelp and seabird guano make
your plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's taste and smell super delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kelp is awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it's time to get a little bit more
mindful on what we're doing to not only to
[SPEAKER_03]: our plants and to the people consuming the
plants, but to the other end of that,
[SPEAKER_03]: what are we doing to the environment?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are we sourcing our feeds,
our nutrients, our minerals, our
[SPEAKER_03]: pesticides, our predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, those are things that I feel now that
I see the evolution in you over the time
[SPEAKER_03]: that we've been hanging out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, now that we're, I hate to say that,
like we're established growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a good fucking, we're black
belts, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it is time.
[SPEAKER_03]: To start thinking more, uh, ethically and,
uh, environmentally conscious and thinking
[SPEAKER_03]: about things like that and start teaching
how to do that sort of stuff is probably
[SPEAKER_03]: one of our next responsibilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, you know, let's, we all know what
it's like to another thing, just to add on
[SPEAKER_02]: top of all of that, uh, is the labor that
the people that are, um, uh, we all know
[SPEAKER_02]: what it's like to be underpaid and
underappreciated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and you can just imagine it's even
worse for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, dude, scraping up bat guano.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds miserable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Surely there's something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, they can just start making cocoa for
us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but then if we have them stop doing
bat guano, do we cut out a job for
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fucked up situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got to shred cocoa now and then when
Americans meddle in, uh, third world
[SPEAKER_02]: politics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's stick to what we know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about hoop houses.
[SPEAKER_03]: A moment ago, we said we should put some
sort of protection out for the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we've got the opportunity, uh,
let's try to spend about seriously two to
[SPEAKER_03]: three minutes just talking about building
a quick, easy hoop house that would
[SPEAKER_03]: protect our plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go to a website called johnny seed.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty sure that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh, just type in Johnny seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sell like flower seeds and farm tools
and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for about four, it comes up
immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll find it for about 40 bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sell a thing called a hoop bender and
you can take a $4 piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's a PVC, uh, con metal conduit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in about 30 seconds, make yourself,
uh, whatever size hoop you need,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, according to whatever size hoop vendor
you bought.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and these hoops will last forever
because it's galvanized, uh, metal,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, unlike the PVC, which typically just
lasts a year or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so that's, I've recently switched
those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I love them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're stronger.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to drive the steak in the
ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, a bunch of people probably feel like I
just get passed a whole bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll back up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're buying, uh, basically arches.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're buying a machine that'll bend some
arches for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to make some golden arches.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got little, little bends and then
align them in a row to where you can
[SPEAKER_03]: basically make a tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So say you planted your three cannabis
plants in a straight row or, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: say you got six and there are two rows of
three.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'd run, uh, one, two, three,
four, uh, four or five of these hoops all
[SPEAKER_02]: the way one down one row.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can cover it with plastic
late in the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get rain or super cold or,
um, or even if dust is a, is a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, just put a tarp over it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to make it dark in there,
you can do that to speed up your season a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, for not a lot of money, what I,
what I have been doing the last couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: years is, is I have tall hoops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and you guys Jesse's six foot
something and he just reached above his
[SPEAKER_03]: head.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he met tall.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like seven feet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like seven and a half feet,
something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I run plastic over the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I've got what they call wiggle wire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you can buy that at Johnny's too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it's attached to the, to the
hoops.
[SPEAKER_02]: It runs about two thirds of the way down,
leaves plenty of airflow down at the
[SPEAKER_02]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, keeps the moisture and ship from,
you know, get on the buds works great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I leave the end open.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's plenty of airflow in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, that sounds real easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you guys, so basically we're just
building arches and putting a row of
[SPEAKER_03]: arches and draping some plastic over it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's where the hail and the rain kind of
bounce off of that plastic instead of
[SPEAKER_03]: destroying our precious plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I'm sure if you're interested in
building a hoop house, it's a really good
[SPEAKER_03]: idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're interested in doing that,
I'm sure you're going to do more research
[SPEAKER_03]: than just listening to this podcast on
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can build you a real nice,
uh, late season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cover for just a couple hundred dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you put a little time in it,
it'll be like some serious ID flex.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's well worth it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll get some almost free cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes a lot of labor and effort,
but other than that, it's almost free
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis and also put some vegetables in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe set up another one and grow some
food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't just grow out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, um, let's go back to the
cops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh, another thing that helps keep them
away, um, and those tiny neighbors away is
[SPEAKER_02]: if you grow a whole bunch of other stuff,
um, and you do it out in the open where
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone can see it, it works very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can promise you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a, we call them the old crazy guy,
but I have a friend shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're listening, Gary, I have an old
friend who had a greenhouse and he would
[SPEAKER_03]: honestly grow nothing but ganja in the
greenhouse and the greenhouse it had walls
[SPEAKER_03]: on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you couldn't see in, but he would go to
the store and buy large amounts of
[SPEAKER_03]: vegetables and just go to the neighbors
and be like, here, we grew a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: extra zucchini.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he was doing a double service.
[SPEAKER_03]: He would go to the farmer's market and
just buy out all of your zucchinis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then go tell somebody else he grew
them and just pass them out to the
[SPEAKER_03]: neighbors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now the neighborhood thinks he just
grew a bunch of zucchini.
[SPEAKER_03]: The farmer sold out and Gary's got cover.
[SPEAKER_03]: It worked beautifully.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ended up with all kinds of vegetables
and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: The neighbors didn't want these.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want them?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gary was a cool guy and he was growing
some good herb in that greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: So beautiful cover, beautiful,
beautiful cover plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, that was when people were really,
really paranoid.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys be paranoid.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's we've gotten a little complacent and
a little silly here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I'm not sure where you are,
but let's not get too carried away.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, there are rules to growing outdoors
in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Follow the rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll talk about the cops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Follow the rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're an adult, do what you want,
but if you follow the rules, you shouldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: get yourself in trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's worth your time to know them and know
them really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, maybe not so much here in Pueblo,
but other parts of the state, I'm sure
[SPEAKER_02]: there are still cops that don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that could be a good thing in a bad
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and if it's turning into a bad thing
and you know, they're wrong, it's very
[SPEAKER_02]: good for you to, uh, cause they make split
second decisions and they're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: fuck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're chopping them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like they come back three days
later and they were totally wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, so if you're within your
legal limits, know them and flex them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Know your rights, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I think that is all of the notes I
wrote down for outdoor culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think that's all of the notes I
wrote down for outdoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just lit up a joint that smells
delicious over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, do you, do you have anything you would
like to add to an outdoor cultivation
[SPEAKER_03]: before we start wrapping up the show?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, grow good genetics, uh, uh,
plants from seed just absolutely kill it
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I think it's, they've got the taproot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if, but for some reason,
uh, seeded plants just murder it outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they do.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just love to go and sunshine is the
most amazing thing for anybody and
[SPEAKER_03]: anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go get some sunshine on your face.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys get outside after the quarantine,
make sure you get all your clones chopped
[SPEAKER_02]: to, um, uh, before the end of July.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, because it will go into flower
and you're going to wish you had those
[SPEAKER_03]: amazing genetics again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have done an episode on revenge just in
case.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Jesse, thanks for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, that smells good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I'm ready for a dab myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we got to get you on the show more
often.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
pimps and hoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, before we do this part, bro,
how can people find you on social media?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, check me out at, uh, uh, Jesse grows
on IG.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse grows on IG.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, if you were watching the space
force episode, those photos of space force
[SPEAKER_03]: I posted were grown by Jesse.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all he's going to say about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's all we need.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse is a discerning grower and he's got
a lot to choose through.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if he says she's a good one,
that, that means a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, not, you know, whatever Jeff
stuff's really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's not just.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually feel like you get slept on a
lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, uh, grow, grow that shit out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: My time is coming, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were sleeping for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, that's I, I'm glad that they slept
because I had to earn my spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like anybody one hit wonders,
come and go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people that, uh, take a while to pop
up, they stick around for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm glad I went slow and steady.
[SPEAKER_03]: That wins the race.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and you're better equipped to handle
the production needs and the success at
[SPEAKER_02]: this point in your life too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had a lot of mentors that showed me
what to and what not to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm glad I took my time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, dude, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me for sure,
