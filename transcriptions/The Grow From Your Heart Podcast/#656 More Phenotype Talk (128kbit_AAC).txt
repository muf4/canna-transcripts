[SPEAKER_00]: While we're doing shout outs and saying
thanks to people, I want to send a big
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you shout out today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I went to the PO box and I got a
great gift in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The PO box is often stuffed with great
gifts, but this one was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something useful, something that we'll get
to put, get put to use on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not had the opportunity to use it
yet, but I promise you I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came with a letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Jeff, big fan of the pod.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grow has benefited a lot since
starting to listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making the grow look better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I thought I would send you a GFYH
grinder as a thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to check out the company on the
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great day from Mike at custom Dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to show you this label before I
show you the grinder they sent me,
[SPEAKER_00]: but big shout out to our friends custom
Dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure to get that on one of
the cameras.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may just have to pop in a logo later,
but make sure you follow our friends
[SPEAKER_00]: custom Dank on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did send me a beautiful gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are great people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is spelled just like you think it would
be custom Dank, or if you're dyslexic Dank
[SPEAKER_00]: custom will work as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not making fun of the dyslexic folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have a touch of this dyslexia myself
if you've never noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the gift that my friends did send
me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an awesome grow from your heart
podcast logo grinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the GF.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take this part off just so I
don't dump it on my computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have the GFYH logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have to take another photo of that
and insert it in later, but there is the
[SPEAKER_00]: GFYH podcast logo beautifully engraved,
embossed, laser etched.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly how, but it is
beautifully done on the top of this
[SPEAKER_00]: grinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: They even got the little gradient part in
the middle of the logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did a hell of a good job on the
artwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's talk about the grinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grinder itself is very well made,
very well constructed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say this is probably
aluminum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that word very oddly, but who
doesn't say aluminum oddly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a nice grinding wheel on the
inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice teeth in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look sharp.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you unscrew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you put your product in here,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a good twist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chop, chop, chop, chop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you'd unscrew here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I kind of liked this part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you unscrew it, you kind of set that
part to the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little dish in here that is
removable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that this little dish comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little screen on the bottom of
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course you'd catch your, uh,
your Keef catch down here in the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little, a little scraper for
your Keef catch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy that beautiful basic
grinder, but it's got the logo on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's well made.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that little cup in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great gift for a candidate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anubis consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do follow my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate good gifts, especially stuff
with the GFYH podcast logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you give them a follow please.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to send more gifts,
send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get you set up with the PO box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll do one of those episodes where
we just open up a bunch of cool shit for
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The music ended and it got quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's focus on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a previous episode, I did a,
uh, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a lesson on phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: I defined the word phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definition was the word I was looking for
that would not come to my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked a lot about phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you what phenotypes were,
how to find phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked a lot about the word phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I got a great followup question from a
podcast listener or viewer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you're watching or viewing
either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the interaction and thank
you for the great feedback and update.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this is a very respectable and
respectful letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let's not, uh, run around in too many
circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get right to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, uh, you were the best and you
give back in so many ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks and respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The respect is mutual here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell, uh, by the way, this is
written that you do disagree with me very
[SPEAKER_00]: respectfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great way to have a
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I do disagree with you
on one topic in episode 655 about
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes, where you said that you're
backing off on your phenotype discussions
[SPEAKER_00]: in your strain descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I disagree that you should do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I did say that I feel like I'm
messing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: By giving you, uh, too much guidance and
too much help on selecting phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that is some work that you
should do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is custom work that should be
tailored for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why there are phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why there are selection to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's part of the beauty of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was going to leave that up to you a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've offered a quality
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not give you some variation to choose
from, find what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said all of this on the previous
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me keep going with this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I had a skunk number one sweet
skunk plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I wanted to improve upon,
which is a great use for some of my
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to breed something and make it
a little better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, some of my stuff is definitely a good
way to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I researched regular male seeds
and I decided on a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good breeding plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says my goals were to bring up my THC
and increase bud density while retaining
[SPEAKER_00]: my skunk's bud formation, excuse me,
the skunk's bud formation, classic red,
[SPEAKER_00]: orange, light green, and so many swelled
bracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over seeded traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a trait of this plant is red,
orange, and light green with swelled
[SPEAKER_00]: bracts that look like they are over
seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks like it's got some swollen
bracts on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's just a trait of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not seeded, but it looks like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a trait that is an observable
characteristic of this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he wanted to keep that trait along with
the bud formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they wanted to add some density and a
little bit of potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they, uh, selected chose a rise as the
breeding male, which is a very good
[SPEAKER_00]: choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they knew that because of the things
that I typed on my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes on to say, I got 10 arise
seeds from seeds here now.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I acquired four males.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hoping for a 50, 50 pheno,
but no, what I had to choose from was one
[SPEAKER_00]: golden goat, one stretcher, one
daybreaker, and one question mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this how you ask because of your
great arise pheno descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I hadn't described that arise plant
and those phenos to expect very well,
[SPEAKER_00]: so well, this listener, this breeder,
this grower would not have known that
[SPEAKER_00]: arise would be the perfect candidate for
breeding to make his project what he
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted it to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reliable description that I gave
that gave the in-depth, the detailed
[SPEAKER_00]: description that I gave about phenotypes,
that really helped our grower friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: our breeder friend, our listener,
maybe a viewer friend to make the proper
[SPEAKER_00]: selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe just maybe I do need to keep
giving those detailed descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says monkey puke.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really great name, not something
I would have used something I do love.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it when you nail it and get the
name right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you didn't take something I would have
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not, uh, not on my brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to stay on brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's off brand for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very on brand for you probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's beautiful monkey puke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if I saw a jar of monkey puke on the
shelf, I would want to smell that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does monkey puke smell like?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what my brain, I would just go,
what does, and I would know it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not real monkey puke.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was not a primate involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no vomiting to be done,
but I think that's what monkey puke is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to smell like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I smell the jar, that's what you've
done to my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think I'm smelling monkey puke,
weird psychological tricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We play on people with strained names
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me continue here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monkey puke F one, which is skunk one to
arise is in day 45.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I got exactly what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love so many things about this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the respectful argument, uh,
the respectful disagreement may be my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the, you've mentioned so many details
about your breeding, your goal,
[SPEAKER_00]: your idea, the reason you were doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is so awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks like you are hitting your
goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're 45 days in and it appears like you
were getting what you wanted and expected
[SPEAKER_00]: out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, from one breeder to another,
that is really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up much respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that is super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited for your brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, just from one bro, one breeder to
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what it's like when it's like 45
days in and you're going, Oh, I think I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might've got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like when the chef starts smelling
the ingredients and everybody,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, in the kitchen, it smells good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people in the living room start
peeking their head into going,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro, what are you doing in here?
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells fucking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not a grower, if you're not a
breeder, you don't understand the feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the feeling when somebody peeps
their head in the kitchen and goes,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude, whatever you're cooking,
I can't wait for it to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we are with this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited for you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't tell, um, it says,
uh, only time and possibly an F two
[SPEAKER_00]: generation will tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that you're even ready already,
already ready to take it to F two.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't even finished the F one batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy's excited and eager.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the types of breeders we need in
this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, the point remains that I would
have no idea what I was looking for in a
[SPEAKER_00]: mail without your arise strain
description.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're selecting a mail podcast with
99% of the other breeders work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have zero zip, nothing to go by.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a 1% or my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't change what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add more strain description.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to interrupt myself here and I'm
going to say my website needs some
[SPEAKER_00]: attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I've got strain descriptions and
photos for most of my stuff up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the website, you notice
there's not a photo, there's not a strain
[SPEAKER_00]: description for something that you've got
experience with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a message, include that photo,
include that strain description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you've just got some details about
a strain that you think should be on the
[SPEAKER_00]: website, uh, this one gets super fat at
the end of week nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you let this one go to week 10,
it gets super stinky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you notice, send me some details
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will send you a thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will give you a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we'll make it worth it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got some great photos,
please send me those photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, maybe I just need to update the
website with your photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe your photos are better than what's
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to get the website updated
for the start of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get right back into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so keep adding the strain
descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add more descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we were in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yes, I want to add more descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to add more pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk more about phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it is summertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just realized I've got an awesome summer
project I wasn't prepared for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I will do more stuff on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just asked for help for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I grow these strains, I do learn
more things about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to develop the relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't see that something,
uh, is factual, I don't put it on the
[SPEAKER_00]: website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't just ramble off some shit,
uh, like say that it's bright green and
[SPEAKER_00]: smells like a skunk's ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes you feel like you just came
when you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I could put that on the website about
everything, but there's no need to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to call me back and
say, I still don't feel like I came after
[SPEAKER_00]: you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one's going to want to buy that
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I have to grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to get the experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to develop the relationship to be
able to talk about it, uh, in that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: a deep detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be patient with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many limitations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I was running a lot of not running,
working with and operating in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial facilities since COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've really dialed that back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm on my own personal space and
numbers, which really, really limits a
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a lot of test growers out
there helping me out and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're learning a lot, but not as rapidly
as we could when we had the commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: environments at our fingertips.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, I got the most beautiful and
lemony plant ever in the tent with monkey
[SPEAKER_00]: puke.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's an awesome lemon sunrise.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a beautiful and lemony plant
ever in the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's an awesome lemon sunrise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend, you are breeding with my
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are growing my genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm honored that you trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You trust my breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You trust my selections, and then thank
you for the respectful argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have convinced me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will continue to do in depth phenotype
explanations.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want to do is help you guys
identify the phenos and know what to
[SPEAKER_00]: expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I don't want you to do is,
uh, make you search too hard for the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes that I have talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you passing up awesome
phenotypes that would work very well for
[SPEAKER_00]: you because you heard me talk about a
different phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the one that is going to work
beautifully for you and work with that
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, I don't want to mess you up is
really what I'm trying to avoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will help you identify phenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're like, Hey, does this look more
like the mean girl?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this look more like the stretchy
girl?
[SPEAKER_00]: I will tell you that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also keep in mind these phenotypes,
I'm giving you ideas and suggestions of
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of guidelines of what box it may fall
into.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be more of the mean girl
phenotype and the nice girl and the chunky
[SPEAKER_00]: girl phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have, I could see all of that in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just doesn't have to be labeled one
of those phenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying those are the common
phenotypes that I have identified and
[SPEAKER_00]: traits that I have observed over time from
working with these plants so many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will continue to give in depth
descriptions of new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will update the old stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I will continue to give you phenotype
ideas of what to expect out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will continue to help you identify
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you send me a picture and you say,
uh, does this look more goat leaning or
[SPEAKER_00]: more arriving?
[SPEAKER_00]: I will try to help you with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, don't get offended if I don't respond
right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got, um, I'm going to say about
18,000 unread emails right now and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing personal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just one of me and there must be
at least 18,000 of you with the question
[SPEAKER_00]: and I cannot keep up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have an intern.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a secretary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do the grow for the first half of the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do the podcast or internet work for the
second half of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the third half of the day is when I
do all the normal life stuff that most
[SPEAKER_00]: people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, there are three halves to my
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my days are different than yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I guess being a small business owner
or a business owner, a proprietor,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, an entrepreneur, I guess being
overloaded is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I catch up, that means I fucked up to
tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, I apologize that I'm behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'm very grateful that I'm behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a double edged sword.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I used to let it super stress me
that my social media inboxes were
[SPEAKER_00]: overflowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email inboxes were overflowed at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have accepted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just something that is going to be,
I want to reply to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to answer your messages,
but I want to do a lot of shit also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to take a nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, don't take it personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm not answering your message,
send me, send me your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, send me the phenotype questions is
what I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know which phenotype you need me to
identify.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do my best, but don't expect it to
fall exactly in one of the boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be the 50 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's the 30 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm going to say it looks kind of
golden goat, but also has the bud shape
[SPEAKER_00]: and the leaf structure of the platinum
tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might get different shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is possible with genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for the great feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from our friend who calls
themselves S C dung slinger 79.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm guessing that's some organics with
the dung slinger and 79 is probably the
[SPEAKER_00]: year you were born and SC is probably
South Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just guessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am assuming making an appearance of
myself, but big shout out to our buddy SC
[SPEAKER_00]: dung slinger 79, uh, hashtag pollen
chucked genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I do appreciate the, the respectful
arguments are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the criticism, the feedback I invite
request and accept that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions, corrections,
comments, or concerns, or feedback,
[SPEAKER_00]: I do love to hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email address is grow from your heart
at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me some messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next message that I've got unfolded
here on the table that I'm trying to pull
[SPEAKER_00]: out from underneath the computer comes
from our friend Pete.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is a quick one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says, should I hang a battery
powered lantern in the flower and veg
[SPEAKER_00]: tents?
[SPEAKER_00]: If my power will be turned power will be
turned off for eight hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: The electrical company is replacing an
electric pole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, no, I think that eight hours of off
time will be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can interrupt the daylight cycle and
give them this eight hours of off time and
[SPEAKER_00]: they will be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you cannot do is interrupt the dark
cycle and expect them to be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying not to burp into the microphone
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm better.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I wanted to say was you can interrupt
the daytime cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants get extra dark, it is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to think it was a shady day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was cloudy or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just weren't getting as much sun as
they should have.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be like, Oh, it's nice
and cloudy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dreary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they're going to have Netflix and
chill that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just going to chill out,
take a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get the photosynthesis
and metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get the growth that
day that you normally would have,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's 18 hours, uh, 24 hours of light
that you're not going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that big of a deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually just, you're interrupting
eight hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can interrupt the daytime with
unexpected darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't do that all the time,
but this one time, this one day when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing construction, this will not
be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the other part of this that I want to
make sure to say is you cannot interrupt
[SPEAKER_00]: the dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: When those plants are in a flowering phase
and you've got them in the dark for 18 or
[SPEAKER_00]: for 12 hours, do not interrupt that 12
hours of darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is more critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will cause you problems that could
lead to issues down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do not think you need to hang a
battery powered lantern in the flower or
[SPEAKER_00]: veg tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're only going to be off for this
one day for eight hours, that shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_00]: too big of a deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may notice that the tents get a little
bit humid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to figure out open some
doors, open some windows, get that humid
[SPEAKER_00]: smell out or humid out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you're going to get that stanky
ass smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to stink because your carbon
filters are not running.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have some things to think
about right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's only going to be eight hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing is don't panic and do
anything stupid to make it worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may just want to leave while the power
is out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go somewhere else and say the plants
got to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants will be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight hours will not destroy your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should not cause too many big problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing when you get back home,
reseed everything, reset all of your
[SPEAKER_00]: timers, your fans, your air conditioners,
just go check on everything and make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that the timers are correct and get them
back on their regularly scheduled program
[SPEAKER_00]: as soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go make sure that your, uh,
your veg tent timer, your light timer is
[SPEAKER_00]: on, go make sure that your flower room
timer, your flower tent timer is on and
[SPEAKER_00]: set to the time you think it should be and
the off and on time that you think it
[SPEAKER_00]: should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go do a little bit of a check,
cover your own ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got an air conditioner,
that's on a timer or has some settings,
[SPEAKER_00]: check those settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go make sure all your fans and blowers are
reset the way that they should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then walk around the house, fix the clock
on the microwave, the clock on anything
[SPEAKER_00]: that went off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of our stuff's digital and resets
itself now, but go fix all the clocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go make sure that they're all synced up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that shit corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think you need to hang up a
battery powered lantern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the plants will be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just going to think it was a shady
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you guys, you can have darkness
during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light cycle that shouldn't cause you
too big of a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is not major for too long,
if you're doing it for more than 24 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: or so, it may start to, uh, tell your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good idea to go into flower,
but eight to 12 to 14, 20 hours shouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: be a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you cannot do is have light during
the dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not think about it just like this
during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you take a nap?
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be totally fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it nice and dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lay down, get some sneak,
some snoozes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say some snores and some
snoozes.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time going to leave that shit
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the kind of day it has been.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, make it dark for a few minutes,
get nice and stone and pass out for like
[SPEAKER_00]: an hour and wake up and feel refreshed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if I wake you up for an hour in the
middle of the night and expect you to do
[SPEAKER_00]: shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be mad at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could take a nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to get woken up
unexpectedly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how the plants operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend, Pete, I want to thank you for a
great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got me rambling for quite a bit on
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, my camera flickered at me and
did some weird shit and I really don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to miss any of this recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm going to do, I'm going to wrap
up this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may be a short episode, but I don't
want to lose this recording because I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know what's happening with that
camera.
