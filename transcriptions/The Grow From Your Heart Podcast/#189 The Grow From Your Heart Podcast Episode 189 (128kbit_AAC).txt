[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 189 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Ross DeGioffo,
and I thank you guys again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to Kat, Ku, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everybody's smoking on something
delicious with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're rolling up a fat joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you got a blunt twisted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're smoking some shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, tonight, I am smoking some
Apothecary Extracts Lemon Jeffrey Live
[SPEAKER_00]: Batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked this up at a dispensary in
Colorado Springs called Elevations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today was my first time there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an amazing visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody was super kind to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some familiar faces and some new friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elevations in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fair pricing, good products, and a super
friendly staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody let them know I said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know they got a huge compliment,
please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to everybody there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's treated very well by everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: People I knew and people I just met all
treated me like a rock star.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Apothecary Extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ran this Lemon Jeffrey Live Batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff was delicious, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around four o'clock this afternoon,
and this gram that I'm holding in my hand,
[SPEAKER_00]: this package is completely empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how delicious this hash was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kept taking dabs because it tastes
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes just like the Lemon Jeffrey
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had Lemon Jeffrey flowers on the
shelf, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowers were beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were perfectly trimmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were nice and frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were bright green, just like Lemon
Jeffrey should be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends at Elevations
in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, huge shout out to Apothecary
Extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great work, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody did great work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grow had to be amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the material was amazing,
and this hash is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time this episode comes out,
I assure you this product will be sold out
[SPEAKER_00]: over at Elevations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've always got amazing products on the
shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also check out wherever you can find a
drop of Apothecary Extracts Live Resin,
[SPEAKER_00]: Live Butter, Live Batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice work, Woody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good work, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also shout out to Brandon for taking good
care of me today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me explain something here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said batter, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said live batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are probably going, what's he
smoking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Live batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was live resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to keep backing up steps because the
more stuff I say, the more stuff I realize
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these plants, the plants that made this
material were cut down, and the big leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: were taken off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything with trichomes were left on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those buds were frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That frozen bud was delivered to an
extraction company.
[SPEAKER_00]: That extraction company ran it while it
was still frozen through a closed-loop
[SPEAKER_00]: butane system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says here, solvents butane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was ran with n-butane is what it
was made with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it ran it through probably an Emotec
machine or something similar, an OB Dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ran it through there with n-butane
while it was frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it came out very, all of the terpenes
were still intact.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came out very terpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the terps were still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the flavor was still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are they calling it live resin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Live resin is when the plants are cut down
and frozen and we run them frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what live resin is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are they calling it live batter is
what I should get to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like cake batter, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the consistency of cake batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not quite as runny as cake batter,
but it's thick and battery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a really interesting and unique
consistency to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A long time ago, we might not have
approved of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A long time ago, we might have said this
looked bad, but the new tech makes it look
[SPEAKER_00]: delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just kissed their ass for a good
solid minute and a half, but I completely
[SPEAKER_00]: approve of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bred the lemon, Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I saw that Apothecary had ran it
and turned it into batter, I had to go get
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody did a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a great job of smoking this gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I picked up several.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I've been putting
out old episodes of the podcast in chunks
[SPEAKER_00]: of three.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some OCD.
[SPEAKER_00]: My OCD comes in groups of three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting podcasts in groups of
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, they're about an hour long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that three hour chunk is kind of what
my recording software and where I post my
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast, they don't really handle longer
than a three hour episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting three hour chunks of
three episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're enjoying those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put them out every Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't caught on, go listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Episodes one through nine are available
now in three different chunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been doing a new episode on
Monday, an old episode on Thursday,
[SPEAKER_00]: new episode on Monday, old episode on
Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to do that as long as my
schedule will allow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I announced on a few episodes back,
I am now the lead cultivator for Three
[SPEAKER_00]: Rivers Organics in Pueblo West.
[SPEAKER_00]: That keeps me completely busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got my own garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a father.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a social life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I need to eat and sleep and
take care of myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to take care of my health.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to take care of my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do stay busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will try to get all of the episodes out
to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have promised you YouTube videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am working on the YouTube videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of work to make a damn
YouTube video with iMovie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting them done.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put those up in chunks
because like I said, you people are
[SPEAKER_00]: savages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I put out new content,
you consume it immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you beg for more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to have more for you lined up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to put out stuff and then not
have anything ready for the people that
[SPEAKER_00]: are savages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be patient with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will get that stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next on the agenda, I want to talk about
t-shirts and hoodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have a few Grow From Your Heart
podcast hoodies available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only got bigger sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got large, extra large, and possibly
extra, extra large, and maybe even triple
[SPEAKER_00]: X.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on when you email me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in one of those,
send me an email,
[SPEAKER_00]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to put a hoodie on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shipping on them is kind of expensive
because I ship them in one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: priority mailboxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a little bit pricey, but it's well
worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will get you one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also coming very soon, ladies and
gentlemen, Grow From Your Heart podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hoodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me describe the hoodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hoodies have the Grow From Your Heart
podcast logo on the left breast,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it is smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not have my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just has the EQ bar, and it says Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back, however, it's got the logo
quite large with my cheesy face on there,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like the logo you see on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is on the hoodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the t-shirts, it says Grow From Your
Heart on the front without my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the logo that does not have my
face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like wearing a shirt with my face
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be able to wear a Grow From Your
Heart podcast t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the front, it's got the logo,
does not have my face, nice and bright.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the EQ bars that are red,
gold, and green so I can keep the Rasta
[SPEAKER_00]: colors in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the Grow From Your Heart podcast logo
is Rasta colored.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's red, yellow, and green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on the back, you guys, on the back,
centered on the back across the shoulders,
[SPEAKER_00]: it says take a fat dab and give your mom a
hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those t-shirts will be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time this episode comes out,
hopefully those t-shirts will arrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to our friends at Handmade
Apparel for making me more t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in a t-shirt or a
hoodie, please send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friend, Kelvin Medina.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I told him I had t-shirts
available, he placed an order for two for
[SPEAKER_00]: himself and one for his son.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love, much respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, t-shirts are coming,
hoodies are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want one, email me,
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next on my agenda, before we get to the
main topic, let me tease the main topic
[SPEAKER_00]: before I keep boring you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get your attention to make sure you
keep listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you're supposed to do it,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be episode number three
of the Common Garden Pests and Issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part three, this episode we're going to
talk about thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're gonna talk about is the
garden issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thrips come, seems like if you buy soil,
you get thrips for free in most soil these
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna talk about how to take care
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let me keep moving on with the
pre-show stuff that I like to cover and
[SPEAKER_00]: then we will get into the handling thrips
talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon, that's right, Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about Patreon quite often.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ignored Patreon for a couple episodes so
that people didn't get sick of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you what Patreon is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon is a service that allows you as a
listener to contribute to the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: financially.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like this podcast was worth a
dollar of your time, you can go to patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: .com slash growfromyourheart and you can
sign up to contribute to the Grow From
[SPEAKER_00]: Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to get rich off podcasting,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I podcast because I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I podcast because I can't shut up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I podcast because I love cannabis and I
can't shut up about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was sitting at the table with Maddie and
Spence and a bunch of the crew a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: ago and people would ask me questions
about growing and I caught myself
[SPEAKER_00]: repeating myself saying the same shit over
and over to people and I thought I should
[SPEAKER_00]: just record this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when somebody asked me this question,
I can tell them, hey, go listen to number
[SPEAKER_00]: 74 of my podcast and you can learn this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just love talking about cannabis and
I love podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love communicating with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want everyone to grow good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I do the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I'm asking for financial
support is because it does cost me money,
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The equipment costs money to upkeep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always having an equipment failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something always fucking breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technology always breaks down on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, my website, iregeneticscolorado.com,
is where I host the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does cost a little bit of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I'm putting up one episode on Monday
and another three hour episode on
[SPEAKER_00]: Thursday, I'm using up a lot of bandwidth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm paying for a large service package.
[SPEAKER_00]: It costs me a little bit of money to keep
that website up every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just asking for help to offset the
cost of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will pay for it out of my pocket if I
need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of my favorite things to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you guys would like to help,
I would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not begging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying, hey, I could use a hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing you a favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be cool if you did me a favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can't help me out, I still love
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you just for listening to the
podcast and being there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you for supporting cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you for wanting to know more about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't feel like you need to give me
something for me to like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like you just for being there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some folks can contribute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some folks contacted me and they're like,
hey, man, you helped me out a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can I do for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks like that, Patreon is there for them
if you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not begging.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I want to move on to reading a
couple of iTunes comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't read iTunes comments in a couple
of episodes and I've got two great new
[SPEAKER_00]: comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a big deep breath and
slow down because I feel like I'm talking
[SPEAKER_00]: really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you just got to calm the fuck
down and get zen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to edit that moment
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this first comment that I want to read
comes from a person who calls themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: Will Grow Freely.
[SPEAKER_00]: They left the comment on February 27th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their comment was titled Touch of Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, they gave me five stars and it
goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an awesome show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to new episodes coming out
every Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff puts a lot of time and energy into
making every episode and it shows as
[SPEAKER_00]: someone from a prohibition state.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to hear about growing and
cannabis culture so that I can keep tabs
[SPEAKER_00]: on what's happening in the free world.
[SPEAKER_00]: White Mike rules as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hear that, Mike?
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got a shout out, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: White Mike rules as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best cannabis podcast out there by far.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will grow freely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several people have told me I'm the best
cannabis podcast out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not in any competition but I
completely appreciate hearing that because
[SPEAKER_00]: some of my heroes have podcasts about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing that my heroes, you're telling
me that you like me more than the people
[SPEAKER_00]: that have inspired me, that means a lot to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I don't find competition in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Support all the cannabis podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll learn something different from
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I listen to their podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to listen to too much of the
other podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can listen to Bo Nellis because she
doesn't contaminate my thought process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I listen to The Dude Grows and The
Adam Dunn Show too much, I feel like they
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of contaminate my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I end up doing their show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like if a musician, if I'm a drummer,
I feel like if I listen to Led Zeppelin
[SPEAKER_00]: all day and then I play my drums,
I sound like Led Zeppelin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't listen to The Dude Grows too
frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course I listen to The Dude Grows Show
but I can't listen religiously because I
[SPEAKER_00]: start talking like Scotty and I start
talking like the dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't listen to too many of the
cannabis podcasts but I do listen to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I listen to The Adam Dunn Podcast,
I get too sucked into the topic that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're talking about and I want to
research it and then I want to do it on my
[SPEAKER_00]: show and I feel like I'm just ripping them
off and that's not fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just can't because I feel like if I
listen to the same comedians all the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: I start telling their jokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to do that to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep it mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: How the hell did I get way out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I was talking about being the best
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I listen to them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want the competition, but thank
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go freely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the five-star comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that you are appreciating the
culture part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like you're here with me is what
I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to know that we're dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to know what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to know about the events we're
going to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to know about the equipment
we're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm trying to do is keep you in
the loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for noticing and super thanks
for the comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next comment comes from somebody who
calls themselves KCCB68.
[SPEAKER_00]: The title of their comment was Sets the
Standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They left the comment on February 27th and
of course they gave me another five-star
[SPEAKER_00]: rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: The comment is short and simple and it
goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff has an elite knowledge of cannabis
horticulture and doesn't push brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that you noticed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was another podcast that kind of
inspired me to do a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time somebody would say,
hey, I've got a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would say, go buy this product and
spread it all over your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Problem solved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like that was not a real
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a band-aid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray fluoromite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have spider mites anymore for
about 45 days, but in 45 days you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get spider mites again because you did
not correct the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't push brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I push solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I push logic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I push passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for noticing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: An elite knowledge of cannabis
horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I use that in my resume?
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds fucking good, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: KCCB68.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's open.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be open gender.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate that comment, dude,
and or do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be both nowadays, I guess,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I didn't just embarrass you saying
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awkward.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, thank you for the great
comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to use that in my resume.
[SPEAKER_00]: An elite knowledge of cannabis
horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do not push brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been approached by brands that want
me to advertise on the show and I try not
[SPEAKER_00]: to do it because I don't want it to affect
my advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, thank you for the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody wants to leave an iTunes
comment, I would truly appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you have to do is go to iTunes,
go to the iTunes store, search for the
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow From Your Heart podcast, scroll down
to the bottom, click on the Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_00]: Heart podcast logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's a little section.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says ratings and reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find where to write a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll also find where to put in some
stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, everybody has given me a five star
rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to click on the amount of
stars you feel I truly deserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will also read your comment on a
future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you guys can hear the dryness in
my voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to press pause for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take quick drink and I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will get to the point of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a couple more dabs and I took a
couple of drinks and I am ready to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about our next garden issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about thrips and how to
identify, eradicate, and prevent getting
[SPEAKER_00]: thrips in your cannabis garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about thrips
before we talk about getting rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thrips are ugly motherfuckers,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thrips are barely visible to the naked
eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're super tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a microscope to see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a magnifying glass to see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will probably never see them,
but you will see the damage that they
[SPEAKER_00]: leave in.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your garden, you'll see their honeydew.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see their poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see their effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about the adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adults have wings, but they don't fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of bullshit bug is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got wings that doesn't fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see a bug with wings that
doesn't fly in your magnifying glass,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is probably possibly a thrip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they jump.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read that thrips jump.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen this personally because
they are so small.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thrips have yellow or brown heads and
bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are yellowish brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look, they're just ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's ugly little nasty little bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They attack the leaves and they're often
found on the surface of your leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, you guys, the number one way
that I think I have gotten thrips is by
[SPEAKER_00]: purchasing soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't blame any specific brand of soil
because it's happened with more than one
[SPEAKER_00]: brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens with soil is it's made by a
certain vendor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're buying soil brand A, soil brand B.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're made by a vendor and a certain
warehouse in a certain location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one's made in Colorado, one's made
in Michigan, one's made in California,
[SPEAKER_00]: but eventually they all end up in a
shipping warehouse together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all get stacked together.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those packages had bugs and just
like any other community, the bugs spread
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout all the dirt and now those
packs of dirt get put on a pallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get shipped to your local Hydro's
shop and you buy them and now you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: free thrips with your dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a good idea to treat for thrips
right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to, when I transplant, I like to
soak root drench all of my new transplants
[SPEAKER_00]: with evergreen pyrethrum spray or a
pyrethrum drench.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use 15 milliliters per gallon of
evergreen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's evergreen pyganic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix that in with your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put it in with your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pH it and then just soak your
plants with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soak the water, soak the soil is what I'm
trying to say and that will get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: most of your soil bound pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would almost recommend doing that again
in about five days and that'll,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they laid eggs in there, that will kill
their eggs also.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will really help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're gonna go organics, use some neem
cakes, some caranja meal, some neem meal
[SPEAKER_00]: in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will really help get rid of them in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like a lot of the thrips,
you buy them free with your dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like a bonus.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like a prize in your cereal.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of bugs come that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a good idea to treat before you
even see problems with thrips in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, especially now in the springtime and
in the summertime when it gets warmer,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will get a lot more bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's cold, they die off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're being hauled across the country in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in the back of a Hydro's shop in
the cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna get cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not gonna live through that,
but the eggs may, so you need to treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so you will find them attacking
the leaves and the leaf surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get up there and they chew on the
leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: They penetrate the leaf surface and they
suck out the sap and juices.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, that's what most of these plant
insects do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get in there and suck out the life
juice from your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They dehydrate your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They suck out all the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They suck out all the nourishment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This slows down the growth of most of your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This slows down the vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will certainly slow down and decrease
the yield of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will mess with the amount of resin in
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will mess with the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it mess with flavor?
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants will trigger different
terpenoids and different cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're under a stress response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things will be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see problems that you didn't see
before because they're dealing with
[SPEAKER_00]: stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thrips will leave like a white silver
mark or patches on your leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call this honeydew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's their shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're biting into your leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sucking out the juice and then
they're leaving these little snail trails,
[SPEAKER_00]: this little glistening glittery.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call it a honeydew trail.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's their shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's their secretion.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pooping all over your plants and I
find it to be completely disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want thrips in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll make your leaves look kind of
scabbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll make it look like your leaves just
got beat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll make everything ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like something's been in there
chewing on the garden because it has.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you will see green or black
specks on the bottom sides of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite often near the veins of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the main vein that runs down the
center of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you got the little veins that branch
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will find specks of green chunk or
brown chunk or black chunks underneath
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what that is you guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is thrips shit on your leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna make hash out of that and
you're gonna smoke thrips shit and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of the thrips you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's several ways to get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna talk about that here in just a
couple of seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wants to smoke thrips or thrips
shit or thrips honeydew.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get rid of these bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the damage looks a lot like
spider mites but it gets a lot worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thrips can do a lot more damage than a
spider mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Russet mites are probably more dangerous
than thrips but thrips can really destroy
[SPEAKER_00]: things quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thrips can kill gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Commercial gardens have been shut down and
started over because of thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see thrips, if you suspect
thrips, you need to get in there and you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to take care of it very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you prevent thrips?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like most of the other issues I've
talked about, you can prevent thrips by
[SPEAKER_00]: having a clean sealed environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a clean grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not let your pets into the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you bring in new plants from another
grower, if you bring in plants from a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary, treat those plants before they
are introduced to your main grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a quarantine area.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I give you a clone, do not trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a good grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am reputable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know where I got clones from.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know who I've been cloning with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know whose garden I've played
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know whose dispensary grow I've
been to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know what grow store I went to
and who I brushed up against.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I give you a clone, act like it's got
bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Act like it has powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat it accordingly and don't introduce
it to general population until you are
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that it is bug free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't bring clones in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't bring plants in without treating
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't bring your pets into the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about how your pets carry
bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't bring them in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you buy new soil, when you put plants
into it, treat it right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those plants are vigorous enough,
treat it with the evergreen piganics and
[SPEAKER_00]: that will help you get rid of soil bound
pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, don't travel from garden to garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in another garden, take a
shower, change your clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't drag the pests around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Change your shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't wear the same shoes from one garden
to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were recycling soil, if you've got
soil in a compost area or if you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: soil outside or if you've got soil in your
garage, treat that soil as if it are
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminated with bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get rid of the bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you don't bring the thrips in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: A prevention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way to prevent thrips are the
yellow and blue sticky cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the yellow ones up kind of higher and
the blue ones a little bit lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will certainly help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are mostly going to let you know
that thrips are there and that you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: treat harder or start stepping up your
pesticide or your beneficial insect
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your IPM program needs to be stepped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So use the cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will let you know if you've got
insects showing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not going to catch the large
amount of the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to catch the few that fly to
the cards that travel to the cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see those, that lets you know
there are a lot more there that you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cards are a great start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you can do if you see the
bugs or you can do it as a preventative,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can use diatomaceous earth on the top
of your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This only works, of course, if you were
using soil plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing in hydro, this is not an
option for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using soil or cocoa or soil-less
mix, take the top of the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that Sean taught us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Sean.
[SPEAKER_00]: King Cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also shout out to Kelly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw Kelly the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have time to stop and say what's
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: She saw me.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was working.
[SPEAKER_00]: She didn't have time to stop and say
what's up, but we waved.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Kelly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Kayla Kelly and King Cola,
Ross Cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you guys are doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it organic, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So diatomaceous earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the soil dries, sprinkle a layer,
like just a thin layer of diatomaceous
[SPEAKER_00]: earth across the entire top of the soil
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to cover it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now diatomaceous earth is really coarse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of sharp.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a soft bodied insect,
you don't want to climb through that shit
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's going to claw you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like trying to watch a human climb
through a bunch of lava rocks while naked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just going to get cut to shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be any fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bugs don't want to climb through
the diatomaceous earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thrips don't want to climb down in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to go into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to climb out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diatomaceous earth is very effective on a
lot of insects that travel through your
[SPEAKER_00]: soil that want to go from the leaves to
the soil that try to make like a little
[SPEAKER_00]: like a little area, like a what is a trade
route is what I want to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diatomaceous earth is great for those
types of bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let the soil dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sprinkle it on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once your plants need water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you can water them, but it's most
effective to put it on there while the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to let it go for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great way to get rid of thrips are
beneficial nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about beneficial nematodes a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I recommend a place called
Arbeco Organics to get your beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want their website, it is Arbeco.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not sponsor me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not pitch them because they pay me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I advertise for them because they send me
a very helpful magazine in the mail every
[SPEAKER_00]: three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it tells me which insects I should be
using right now for the weather,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I trust them and I appreciate this
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're very affordable and reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I want to mention, I mentioned
some beneficial and beneficial insects for
[SPEAKER_00]: other problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should tell you to pay attention to
which predators you're purchasing because
[SPEAKER_00]: if you don't have the right environment
for them, they will either die or leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will just scamper off and go
somewhere where the environment's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you were looking for perhaps an
aphid predator, aphid predators,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ones on this page that I just happened
to see, it says here they prefer 64 to 77
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees with a moderate to 70% humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have that environment,
you may need a different beneficial insect
[SPEAKER_00]: because those guys aren't gonna wanna hang
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna take off and go where it's
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you've got food there,
they don't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got all of the good food,
if you've got all the pizza and Dr. Pepper
[SPEAKER_00]: on the planet, but it's 102 degrees,
I still don't care about that pizza and
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna get the fuck out and go where
it's about 75 degrees and I'll find some
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Pepper and pizza there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may need the right environment for
your beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that you can do if you see
these thrips coming, neem oil helps get
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of the thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I've talked about before,
neem oil will make your concentrates taste
[SPEAKER_00]: like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other day I smoked some concentrate
from a dispensary and I could taste the
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not a pesticide, it was an
essential oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hit it and I went, ooh, peppermint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't say anything out loud,
but I passed it to somebody else and they
[SPEAKER_00]: took a dab and I go, what do you think of
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, it tastes like fucking
peppermint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, all right, it's not in my
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can taste the essential oils on
plants, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only use neem and veg if you're going to
use it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you can use to get rid of
the thrips is spinosad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spinosad is a fungus that happens at the
bottom of whiskey barrels.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an off product of fermentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can spray it onto the plants and it
will destroy most of the insects that are
[SPEAKER_00]: on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll take down white flies and it'll
certainly take down thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I called them flips in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I like is evergreen
pyrethrum or evergreen pyganic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works as a spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can spray your plants with it and you
can drench the soil with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if you do the combo,
if you put up some yellow and blue sticky
[SPEAKER_00]: traps, you spray the plants with evergreen
and you root drench with evergreen,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything except the plant will die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is organic and it is not too
harmful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do it early in veg and one time
before flower, you should not have a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem with funky shit on your buds when
it comes time to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be a full nine weeks between
spraying and harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that's long enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you're not fucking up and
spraying too heavily concentrated of
[SPEAKER_00]: anything on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I would really spray in
flower is like a compost tea, maybe some
[SPEAKER_00]: push.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like hitting them a lot in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: One reason you don't want to spray them
when they're in flower is because the buds
[SPEAKER_00]: start bulking up and the moisture gets
inside the bud and you do run the risk of
[SPEAKER_00]: promoting bud rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big reason why I talk about not
spraying in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you're going to mess up the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to mess up the taste of those
buds that you're growing for nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why spray some shit on them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck up the flavor when you can leave them
the way they are and it tastes super
[SPEAKER_00]: delicious if you do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing I just thought of that I
didn't say, let the soil dry, throw down
[SPEAKER_00]: some diatomaceous earth, soak with the
evergreen, spray with the evergreen,
[SPEAKER_00]: put up the yellow and blue sticky cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be golden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shouldn't have any bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should get rid of most of your bug
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope unless you've got a serious
infestation that should really solve like
[SPEAKER_00]: 75% of your bug problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys, of course, another thing
you can do to get rid of your thrips are
[SPEAKER_00]: pirate bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bug called the minute pirate
bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aureus insidious, the sucker's ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: He eats thrips, whiteflies, spider mites,
aphids, and all kinds of other stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: He loves to get in there and eat stuff in
your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a very versatile insect.
[SPEAKER_00]: He will thrive in an indoor and a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's something I highly recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also predatory mites, the Swarovski
mites that I recommended for your spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mites will also work very well on thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, now I hope you are
able to identify thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a little fucker's been
crawling on your plants and shitting this
[SPEAKER_00]: shiny stuff and just chewing holes in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of looks like there's glitter on your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the leaves are starting to curl up
and wilt a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're starting to look dry in certain
patches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're getting a little bit crispy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably got thrips in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to get out of magnifying glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to identify exactly what you've
got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's time to treat for probably
thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you learned a
lot from me on this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
friends at the Dude Grows Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dude Grows podcast gave the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeffs specifically, White Mike
specifically, we all got personal huge
[SPEAKER_00]: shout outs from the Dude Grows Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were also given personal invitations to
the Dude Grows event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Myself, White Mike, the Dabbing Granny,
Lindsay the Traveling Stoner, and Chris,
[SPEAKER_00]: also known as Bobo Blaster Co.,
were all given open invitations to come to
[SPEAKER_00]: the Dude Grows event, which is kind of a
private party that he is hosting in April.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, if you are listening to this,
Dude and Scotty both, much respect,
[SPEAKER_00]: much thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to bring my Zoom H6,
and I'm going to try to record a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal is just to record part of the
event, and then I will send you the file,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we will both hopefully post it up as a
podcast together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I have in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to try to do that,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friends at the Dude
Grows Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, since I'm spreading love to
podcasters, I want to give a huge shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out to Bo Nellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bo Nellis has been giving me a lot of
respect, and I want her to know that the
[SPEAKER_00]: respect is completely returned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love to everybody in the cannabis
podcasting community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love seeing us come together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love seeing us share information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel no intimidation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel there's no competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it all to be a community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love, much respect to everybody,
spreading the word and fighting the good
[SPEAKER_00]: fight for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are all on one team, and I appreciate
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to do a podcast with everybody
out there that's got a cannabis podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can all get together and do shows and
expose each other's audience to each
[SPEAKER_00]: other's audiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'd be a great thing to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I would love to hear
