head my brain Anyway, great concentrates

were super super smooth I felt like I took
[SPEAKER_00]: a little tiny dab and got a whole bunch of
smoke remember I was talking about I go

super heavy and I don't get lit and then I

little tiny dab and I get super wrecked

where I could take a little tiny dab and I
[SPEAKER_00]: get super duper wrecked It's been pretty

[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to PL grow Okay in the last
episode I mentioned that I was going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: to Best Buy and pick up the MacBook and I
would let you know how that went let you
[SPEAKER_00]: know if I had to act a fool Let you know
if they were nice and polite So here's how
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole story goes Well, we'll start
from the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to go buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked into Best Buy and I was like,
hey I've got this picture of this computer
[SPEAKER_00]: on my screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like this please and like oh give me a
few minutes I'll find that for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went to go find it and he came back
With a bewildered look on his face and he
[SPEAKER_00]: said sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate to say this I can't find that
computer in my store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, well, I've got money I'd like
to buy it now if you've got it just to
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage him, you know, like maybe he
thought I was just browsing or something
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let him know I've got money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will take it if you can find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna look for it So I looked around
and him and another guy came up the other
[SPEAKER_00]: guy claimed to be the inventory manager
He's like sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot find that computer here,
but we can order it for you So they
[SPEAKER_00]: ordered it in from another store and they
also gave me a pretty fat discount for
[SPEAKER_00]: making me wait around and having to look
for it So I got a nice deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ordered the computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They told me it would be here on Thursday
Wednesday night at 855.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got an email saying hey your computer is
available The shitty part about that is
[SPEAKER_00]: the store closed at 9 o'clock and it's
about 20 minutes away from my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was kind of just a big tease.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, hey your computer is in here
You can come stare at it through the
[SPEAKER_00]: window if you'd like, but that's the best
you can do tonight So I had to wait till
[SPEAKER_00]: the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to work all day I kept saying it's I
would like to leave a little bit early I
[SPEAKER_00]: would like to leave just a little bit
early, but I'm the manager I can usually
[SPEAKER_00]: make that happen, but fate was just not
letting it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything needed my attention So I had to
work a little extra late that day But I
[SPEAKER_00]: did get off work and I did make it to Best
Buy and here's the part you guys want to
[SPEAKER_00]: hear I walked into Best Buy And I said
hey, I'm here to pick up my computer and
[SPEAKER_00]: she said you have an ID and I showed her
my ID and she turned around and She picked
[SPEAKER_00]: up a box off of the counter and she set it
down and she said have a good day sir And
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked out with my computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not have to act a fool I got to
high-five the guy on the way out and drove
[SPEAKER_00]: home and played with my new computer So I
got the new MacBook you guys it took me a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit to get some things set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one The Tascam software did not
want to install but we got tech guy Tony
[SPEAKER_00]: over here and Tony helped me out shout out
to Tony Thanks for coming over on such
[SPEAKER_00]: short notice, bro, and we got it running
So the new MacBook is in action ladies and
[SPEAKER_00]: gentlemen Big thanks and a huge shout out
to everybody who contributed to the
[SPEAKER_00]: patreon campaign You guys covered probably
half if not a little more on the cost of
[SPEAKER_00]: this new machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope the show sounds good I'm sure it's
gonna be easier to load the show and it
[SPEAKER_00]: will be easier to make videos And now I've
got two machines that I can make YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: videos on on which I can make YouTube
videos Sorry, I'm trying to be nerdy with
[SPEAKER_00]: my English and now that means I can speed
up my production Process will get caught
[SPEAKER_00]: up in less time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on with the podcast ladies and
gentlemen, I Have got an email from a
[SPEAKER_00]: friend of ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a long email I'm not going to
read the whole thing on the air A lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: it was just kind of a personal thing to me
He asked a couple of questions that don't
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be read on the air But there is
part that I want to put on the show So I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna start from the beginning and then
we'll get to the part I want to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: it goes a lot like this Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a while since I've messaged you
I'm still listening every week and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: still supporting You in all you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey good to hear from me man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks again for supporting me He goes
on to say thank you again for being such a
[SPEAKER_00]: great resource I'm emailing you to ask you
a question and maybe a favor God knows you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't owe me anything and you have no idea
who I really am But I'll try to keep this
[SPEAKER_00]: short and maybe let you know where I'm
coming from He says if you refer to my
[SPEAKER_00]: previous previous email I'm from
Albuquerque, New Mexico and a big fan of
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast and your art Recently,
I have acquired my medical marijuana card
[SPEAKER_00]: in New Mexico and I'm fully legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a difference In feeling it is what a
difference in feeling it is to walk out of
[SPEAKER_00]: a shop and know I'm not a criminal in the
eyes of the law Man, that is such a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that the first time I went to
go buy medical marijuana and I walked out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the place and I was like dude You just
walked out of the weed place loud and
[SPEAKER_00]: proud with weed and everyone knows that's
the weed place and you're walking to you
[SPEAKER_00]: and I had to like calm myself down and
think oh Yeah, that's the weed store and
[SPEAKER_00]: you got a weed card in your pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is such a great feeling It's almost
surreal the first couple of times and then
[SPEAKER_00]: that first Time that you're driving and
you got your weed in the car and the cops
[SPEAKER_00]: get behind you and you're like,
oh shit And you go, oh wait, never mind
[SPEAKER_00]: and all your worries go away because the
only thing I used to do that would get me
[SPEAKER_00]: in trouble is have some herb in the car
Now I'm totally golden All right,
[SPEAKER_00]: the email goes on he says I had never
cared much for being legal and always
[SPEAKER_00]: feared being on in the system or on some
sort of a list I'm also not your
[SPEAKER_00]: stereotypical stoner nothing against my
stoner bros But I do not fit the mold and
[SPEAKER_00]: people generally assume I do not partake
contrary to this belief, however I am
[SPEAKER_00]: highly knowledgeable about cannabis and I
have consumed countless hours of content
[SPEAKER_00]: and research I've been a closet activist
and a literal closet glower grower for a
[SPEAKER_00]: very long time Rasta Jeff You have
inspired me I am 33 and I am on a and I am
[SPEAKER_00]: a new father and I'm a full-time employee
of the local university After going
[SPEAKER_00]: through some complications with my son's
birth and having a small interaction with
[SPEAKER_00]: child services I've become fully motivated
and becoming a positive face in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you for for Joining us so
strongly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for becoming a face in the
cannabis movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need more articulate Strong-minded
people like yourself joining this
[SPEAKER_00]: movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for jumping in with us He also
says nothing negative came from this
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction But I came out of it with a
better understanding of the law's point of
[SPEAKER_00]: view I've held myself back and I feel I
have kept my talents and my heart to
[SPEAKER_00]: myself and I am ready to fulfill my
destiny so to speak So here's my question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said I had for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He asks What qualifies someone to be a
master grower?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he also says for lack of better
term That's I kind of want to jump off on
[SPEAKER_00]: a rant right there In Colorado the term
master grower is a huge joke It's one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the most cringy terms or words or phrases
you could throw out in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry right now Anybody that's been
growing cannabis For quite a while before
[SPEAKER_00]: this medical marijuana movement cringes at
the phrase master grower Technically
[SPEAKER_00]: master grower simply means that you are
the boss of the cultivation facility You
[SPEAKER_00]: are the lead grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is another term for lead grower I wish
everybody would just change their badge
[SPEAKER_00]: from master grower to lead grower or
cultivation director or cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: manager Or something just a little less
douchey and egotistical sounding is
[SPEAKER_00]: calling yourself a master grower is like
saying that you're the black belt that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have got all of the Knowledge that you are
the champion that you could head kick
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody that you know all the forms all
the tricks and a lot of us Are not
[SPEAKER_00]: masters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the most qualified and most
experienced grower in my facility which
[SPEAKER_00]: makes me the cultivation leader or the
cultivation director but a Lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: so technically it's a position.
[SPEAKER_00]: It technically it's a title.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a stamp on your paycheck position
master grower Culturally and Societally it
[SPEAKER_00]: is more of a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody takes you seriously if you say I'm
the master grower So that's just something
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to touch on here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phrase master grower is kind of a joke
But you don't mean it in that way You're
[SPEAKER_00]: asking what does it take to be a master
grower and then you even said for example
[SPEAKER_00]: or lack of better term You just want to
know what it takes to be at that level
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says I refer to myself as a humble
green thumb and I'm not very outspoken
[SPEAKER_00]: about my talent But the proof is in my
pudding I'm grounded in caregiving and I
[SPEAKER_00]: follow exactly in line With your thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you call a guy like me?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call a guy like you a cultivation
manager a cultivation director Now if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to be a master grower and the terms
and the not douchey terms in the terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: a black belt grower as in the terms of a
cultivation manager what you need is
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivation experience you definitely need
Cultivation experience you have to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to look at plants and say that plants too
wet that plant is too dry that Is powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew that is spider mite damage those
plants are too close together Those plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are too far apart that light is too close
to those plants You have to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify what's going on with the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is going on with the room?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to identify things on the fly
every day at a rapid pace You have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to think and adjust and adapt you
have to know You have to keep track of 20
[SPEAKER_00]: different rooms and know how much water
has gone in each room for the past couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of days You have to be able to manage
People you have to have an eye for detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have a passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be there and you have to give
a shit That's what you need to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: master grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you possess all of these
qualities Don't be in too much of a hurry
[SPEAKER_00]: to call yourself a master grower Keep
calling yourself the humble green thumb
[SPEAKER_00]: because those are the best master growers
The humble green thumbs are the guys that
[SPEAKER_00]: should be running the large facilities You
know what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go at a certain pace to where you
work fast enough, but you don't rush
[SPEAKER_00]: through anything You get everything done
without screwing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't drag your feet You can lead the
other people to keep them going at a fast
[SPEAKER_00]: pace You can make a plan You can make a
schedule and you can encourage your team
[SPEAKER_00]: to do what needs to be done in a timely
manner and keep it fun and have everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: motivated and encouraged and still get all
of the shit done and break a sweat and at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the day Everybody is proud of
what they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like you could do that That's
what a master grower needs to do in a
[SPEAKER_00]: large cultivation facility It's basically
the same thing that any other boss needs
[SPEAKER_00]: to do in any position Plus you have to
have specialized skills for your industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is cannabis knowledge Now you have
to have knowledge all the way through the
[SPEAKER_00]: process You have to know how to cut a
clone and you have to know how to get it
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way to the store So knowledge of
the full cannabis growth cycle is
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary Knowledge of how to identify and
manage pests is necessary and diseases all
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant stuff also you have to be able
to pay attention to electrical HVAC
[SPEAKER_00]: plumbing Also, you have to manage
employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you have to communicate between the
employees and ownership and whoever else
[SPEAKER_00]: you may have I've got contractors in the
grower or in the grow On average three
[SPEAKER_00]: days a week if it's not an electrician a
plumber Maybe an HVAC guy if not the
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Agriculture or the
Department of Health There's somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in to do something you have to be
able to communicate with All different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of personalities You have to be able
to give instructions you have to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to deal with employees that Kind of don't
follow instructions properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be able to correct things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be able to document things You
have to be able to give praise You have to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn how to separate your dab time and
your work time and your friendship and
[SPEAKER_00]: your management from your co-workers
Because once we go to lunch, I take off
[SPEAKER_00]: the name tag and we're friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna take some dabs We're gonna
hang out even if you're the owner You're
[SPEAKER_00]: the only employee that fucked everything
up all day when we go to lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're friends We're gonna be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to learn how to keep that balance
You have to be able to discipline your
[SPEAKER_00]: friends You have to be able to fire and
write your friends up when the time comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are things like any job that are
going to be part of being a master grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: but The way you are trying to be
qualified.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you were doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You love the plant You have passion you
have an intention for detail and you care
[SPEAKER_00]: about what you're doing and it sounds like
since you work at a university you were
[SPEAKER_00]: able to communicate and through The email
you sent you can certainly communicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's basically what it takes to be a
master grower You continue to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: humble green thumb and you will find a
position as a master grower I'm gonna keep
[SPEAKER_00]: reading a little bit of the email and then
we're gonna cut it out short because some
[SPEAKER_00]: of this was just for me Like I said,
he said what do you call a guy like me?
[SPEAKER_00]: I call you a passionate grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call you highly qualified I call you
somebody that I respect as a grower He
[SPEAKER_00]: goes on to say I have worked with both
small personal and large commercial grows
[SPEAKER_00]: I have listened to every grow from your
heart episode as well as all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis growing and culture podcasts
available on my iPhone I follow and watch
[SPEAKER_00]: with all I follow and watch all of the
very best no-till and sustainable growers
[SPEAKER_00]: I have found and Then he goes on to say
that he's got all this cannabis knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: and skills But nothing to show for it
except for a few jars of quality medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: and his iry feelings Unfortunately,
a lot of people Will feel that way in this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and when you're trying to get
into this industry You can't bring your
[SPEAKER_00]: product To the dispensary to show at least
in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's illegal to show up with product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't come to an interview with
product You're in New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got different rules there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can probably Bring in your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know but if you can't and you feel
like you don't have anything to show for
[SPEAKER_00]: it a lot of these jobs are not hiring
based on your growth skills and your
[SPEAKER_00]: outcome a lot of them are hiring based on
Do you fit with the team?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does your personality work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you be on time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you we ask trick questions in the
interview to see if you can catch On see
[SPEAKER_00]: if you can follow instructions We ask
questions to we're kind of milking
[SPEAKER_00]: information out of you the first and fifth
question were the same question You just
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't realize it and you answered them
differently and we started writing notes
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's the kind of shit that goes on
in interviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, keep that in mind So we're trying to
check out your personality We're making
[SPEAKER_00]: sure you mesh with the team that you're
responsible that you're honest that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: reliable And those are the things that you
need to bring to the interview And this is
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody I'm not just saying this for the
guy that sent me the email This is for
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody if you're going for a cannabis

Colorado facility you have from what I can
[SPEAKER_00]: tell by your email It sounds like you've
got the qualifications the way to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: earn that title would be to start at a
grow Don't be afraid to take a trimmer
[SPEAKER_00]: position.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to take a grotech position
I started in my position as a grotech.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the bottom There's a trimmer and
then there's grotechs and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: hierarchy moves up to my position my
90-day review I was promoted to
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation director or master Grower so
go somewhere prove yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to start at the bottom and
you can be promoted to master grower Now
[SPEAKER_00]: one thing that a master of anything would
do is keep learning if you go in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: you start as a trimmer You trim like a
maniac.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on time for work every day You
follow instructions you volunteer to help
[SPEAKER_00]: when there's more work to do you get
promoted to grotech?
[SPEAKER_00]: You become a good grotech one of the
growers gets sick doesn't show up Now
[SPEAKER_00]: you're you've got his position now you are
hanging out with the lead grower the
[SPEAKER_00]: master grower all day every day Work in
hand-in-hand with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be mad that you can't get his
position because it's taken your job now
[SPEAKER_00]: is to absorb Everything you can about
commercial production about cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation on a large scale Absorb
everything you can be present Don't be
[SPEAKER_00]: angry that you're not getting the position
you want be present and be excited about
[SPEAKER_00]: the free education You're getting while
you're getting paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're becoming a better grower You're
building your resume one thing you should
[SPEAKER_00]: do while you're in these facilities is
write down everything You learn if you
[SPEAKER_00]: learn a new piece of equipment a new tool
a new method a new trick a new technique a
[SPEAKER_00]: new idea Write it down add it to your grow
journal add it to your resume If you can
[SPEAKER_00]: drive a scissor lift now because you
worked in a cultivation facility put that
[SPEAKER_00]: on your resume If you can drive a scissor
lift or a forklift, it makes you much more
[SPEAKER_00]: hireable for my facility because we get
deliveries We need the forklift if there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a guy that can't drive the forklift or
there's no one that no one there that can
[SPEAKER_00]: drive the forklift That shit stays on the
truck and the truck drives away and comes
[SPEAKER_00]: back when it can so if you were able to
operate A forklift you're much more
[SPEAKER_00]: hireable the scissor lift.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to change bulbs the guy that knows
how to use the scissor lift We call him in
[SPEAKER_00]: he gets extra hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can drive that scissor lift put up the
bulbs So that kind of stuff helps write
[SPEAKER_00]: down everything you do and then you will
get to be the master grower in a facility
[SPEAKER_00]: in this email He mentions our friend
mentions that he was offered a job,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the place does not grow from their
heart So he's going to be patient and try
[SPEAKER_00]: to find himself a job that meets his
standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: I applaud you for that I applaud you for
not compromising your standards just For
[SPEAKER_00]: employment in the industry you want to
work in that means that you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow from your heart That when you do find
a facility that appreciates your heart and
[SPEAKER_00]: your care for the plant that you're going
to give them your all So be patient keep
[SPEAKER_00]: looking until you find a facility that
does work for you I do have friends down
[SPEAKER_00]: there at organ tica and albuquerque I
don't know what I could do by pulling
[SPEAKER_00]: strings because honestly The only thing I
know you buy is your screen name and your

reading on the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it was personal So I used what I
could my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the great email you guys if
you'd like to send me an email My email
[SPEAKER_00]: address is grow from your heart at hotmail
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to get your emails so I can

[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another email here Let's get
right into this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, this one says Ross to Jeff I'm a new
grower and so Cal and I really enjoy your
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you And I appreciate that he
goes on to say on your next seed
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you also cover auto flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really interested in doing auto
flowers outdoors to maximize the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest per year What do you think and
then he also says thanks for sharing your
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome knowledge and being a positive
force Peace and then he signed it with his
[SPEAKER_00]: name He knows his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't say if you wanted me to say it
or not So dude, thanks for the email big
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, he said on your next seed
discussion Could you also cover auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't grow or mess with auto
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a lot of experience You said
you were interested in doing auto flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors to maximize the number of harvest
per year What do I think I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: everything I know about auto flowers that
is the perfect reason for auto flower
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds a lot of people hate on feminized
seeds a lot of people have hatred for auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flower seeds, I believe that everything
has its application and Your purpose is
[SPEAKER_00]: the perfect application for auto flower
seeds You can maximize your number of
[SPEAKER_00]: harvests outdoors because you don't have
to have a veg time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's beautiful I think that your
intention is Going to work perfectly with
[SPEAKER_00]: auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna get what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um There was a large bust in southern
Colorado just about 45 minutes south of me
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a national forest and a Cartel had
set up an illegal grow in that national
[SPEAKER_00]: forest and they were growing cannabis on a
large scale and when they got caught it
[SPEAKER_00]: was not the right season for cannabis to
be flowering and the pictures that they
[SPEAKER_00]: showed were straight-up flowering plants
and fields of plants in different stages
[SPEAKER_00]: and Me and my weed head friends were
sitting here watching the news and looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at the pictures going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait a minute How did they do that because
it's if you know about growing cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's an annual plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put it outside and it flowers because
Of the Sun cycle because of the night
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of the plants are outside How are
some of them flower this far?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are some of them flower this far and
how are some of them still in veg?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it dawned on me they're using
fucking auto flowers and they're just
[SPEAKER_00]: plotting different sized plots So they've
got a perpetual grow happening with auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers on other people's property on the
national forest land So yes, it is very
[SPEAKER_00]: very Feasible and that is a very good
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very good application.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's honestly the best application for
auto flowers Is to run them outdoors so
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can maximize the number of
harvest outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope the auto flowers work for you I
hope you're able to maximize your harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're able to get some high
potency auto flowers The only downside to
[SPEAKER_00]: auto flowers is that you have to keep
buying new seeds Hopefully the cost of not
[SPEAKER_00]: having to veg them and the opportunity to
maximize the number of harvests Offsets
[SPEAKER_00]: the price of having to buy new seeds for
every run because that's the only the only
[SPEAKER_00]: catch there is if you weren't running auto
flowers You could just cut clones and put
[SPEAKER_00]: more out there, but then you'd have to veg
them You'd have to have space you'd have
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a mom plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're doing is perfect I have no
problems with your use of auto flowers and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm usually kind of a hater on auto flower
seeds So dude, thank you for the great
[SPEAKER_00]: email and thanks for the opportunity to
teach my listeners a Very good application
[SPEAKER_00]: for auto flowers you guys quit hating the
auto flowers because this is gonna work
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this guy is going to get more
harvests next year than you it may be auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flower bud But he's going to have more of
it and he's gonna have more frequent
[SPEAKER_00]: harvests and it's All gonna be outdoor
sunshine bud and he's not gonna have to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a veg space So good hating on the
auto flowers you guys this guy is gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: kick some ass with auto flowers this
season All right, but this whole year shit
[SPEAKER_00]: not even the season his season is all year
you get one season So don't make fun of
[SPEAKER_00]: the auto flowers anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys we found a perfect application
here on the show Hey, dude, I know my
[SPEAKER_00]: answer was super short and I did not give
a lot of details But you uh you asked if
[SPEAKER_00]: this was gonna work basically and yes,
this is gonna work beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have got the perfect idea for auto
Flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's gonna work man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's move on to this next
email This next email comes from somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: who is very smart because they said right
away if this makes it to the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't read my name, but I will read
the subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says happy st.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patty's day from Ireland ladies and
gentlemen We've got listeners in Ireland a
[SPEAKER_00]: big shout out to everybody out there in
Ireland listening to the podcast I do not
[SPEAKER_00]: know the rules on cannabis in Ireland,
although I would assume they do not
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerate cannabis They don't seem like
they take much bullshit Seems like a place
[SPEAKER_00]: that if you fall out of line, you will
quickly be put back in line So be careful
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're growing consuming or possessing
or even talking about cannabis in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know if I'm wrong I'm really
curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the temperature on cannabis there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, the email goes on it says many
congratulations on 300 episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you I appreciate that he also
says I've listened to them all most of
[SPEAKER_00]: them twice Thanks to the throwback
Thursday's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that is commitment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's dedication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you and I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've had to listen to me for a lot of
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry You've had to hear my voice
drone on about nothing for so much The
[SPEAKER_00]: message goes on to say I am a chef and I
work alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you keep me company during prep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks for hanging out, man Anyway,
the email keeps going and he says I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: a grower Given we are deep in Prohibition
land the first few steps on the road to
[SPEAKER_00]: medical have been taken in Ireland But
nothing approaching freedom yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we really enjoyed the grow episodes in
particular He also says I'm currently
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking some UK cheese, but missing the
quality of flower I enjoyed in California
[SPEAKER_00]: He said they were smoking orange AK from
harvest off mission in San Francisco and
[SPEAKER_00]: green crack from kind love in Denver were
our favorite flowers we tried That green
[SPEAKER_00]: crack from kind love is a great product I
actually know the consultant that set that
[SPEAKER_00]: grow up and I have got the same Clone of
that green crack in my garden at three
[SPEAKER_00]: rivers and it is a great cut So that is
quality product kind love is one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite dispensaries In Denver if I were
going to go shopping, so I'm not bashing
[SPEAKER_00]: kind love.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are kind of a premium dispensary
They've got some of the higher prices But
[SPEAKER_00]: they've also got some of the better
products if I'm looking to spend money for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis for a concert I haven't had a
harvest in a while kind of love is one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the few places I consider shopping Also,
of course three rivers because I grow that
[SPEAKER_00]: product But if I'm looking to spend too
much money kind of love is where I go
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, he says we didn't get around to
dabs yet too much Gear to sort for
[SPEAKER_00]: tourists.
[SPEAKER_00]: See I totally understand that the next
time you're in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know I've got all of the gear You
won't have to sort any of it and you won't
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like a tourist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll feel like you're right at home
We'll go to some cool places.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will have a good time But the email
wraps up saying anyway, I'll have a smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: and go annoy my mother for you best of
luck and big hugs to you and Yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey my friend from Ireland huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the email huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the support I really like
hearing from my friends in other
[SPEAKER_00]: countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's neat To know that somebody in Ireland
is listening to my podcast right now It's
[SPEAKER_00]: even more neat knowing that you were
unable to participate in what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: teaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't grow It's probably hard to
consume there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're taking the first steps toward
medical But it's extra neat to know that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're listening even though you can't do
what I'm saying You're kind of living out
[SPEAKER_00]: the dream vicariously probably a little
bit but you're still enjoying the show
[SPEAKER_00]: even though you aren't able to practice
what you're being taught which means I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: Entertaining you and keeping your
attention enough to keep you here Even
[SPEAKER_00]: though you can't do the stuff that means a
lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for the huge compliment I
hope you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know your mom for me.
