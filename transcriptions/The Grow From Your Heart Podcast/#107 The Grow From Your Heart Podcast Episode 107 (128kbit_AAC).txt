that there's an issue Usually Stitcher
[SPEAKER_01]: just goes and corrects it really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The show is it's available on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's available on my website.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read genetics colorado.com For some
reason it did not work on Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Stitcher's problem I can tell because
it's playing on my iPhone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's playing on my computer I just will
not play through Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I apologize if you guys did not get to

I gotta reach for my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got one more thing I want to talk
about before we start getting down to the
[SPEAKER_01]: heart of the show Gotta unlock the phone
here you guys I got a screenshot of
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we put a lot of work into this
podcast I take time out of my day I take
[SPEAKER_01]: time out of my life Mike takes time away
from his family to come over here and
[SPEAKER_01]: record Mike works 40 something hours A
week in the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting him to come over for an hour is
actually a little effort I got an email
[SPEAKER_01]: that makes all of our time all of our
effort worthwhile These are the emails
[SPEAKER_01]: that really make it worth putting in the
energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this came from somebody We'll just call
it Mike Oh and he says the podcast is
[SPEAKER_01]: great best show I've listened best show
and I've listened to them all hoping you
[SPEAKER_01]: will do more shows With longer content
like the earlier episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to see a pest management
episode and more bh o shows I'm in
[SPEAKER_01]: Michigan and took a tenure hiatus from
growing after Cloning the shit out of
[SPEAKER_01]: super skunk seed smuggled back from
Amsterdam in 93 shit sure change since oh
[SPEAKER_01]: four had to learn about He lists a bunch
of stuff he had to learn about and then he
[SPEAKER_01]: keeps it going for a minute And he says
I've listened to all the grow shows Adam
[SPEAKER_01]: Dunn dude grows Kyle Cushman and then he
says yours is the best by far a great mix
[SPEAKER_01]: of knowledge humor and irreverence in a
very easy to listen to style I'm almost
[SPEAKER_01]: done re listening to the entire series
again Great job, brother, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do a dab for you signed Mike dude
Thanks Mike, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says we are the best podcast.

[SPEAKER_01]: fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for listening to the podcast The
email is turned off over here this email
[SPEAKER_01]: coil needs to be replaced But when we do a
dab the next tab that we do is for Mike
[SPEAKER_01]: and I've got I get plenty of emails like
that But it was time to read one on the
[SPEAKER_01]: air and say dude check this out This is
what comes I probably get an email or a
[SPEAKER_01]: text message or an Instagram message or a
Facebook message once a day saying Thanks

[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know what you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna sneeze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh It didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about it and scared it away
Alright, so we do have a real topic we
[SPEAKER_01]: want to talk about here But I want to talk
about one more thing since since Mike is a
[SPEAKER_01]: little familiar with this region of life I
got the privilege on Monday morning of
[SPEAKER_01]: going to jury duty at 8 a.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: On a cold-ass Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep I got lucky the last time I had to do
was during the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean at least I wasn't cold,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're gonna be there bright and
early and it's fucking cold and it was so
[SPEAKER_01]: windy It was one of the windiest days of
the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had a debt jury duty on a really nasty
day Yeah, it was weird because the the
[SPEAKER_01]: courtroom has skylight sort of windows
that are kind of tinted behind the judge
[SPEAKER_01]: and They were changing from black to baby
blue to black to baby blue with the
[SPEAKER_01]: weather every like 10 minutes I was like,
holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on outside it?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was crazy So I had jury duty and
obviously I was not selected I have never
[SPEAKER_01]: selected to be a part of the jury I get
down to when they start asking questions
[SPEAKER_01]: and then like oh you can go home but uh,
I Went in there with a certain thing in
[SPEAKER_01]: mind of what I was going to see and
experience and how I was gonna handle shit
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was nothing like what I expected.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's it's not at all like it appears
on television exactly and the chairs are
[SPEAKER_02]: just as uncomfortable as they appear on
television if not significantly more so
[SPEAKER_02]: but other than that very Few similarities
it was like they were mad at us and made
[SPEAKER_02]: us sit in shitty church pews it When
you're in them, it feels like it was
[SPEAKER_02]: designed to punish everyone that was
selected significantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, so Wow, the thing that stood out the
most to me I'm afraid of judges just
[SPEAKER_01]: straight up a judge can say you are going
to jail and you get to do some time in
[SPEAKER_01]: jail you get to go get butt-poked for a
little bit and There's nothing you can do
[SPEAKER_01]: about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: The judge that resided over that courtroom
was cool as fuck Like I don't know the
[SPEAKER_01]: judge personally, but he presented himself
fairly I didn't feel like he was passing
[SPEAKER_01]: judgment on anybody by the way They looked
he treated the guys in suits and the lady
[SPEAKER_01]: in her sweatpants exactly the same he was
kind to everybody who was respectful and
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a human about things I figured it
was gonna be rigorous and like the time
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything would be on a certain time
schedule and stuff and he went for a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of time and he goes anybody
need to use the restroom or anything Can
[SPEAKER_01]: we wait another 15 minutes and everyone's
like I can wait 15 and he's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay We'll go in 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys don't worry and he looked up the
clock and he was oh, sorry It's been about
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 minutes you guys let's go use the
restroom We'll take 15 and like he was
[SPEAKER_01]: actually pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know there at this point for the
most part It runs like it should like it's
[SPEAKER_02]: much more functional in I don't know human
and a lot of people assume I know judges
[SPEAKER_02]: like I've met many of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's right there people too and that's
what I said Mike's a little more in that
[SPEAKER_01]: realm Mike has experience in that side of
life and I I'm the dreadlock I Got
[SPEAKER_01]: dreadlocks to my ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got red eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I smell like cannabis most of the time I
try to avoid those types of folks,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know now that things are changing
I'm gonna have to mingle and rub some
[SPEAKER_01]: elbows with those types of people but the
judge was very fair I did not feel
[SPEAKER_01]: intimidated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't feel afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may have given me a Touch of faith in
our system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a touch more It's nice to know that
there's at least humans involved like
[SPEAKER_02]: we've seen it from just the juror
selection part They didn't kick us out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't kick out the rejected jurors
until all of the jurors had been chosen so
[SPEAKER_01]: that they knew that there were enough in
the pool and I got to watch the selection
[SPEAKER_01]: process and I got to watch all of the
jurors be interviewed and then at the end
[SPEAKER_01]: of that the two Lawyers the prosecutor the
prosecution and the defense Passed back
[SPEAKER_01]: and forth a piece of paper and they agree
on which people are gonna be the jurors
[SPEAKER_01]: and I was laughing I was like it's like
fantasy football for the lawyers or
[SPEAKER_01]: something if and they're like I'll trade
you the angry white guy for the White lady
[SPEAKER_01]: and like I could just see him negotiating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew who was gonna go home I was like
they're gonna get rid of that guy like
[SPEAKER_01]: he's too angry and he's too mad He wants
this guy to go to jail before he's even
[SPEAKER_02]: heard the case We the last two times I
went the first time I got let go before
[SPEAKER_02]: any of that started even I never even made
it to the courtroom They called all but
[SPEAKER_02]: like 20 of us and was like the rest of you
can go home Like just no ceremony about we
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't have to sign out or nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't care the first time I went
that's what happened There was a case that
[SPEAKER_01]: we were gonna see that day and the lady
That was supposed to be in that case
[SPEAKER_01]: committed another crime and had been
Rearrested was going to jail and was gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: be retried for all of her shit So yeah,
she got me out of jury duty that day,
[SPEAKER_01]: but she fucked up her life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know and then the last time they They
got down to like 30 people that they liked
[SPEAKER_02]: and they just waved that the rest of us
when I go home and so we all got to go
[SPEAKER_02]: home at lunch, which was nice,
but I've had friends that have selected
[SPEAKER_02]: and served on juries and it's a hell of an
experience, you know since You guys if you
[SPEAKER_01]: did not listen to episode number 106,
I no longer work at the spot dispensary I
[SPEAKER_01]: just wanted to put that out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I quit the spot I know work at green and
healthy wellness in Colorado Springs quick
[SPEAKER_02]: update.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah quick update just since 106 may have
been unlistenable on some devices Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I quit the spot guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry I had to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work at green and healthy wellness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm now the Grover there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in Colorado Springs We're gonna crush
it shout out to hunt but I was in jury
[SPEAKER_01]: duty And I'm sitting here thinking I don't
have to work tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ain't got shit to do I wouldn't mind
being selected for a case.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have been kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have been A very learning
experience for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I hate to imagine it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now if I'm ever in court I know how it
goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, and I've got a little experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's I'm not gonna shit my pants the first
time I want to invite Mike while he's
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting here in front of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get a commitment out of you guys I
want you to come to an episode with me
[SPEAKER_01]: about how to deal with you how to conduct
yourself with a law enforcement Oh sure
[SPEAKER_01]: whether you're being pulled over whether
they're coming to your home whether you're
[SPEAKER_01]: in public whether you're at a smoking
event I'd like to get you and We'll get
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody else on the show, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a good idea I think we're gonna get
sloppy and you on the show Because that's
[SPEAKER_02]: that'll that'll make for a really
interesting show.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes sloppy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're invited We have such different
exactly Experiences with law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I want to get both you guys on
the show and we can talk about how to deal
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about how to deal with law
enforcement and not get your ass thrown in
[SPEAKER_01]: jail All right guys So I must have blown a
couple of dabs into the computer because
[SPEAKER_01]: as I was saying that part about the judge
It totally just quit recording here The
[SPEAKER_01]: computer is too dabbed out something went
wrong that means that we're gonna have to
[SPEAKER_01]: start running an auxiliary output from the
the USB down here or the mixer into the H6
[SPEAKER_01]: and do record this bitch in case that
happens again And then I can just keep
[SPEAKER_01]: recording the H6 would have kept going
nice Yeah, or we'll go get a little Roland
[SPEAKER_01]: handheld recorder and use the headphone
out on the mixer and then just run that
[SPEAKER_01]: into the handheld Recorder and that just
records onto an SD card.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no failure the H6 would work
the handheld would work We'll do something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that as a backup plan or we can just
Take a dab when it fails and come back a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of minutes later and explain that
we just had a major technical failure here
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I like the third option that seems
simplest It's the cheapest if y'all were
[SPEAKER_02]: wondering like what kind of equipment
we're doing the show with just got a pile
[SPEAKER_02]: of equipment That's larger than your car.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is the home setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is to where this is so that you can
get the voice like there is a God cast
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's what that's for.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for all this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but the home base versions pretty
elaborate y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah the to-go version Is the size of a
big cell phone basically?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah when you hear me recording in the car
Morris's cell phone, maybe yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: Zach Morris's older cell phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the truth We just went fucking
saved by the bell on this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys the program crashed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to restart it I just give given a
shout out and had to restart a truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the truth I just given a shout out
to the judge that resided over that
[SPEAKER_01]: courtroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt that it was fair I like the way he
treated people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how much of that got
recorded, but I went to jury duty you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't that bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: The judge was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to move on From that and keep
going while the computer is working That
[SPEAKER_01]: email said that they wish I'd do more grow
lessons That'll come you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm I'm working on it I don't know if that
got recorded in the part before so we may
[SPEAKER_02]: have just double talk to that part More
girl lessons are coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so let's get to them You know us and
ask us what you want us to talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's yeah We may have said that before
recruit the appropriate people I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know if we're double talking so I don't
know how much of that made it to the
[SPEAKER_01]: recording But that's the truth you guys
gonna find out if you want more grow
[SPEAKER_01]: lessons All you gotta do is let me know
what you want to learn about send me an
[SPEAKER_01]: email to grow from your heart Hotmail calm
you can tweet me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at GF YH podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find me on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can send me a text message You can
that's all one memory file.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you like how that went?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Yeah, that's a lot of it was almost
like a Tourette's spasm to teach to teach
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I didn't mean to make fun interest
So I've got you guys want more grow
[SPEAKER_01]: lessons and should I understand you guys
would like the listener that sent me the
[SPEAKER_01]: email said that he would like more lessons
on BHO and he would like a pesticide issue
[SPEAKER_01]: or episode We will get our friend Sean
over here as soon as I can get him back
[SPEAKER_01]: and we will do an organic Pesticide
management episode and then I need to find
[SPEAKER_01]: ourselves some hash experts and we will do
some hash episodes I'm not a hash expert
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys that is not me Spence is a busy
motherfucker So getting him to come over
[SPEAKER_01]: here is gonna cost me like 50 bucks an
hour to get him to come record all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time But we'll get a hash expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get him to come on the show Let's
get down to the point of the show you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: have been going for 15 minutes and all
we've done is talk a bunch of nonsense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um We've been covering this a little bit
lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got three news articles I'm going to
read the headline to and then we're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: skip all of that and then we're gonna go
to the main article that I want to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about But this is kind of a little bit of
a buildup on the on the website called the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis Which is where I find a lot of my
news big shout out to David Magoya and
[SPEAKER_01]: Ricardo Baca for supplying the world with
up-to-date cannabis news from Colorado I
[SPEAKER_01]: found an article this one was written on
November 13th and it says pesticide edict
[SPEAKER_01]: ensures fate of recalled Denver pot
products the byline is nearly 30,000
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana infused products recalled over
pesticide concerns will likely be
[SPEAKER_01]: Destroyed after a Hickenlooper says their
public safety risk Here's another article
[SPEAKER_01]: just in the headline you guys is all I'm
gonna read this one once again was in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis that says Denver based lab 710
recalls pot products over pesticides and
[SPEAKER_01]: then the byline is in the state's eighth
pot recall in 10 months lab 710
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrates calls back 2362 packages of
marijuana concentrates and then here is
[SPEAKER_01]: the third one that I want to read the
headline to it says Denver Issues this one
[SPEAKER_01]: was written on November 18th once again by
Ricardo Baca and David Magoya of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis It says Denver issues 9th pot
product recall in 10 weeks Then the byline
[SPEAKER_01]: is Edible's company guys garden issues its
second voluntary recall in as many weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: after banned pesticides are detected in
products you guys this is an upsetting
[SPEAKER_01]: trend we've been seeing here in Colorado
in the Commercial growing industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not uh depends on your perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay It's I really hate that we're
finding pesticides and final product,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'm so thrilled That we're finding
pesticides and final product like it's
[SPEAKER_02]: this weird duality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, this is regulation working this is
when you you go to the store and you buy a
[SPEAKER_02]: product, you know, there's not pesticides
in it and Now that cannabis is legal We're
[SPEAKER_02]: a year or so from having all of that
testing in place so that you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's no bug shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no pesticide There's no mold or
mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just getting delicious concentrate
So it sucks that they're finding it's but
[SPEAKER_01]: it's awesome that they're finding it right
because now we can stop it We can start
[SPEAKER_01]: teaching the growers and the grow
facilities how to stop using these
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Pretty much in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I predict that the Department of
Agriculture is going to create a pesticide
[SPEAKER_01]: class for the cannabis industry They're
gonna have to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna have to happen They're going to
have to make their own regulations because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's who's doing this They're gonna have
to tell us what we can and can't do they
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of are now We're creating all of that
stuff from the ground up like it exists in
[SPEAKER_02]: every other industry But we're not allowed
to access any of the components that do
[SPEAKER_02]: this for like cantaloupe or tobacco or
right beer because cannabis is federally
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal So we're not allowed to federally
test so now we can't find all of the labs
[SPEAKER_02]: that are doing the testing We're created
by the demand the medical industry created
[SPEAKER_02]: here Like all of the labs that are up and
running around the state came from the
[SPEAKER_02]: medical marijuana days and they weren't
state mandated the industry demanded them
[SPEAKER_02]: and Created them on their own and when
they do testing labs want to apply for DEA
[SPEAKER_02]: Licensing like they should they all got
raided pouch and so they stopped applying
[SPEAKER_02]: for DEA Licensing and just ran a testing
lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, we're just without that federal
certification meaning that they can't do
[SPEAKER_02]: like organics testing or certifying or
anything like that because that's all
[SPEAKER_01]: federal right shot at the Steep Hill
Halent labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I don't think organic testing is
actually federal Regulations for using
[SPEAKER_02]: that word are okay that makes sense
Recently if you're a legal marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: business and you had organics in your name
You had to change that we talked about
[SPEAKER_01]: that on the show a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep shot of three rivers What you guys
gonna do alright, so let's talk about this
[SPEAKER_01]: article a little bit you guys It seems to
be a trend in Colorado that a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial grows are using pesticides that
have been banned and That sounds
[SPEAKER_01]: ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: But oftentimes these products were sprayed
on the plants 70 days ago and these rules
[SPEAKER_01]: came into effect 20 days ago, so you can't
retroactively unspray your plants You
[SPEAKER_02]: can't go back and that's basically what
we're seeing plants that were harvested
[SPEAKER_02]: six months ago and turned into Other
earths sold off and turned into other
[SPEAKER_02]: products like edibles and concentrates,
you know I didn't put into four months ago
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't account for the time from so
you've got to grow these plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got a veg They've got to flower
you're looking at 90 to 120 days there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got to be harvested They've got to
be trimmed and dried and cured.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're looking another two weeks there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're what?
[SPEAKER_01]: 140 days ish somewhere between 120 and 150
days by now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's engineer math, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the product has to be picked up
by the Infusion company the MIPS whoever's
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna turn it into something the
processing facility like it I mean then
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got drawing and carrying too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's right That's what that's what
got us to about 150 but like yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're still rolling on almost 200 days 400
or 200 days 250 days between Yeah before
[SPEAKER_02]: it's even processed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, but I mean it wasn't Standard
practice for the company buying the
[SPEAKER_02]: product to lab test it again Right and
that's one of the things that these
[SPEAKER_02]: recalls are starting to create is the
first company to really fail That was the
[SPEAKER_02]: first big policy change.
[SPEAKER_02]: They announced was we're gonna test
everything that comes in now because
[SPEAKER_02]: that's how this happened Yeah,
they processed really nasty stuff And we
[SPEAKER_02]: probably dabbed some of it It could have
happened and you guys a lot of people did
[SPEAKER_02]: none of these Recalls have been issued
because people got sick or anything like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's right industry-wide They're all
voluntary when they're going through and
[SPEAKER_02]: doing lab testing when one of their
products fails They just do a massive
[SPEAKER_02]: recall on anything with that serial number
Which is admirable because that's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: money that these guys are losing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's tons of money tons of money I just
measured money and weight tons of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes dollar amounts and weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these plants could have been sprayed
200 days ago and these rules just were put
[SPEAKER_01]: into effect whenever 30 days ago 45 days
ago And so it's not like people are
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking up on purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like it's ignorance It's just
it's just timing of laws in a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: places something that I want to mention is
All that weed used to smoke back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: day before we had dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was being sprayed with some shit There
was something worse than what's happening
[SPEAKER_01]: in these dispensaries on your weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've smoked it before It's quality
control is one of the first things legal
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana created as a side industry and
it's been a beautiful thing You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw a quality go when medical came real
popular around 2010 quality skyrocketed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a huge competition for quality
buds and then around 2013 2014 the quality
[SPEAKER_01]: started going away and the quantity
started popping up now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything looks the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything looks real similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna try to To make that different at
green and healthy wellness We've got some
[SPEAKER_01]: fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got we got fire genetics and I know how
to grow So I'm gonna try to bring that
[SPEAKER_01]: quality back to the shelf green and
healthy wellness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait to see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I keep looking back at The recording
software to make sure we're getting what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're saying because we can't afford to
try to do this all over again That was
[SPEAKER_01]: weird, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so we're talking a lot about
these tainted products This brings me to
[SPEAKER_01]: an email or an email a news article.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish there was an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would have been great this one Mike
sent this to me from the Denver Post right
[SPEAKER_01]: on Mike for finding us the good news The
headline is Hickenlooper issues executive
[SPEAKER_01]: order to declare tainted pot a threat to
the public the byline is any marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: grown with unapproved pesticides would be
removed from commerce and destroyed once
[SPEAKER_01]: again the articles from David Magoya and
Ricardo Baca and it goes a little bit like
[SPEAKER_01]: this I need to take a drink because I am
dried up and then I'll read you the
[SPEAKER_02]: article Mike say something impressive Okay
Basically this story Just to save Jeff the
[SPEAKER_02]: effort of reading a long letter from the
governor Any marijuana grown with an
[SPEAKER_02]: unapproved pesticide is now a threat to
public safety just sort of by default so
[SPEAKER_02]: any but any grow that's got An unapproved
pesticide use going on in their grow is
[SPEAKER_02]: currently scrambling to figure out new
pest management protocols Because the rule
[SPEAKER_02]: in this that's gonna really throw
shockwaves through the industry is Right
[SPEAKER_02]: now cannabis is federally illegal and to
sell a pesticide in the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a federal certification and
approval And your product has to be tested
[SPEAKER_02]: for all kinds of stuff because it's being
sprayed on guns God knows what around God
[SPEAKER_02]: knows who so it every pesticide comes with
a lot of really specific rules about how
[SPEAKER_02]: they can and can't be used and what they
can and can't be used on and Cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: right now isn't on any of those labels and
What the governor just said was if
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis isn't on the label specifically
you can't use it to grow marijuana Legally
[SPEAKER_01]: in Colorado and nobody's gonna put
marijuana on there or cannabis or they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't just because it's illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah There is a caveat there's some some
pesticides have They're super safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use them on anything and they have
a Standardized phrase for that that'll be
[SPEAKER_02]: on the label and if the pesticide carries
that specific Use designation then it can
[SPEAKER_02]: be used on cannabis So it's not like we
can't use anything in this industry But I
[SPEAKER_02]: guarantee there are countless grows around
Colorado that have been using stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's perfectly acceptable for tobacco or
flowers or food And has been used on
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis for a decade or more around the
country everywhere Just as common practice
[SPEAKER_02]: right there scrambling right now to figure
out what they're gonna replace that
[SPEAKER_01]: product with It's gonna make a huge
difference for a lot of growers So there's
[SPEAKER_01]: a timeline here and I will read part of
the article you guys I might try to sum it
[SPEAKER_01]: up for us, but I'll read a bunch of it
There's a timeline off to the right of the
[SPEAKER_01]: article.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I was thinking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you I needed a little bit of
hydration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that helped out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a timeline here and it says on
September 7th months after marijuana holds
[SPEAKER_01]: post post tests find pesticides and
products and that was on September 7th
[SPEAKER_01]: September 8th Denver recalls Mahatma pot
extracts containing unapproved pesticides
[SPEAKER_01]: and then on the 18th Denver issues two
more recalls and it keeps going Let's see
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado proposes stricter rules pot
products made with unapproved pesticides
[SPEAKER_01]: recalled on October 18th, Colorado puts
What that's not a real word.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just abbreviated Stuff on industry to
use pesticides that are safe on pot And
[SPEAKER_01]: then on the 21st nature's cure of Denver
recalls pot products containing pesticides
[SPEAKER_01]: and it just keeps going you guys So there
are a bunch of incidents of these
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides on cannabis We're gonna keep
seeing it and then I think it'll taper off
[SPEAKER_01]: in the middle of next year It should buy
by summer of next year by spring of next
[SPEAKER_01]: year All this shit should be settled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody should be well educated on what
they can't can't use all the tainted herbs
[SPEAKER_02]: should be gone Some of the problem here is
we don't have enough testing labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you were looking to invest In a fun
size bit side business to call us We'll
[SPEAKER_01]: show you how to set up a testing lab We
want you to be able to test for residual
[SPEAKER_01]: solvents and hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need you to be able to test for
pesticides and flowers We need you to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to test for molds and pathogens in
our flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need E.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coli testing in the buds Yeah,
all we need all the potency testing
[SPEAKER_01]: reliable potency testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's read part of the article
I know Mike tried to sum it up,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it goes like this governor John
Hickenlooper on Thursday issued an
[SPEAKER_01]: executive order telling State agencies
that any marijuana grown with unapproved
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides is a threat to public safety
and should be removed from commerce and
[SPEAKER_01]: destroyed The order is Hickenlooper's
first word on a months-old controversy
[SPEAKER_01]: over pesticide used to grow cannabis And a
more aggressive approach than half the
[SPEAKER_01]: dozen recalls by Denver health officials
have put on thousands of contaminated
[SPEAKER_01]: products Some of it later allowed back
into commerce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry you guys that was hard to read
There's a really long sentence that whole
[SPEAKER_01]: paragraph is one sentence and I didn't
have a good rhythm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made it wonky
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it was the tech issues or
the dabs after but it definitely fucked
[SPEAKER_01]: with my rhythm That's the truth the
article goes on to say the order Effective
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately was the result of a
collaboration with officials from several
[SPEAKER_01]: state agencies the Department of
Agriculture Revenue and Public Health and
[SPEAKER_01]: Environment among them and provides much
needed clarity on the use of pet use of
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides and how agencies should treat
them according To a joint announcement a
[SPEAKER_01]: joint announcement, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Haha Alright, it says when a pesticide is
applied to a crop in a manner that is
[SPEAKER_01]: inconsistent with the pesticides label and
the crop is contaminated by that pesticide
[SPEAKER_01]: it constitutes a threat to public safety
the order says the order says agencies
[SPEAKER_01]: agencies should use all investigative and
enforcement authority to end the threat
[SPEAKER_01]: including but not limited to placing
contaminated marijuana on administrative
[SPEAKER_01]: hold and destroying contaminated marijuana
pursuant to existing law industry
[SPEAKER_01]: Spokepersons Spokespersons God,
my words are hard industry Spokespersons
[SPEAKER_01]: could not be immediately reached for
comment late Thursday The order comes from
[SPEAKER_01]: Denver Post stories that showed how
potentially harmful pesticides barred for
[SPEAKER_01]: use on cannabis were still being applied
and fought at high concentrations in
[SPEAKER_02]: products sold to customers The Denver Post
is taking full credit for this executive
[SPEAKER_02]: order That's what yeah, that's what that
sounded like Thanks for pointing that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Newspapers love it when they can say we
reported something and then change happens
[SPEAKER_02]: And did a state level because of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is a huge feather in their
cap.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've just Been buying up random product
of dispensaries and taking it to testing
[SPEAKER_02]: labs I was gonna say the westward started
that part of it They the westward and the
[SPEAKER_02]: Denver Post both hammered the edibles
industry a couple of years ago over
[SPEAKER_02]: potency issues and then they started doing
contaminants test or the poster to doing
[SPEAKER_02]: contaminants testing and It's definitely
sent shockwaves through the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely caused change at a state
level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So They're running around like they scored
because they fucking scored and they kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of did And it's been a good smack for the
legal industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think like there was a little bit of
shenanigans like we brought a lot of the
[SPEAKER_02]: black market stuff with us and Eventually,
we were gonna step up enough to where we
[SPEAKER_02]: had to play by the same rules everybody
else did and we've passed that point in
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado now significantly and So a lot of
the things that happen at every employee
[SPEAKER_02]: are now gonna be happening throughout the
marijuana industry and some of that's lab
[SPEAKER_02]: testing some of that's recalls and It's
about time it happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll keep going with the article.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says where was I?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to give a shout out to Claude the
candy man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Claude the candy man,
dude You're on an adventure of a lifetime.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably not gonna hear this
podcast but Claude is taking a personal
[SPEAKER_01]: vacation and I've seen his Facebook
pictures The dude has never had a bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: smile He's making a life change and Claude
I'm proud of you bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out support sweet stone candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what made me think Yeah,
he needs a shout out on the show So it
[SPEAKER_01]: goes on to say the post also identified
how state laws that barred the use of
[SPEAKER_01]: certain pesticides were not enforced and
that testing requirements for pesticide
[SPEAKER_01]: residues were set aside and Then it says a
threat to safety Thursday's bulletin
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically mandates state agencies to
determine any off-label use of a
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides a threat to public safety and
ensure that the contaminated products are
[SPEAKER_01]: quarantined and destroyed That's a bunch
of hash and pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just got to watch get just destroyed
I'm wondering how high the animals the
[SPEAKER_01]: landfill gonna end up I think it's gonna
burn it like back in the day But the fire
[SPEAKER_01]: department used to just put all the bales
of weed in the fire They still do that all
[SPEAKER_02]: over the place and every now and then they
fuck it up and get the whole town really
[SPEAKER_02]: high Yeah, but I I don't know maybe I
think it's just gonna get blended with
[SPEAKER_02]: dirt is what it's probably gonna happen
That's what that's kind of what happens at
[SPEAKER_01]: a dispensary if you run a soil grow and
you Got to throw leaves away.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do like lasagna.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do leaves dirt leaves dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just smash it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The article goes on to say Thursday's
bulletin specifically meant no way I just
[SPEAKER_01]: read that part that is that is a stiffer
approach in the quantum Quarantines and
[SPEAKER_01]: recalls Denver health officials have put
on marijuana products contaminated with
[SPEAKER_01]: unapproved pesticides in most cases the
products were allowed back into commerce
[SPEAKER_01]: once test confirmed Pesticide residues
were at levels lower than what's allowed
[SPEAKER_01]: on other consumable crops Hickenlooper's
order appears to leave no room for trace
[SPEAKER_01]: amounts and Recalls for the destruction of
the affected plants and any derivative
[SPEAKER_01]: products zero No trace elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they used any pesticide they find it
on there pretty much bye-bye to your whole
[SPEAKER_02]: product line If they use some of this
stuff, I mean in years ago, they could be
[SPEAKER_02]: destroying breeding stock or I how many
this is most of the recalls are stemmed
[SPEAKER_02]: from a couple of bigger grows that
wholesale off dried flour to other
[SPEAKER_02]: companies To make edibles or hash with and
so that's it's the people that bought it
[SPEAKER_02]: that are now issuing recalls As they go
through and they're like wait fuck we
[SPEAKER_02]: bought 80 pounds of that and we make
chocolate bars So we threw that 80 pounds
[SPEAKER_02]: in with a thousand other pounds we bought
and we made butter out of that and then we
[SPEAKER_02]: made Edibles and now we've got to recall
all the edible batches with those serial
[SPEAKER_02]: numbers on it It's huge ripples to the
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ouch.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna see lab testing at every
level.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna see the labs triple or
quadruple The number across the state to
[SPEAKER_02]: handle all the testing that's gonna have
to take place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Wouldn't be surprised to see a little
spike in price of a buck or two per
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever To help cover all this fucking
cost because yeah, it's gonna play into
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time I'm happy to buy
stuff in the legal industry because I know
[SPEAKER_02]: that It's coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't have to worry about what's
being sprayed on it or what's still in it,
[SPEAKER_01]: man You just made the greatest argument
for legal prostitution Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep that applies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I didn't just study legalizing weed
in college We study legalizing other stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if the hookers are tested and clean
then it's it's better than getting some
[SPEAKER_01]: dirty hookers All right, we we've gotten
sidetracked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna continue with the article here
It goes on to say a company could destroy
[SPEAKER_01]: any affected marijuana voluntarily or face
administrative actions by the state to
[SPEAKER_01]: force the destruction according to a
policy statement issued by the chiefs of
[SPEAKER_01]: the three state agencies involved there is
no pesticide specific specifically
[SPEAKER_01]: approved for use on marijuana because the
chemicals are regulated by the US
[SPEAKER_01]: Environmental Protection Agency and
cannabis is illegal under federal law as a
[SPEAKER_01]: result There have been no tests to show
how pesticides used on marijuana could
[SPEAKER_01]: affect consumers or whether their use is
safe But state agricultural officials have
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed certain pesticides to be used on
marijuana crops Only if it would not
[SPEAKER_01]: violate the restriction on the products
label It is a violation of federal law to
[SPEAKER_01]: use a pesticide contrary to its label
because this applies to you and your
[SPEAKER_01]: homegrown Supplies to you and your
greenhouse grow any pesticide wants to be
[SPEAKER_02]: a dick.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be an extra charge Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you got to do when you buy your your
spray products your Pesticides peel off
[SPEAKER_01]: that little booklet that's on the back and
read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be rules on there There will be
what you should really pay attention to is
[SPEAKER_01]: the interval of reentry If it says not to
go in this sprayed area for four hours You
[SPEAKER_01]: should probably stay out of there for four
hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take take that seriously You're not gonna
notice that you're getting sick from a
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticide until you start twitching in
five years Right, like you really want to
[SPEAKER_02]: read those labels.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where the heck was I?
[SPEAKER_01]: Despite the prohibitions the post revealed
in its own testing that a number of
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana infused products contained high
levels of pesticides not allowed for use
[SPEAKER_01]: on cannabis What followed were a number of
recalls issued by the Denver Department of
[SPEAKER_01]: Environmental Health after investigations
into businesses connected with the post's
[SPEAKER_01]: findings We're at the last paragraph you
guys go ahead Mike you had something to
[SPEAKER_02]: say they downplay the other half of their
findings they found they tested Eight
[SPEAKER_02]: samples two of them came back pretty
dirty, but the other six came back Cleaner
[SPEAKER_02]: than the lab testing dude had seen
anything in a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but that's not news Well, it should be
it should be but um, there's no scare
[SPEAKER_01]: tactic involved in that right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's it's really unfortunate that
there's dirty product out on store shelves
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time it's all being
recalled because we've got testing labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one else has It's kind of a beautiful
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm such a fucked up way though All right,
you guys I will try I'm gonna make myself
[SPEAKER_01]: a note a list of Approved all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to find a list of approved
pesticides, which I need anyway for the
[SPEAKER_01]: shop We just see we use basically one or
two products at the shop We've got a
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty good pesticide regiment going on
there, but uh, I will get a list of
[SPEAKER_01]: approved pesticides We'll talk about that
on the show when we do the pest management
[SPEAKER_01]: episode that I need to work on I've got a
lot of episodes are like halfway written
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys I just need to put them together
things have been really chaotic in my
[SPEAKER_01]: world I've been driving to Springs like
three times a week to talk about getting a
[SPEAKER_01]: job and now I've got the job So it's gonna
be a lot of fun Let's get on to the last
[SPEAKER_01]: paragraph of this news article so that we
can get Mike home to his little baby It
[SPEAKER_01]: says although state officials had been
battling around pesticide rules for more
[SPEAKER_01]: than a year There was no enforcement until
Denver health officials quarantined more
[SPEAKER_01]: than a hundred thousand plants It said
were improperly grown with pesticides the
[SPEAKER_01]: state said could not be used The
quarantines came after Denver fire
[SPEAKER_01]: inspectors found potentially hazardous
pesticides And marijuana growing
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities during routine inspections this
year and reported it to health officials
[SPEAKER_01]: because I mentioned this on the show They
found a Eagle 20 in there and when Eagle
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 is it Eagle 20 or floor might it's
Eagle 20 When Eagle 20 catches on fire and
[SPEAKER_01]: burns the off gas that comes from Eagle 20
is cyanide So that's why the fire fire
[SPEAKER_01]: department doesn't want that in your grow
Because when it catches on fire,
[SPEAKER_02]: they really read the fucking label people
Yeah, like know what you've got in your
[SPEAKER_02]: grow know what you've got in your house
This is all going into your lungs Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: you should read the label on any product
you're using anyway all the time You
[SPEAKER_01]: should kind of be aware of what you're
putting into yourself and your plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: your food feeding your dog Read the label.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right last paragraph you guys last
small sentence in the paragraph The state
[SPEAKER_01]: is amid rulemaking that would strictly
limit the pesticides that can be used on
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana only to those whose labels allow
for Unspecified crops that can be used in
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses and that are not prohibited
from human consumption Pesticides allowed
[SPEAKER_01]: in tobacco cultivation Also would be
approved.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so Any pesticides found in any
tested cannabis equals your cannabis is
[SPEAKER_01]: now being destroyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep That's a huge move.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your Mike said it a minute ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna make prices go up I mean,
it's gonna send big ripples through the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry There's not everybody was growing
with the stuff that's being banned or was
[SPEAKER_02]: banned a couple months back So it's not
like everyone has to change up but every
[SPEAKER_02]: company That buys product does like it's
it's only a matter of time before shops
[SPEAKER_02]: our lab testing everything that comes in
Just as a matter of policy Let alone
[SPEAKER_02]: extract companies edible companies Just
think of a product like Chiba chew or
[SPEAKER_02]: Dixie like thinking of the new Snoop Dogg
And how much stuff they buy and process
[SPEAKER_02]: right or snoops new line or Rihanna's new
line.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like this fucking every on his new line
Yep, what did I that might have just been
[SPEAKER_02]: a meme on Facebook?

news.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but Willie No, Willie's got a brand

most low right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, they're uh They're that
fucking dispensary that got or is accused
[SPEAKER_02]: of handing out fucking potent edibles at
the goddamn state fair They just keep
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking up left and right so they also had
a lot of pesticide issues In the past,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I'm curious to see if snoops
products have residual pesticides from
[SPEAKER_01]: when they were made back in the day Who
knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Wow, yes You did that and since we're
talking about like celebrities and things
[SPEAKER_01]: that are gonna have strains coming out
Let's go ahead and toot some irie genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: horns here Over the past two nights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been Harvesting the lovely damsels
dank and I actually got harvested a few
[SPEAKER_01]: nights ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was finally dry enough to have finished
Do the final trim so damsels dank you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: is jarred up and the curing process has
begun There will be a tasting party the
[SPEAKER_01]: first weekend of December.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a private party I would invite you
but uh, I can't have all you guys showing
[SPEAKER_01]: up so it's taken Yeah, all the seats are
full you guys, but I will let you know how
[SPEAKER_01]: it goes I'll try to get damsel on the show
shortly after that so that she can talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about her new strain that I made for I
Can't wait till this process is over so I
[SPEAKER_02]: can Finally get some details because all
I've seen is three jar samples flash in
[SPEAKER_01]: front of my nose really tonight Instagram
pictures and some jar samples is pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: much what I've what I've shown anybody,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to dig through all of those
jars and there's a whole bunch of them
[SPEAKER_01]: over there There are 10 that made it to
the final round for damsel to choose from
[SPEAKER_01]: so whichever one of those 10 She likes the
best we will work with She's human and she
[SPEAKER_01]: may reject all 10 of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That may not be what she wants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this might just be round one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that's the case, then I just did a
really cool fino hunt and I found at least
[SPEAKER_01]: three keepers out of that shit,

[SPEAKER_02]: I'll come right up I've been getting a lot
of feedback on that lately shit's been
[SPEAKER_02]: blowing up lately because Anti-pop people
have taken notice and are starting to get
[SPEAKER_02]: really pissed when I link their stuff and
debunk it And it's led to some really
[SPEAKER_02]: hilarious little prohibitionist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know Attempted trolling I suppose
is a good way to describe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's funny because it's sort of like
if a small child decided to lecture
[SPEAKER_02]: calculus At you like it doesn't matter how
passionate they are like they're never
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna get it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not gonna learn anything useful
It's just this weird thing that I mean to
[SPEAKER_02]: be against pot at this point in history is
to have failed to do your homework and
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just where the argument starts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah poor Randy poor Randy Randy I slayed
you so much so much passion so little
[SPEAKER_01]: information You're a poor little troll
Randy and I done slayed you so many times
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just keep coming back for more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need someone who likes to make memes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have time to do this shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Dude, I need somebody to help me reply
meme We have got trolls on this podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: that listen religiously So you need a meme
you call them to action and we will get
[SPEAKER_01]: you some memes, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the anti-pop Community learned a
meme like a week ago and it's stuff that
[SPEAKER_02]: makes you want to put your head through a
wall You guys are gonna have to follow
[SPEAKER_01]: like so that you can help them with the
meme more Yep, I just don't have the
[SPEAKER_02]: energy all the time to fucking debunk
nonsense because there's a lot of nonsense
[SPEAKER_01]: This is we're way off topic you guys but I
hashtag I like it when you ramble and I
[SPEAKER_01]: hope you guys are listening still Shout
out if you are we're a rambling Facebook
[SPEAKER_01]: has murdered me over the past week with
all of the change your Profile picture to
[SPEAKER_01]: a French flag and all of this and
everybody talking about who's a terrorist
[SPEAKER_01]: and who is not that has burnt me the shit
out dude I can't even look at Facebook the
[SPEAKER_01]: past week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find myself shunning news and stuff
Social media after events like this just
[SPEAKER_02]: because of all that Like the event itself
is bad enough all the hate in the fear and
[SPEAKER_02]: the idiocy and the ignorance that led up
to it's bad enough But then the shit that
[SPEAKER_02]: comes after is just so much worse,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Yeah, Facebook just makes me want to
smash my head into the wall lately So I've
[SPEAKER_01]: been avoiding that sorry if I haven't been
returning your Facebook messages and all
[SPEAKER_01]: that stuff for the past week you guys But
once all this stuff stops on Facebook once
[SPEAKER_01]: we go back to talking about football games
and stupid shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be back Yeah It's a little too
intense right now I have to go unfriend
[SPEAKER_01]: people because of some of the shit that I
see I'm not gonna tolerate some of it Like
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not gonna get all political and get my
opinion going too much on here This is
[SPEAKER_01]: weed podcast, but god damn some people get
Really really ridiculous really really
[SPEAKER_02]: quickly when people are afraid they do
really really crazy insane things and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what's going on right now is
There's a lot of fear out there and people
[SPEAKER_02]: are just diving into it because it's easy
There is a lot of fear you guys don't buy
[SPEAKER_01]: into the fear find the truth Yep,
I know that's hard to do in the world
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of clouds plus the We're
blowing but you got to try to find the
[SPEAKER_01]: truth search for the truth.
