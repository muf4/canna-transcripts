[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start this podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking today
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been taking dabs of TKD number 10
live batter This is a blend of chem D and
[SPEAKER_00]: triangle Kush on the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is described as sour petrol and
lemon I think I agree with that But I also
[SPEAKER_00]: would add a hint of mothballs that doesn't
sound pleasant But the Kush and mothballs
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor is very delicious to a Kush Kush
consumer a Kush connoisseur I think it is
[SPEAKER_00]: delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to the TKD number 10 Live

[SPEAKER_00]: genetics dot-com Also, while I'm on that
subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are still updating the strain pages the
genetics info the genetics district
[SPEAKER_00]: descriptions There is a lot of stuff to
build when it comes to updating and
[SPEAKER_00]: building a website Especially when you're
a breeder that has made many many strains
[SPEAKER_00]: countless strains I'm sure they're
countable, but I haven't bothered to count
[SPEAKER_00]: them There are so many that I have lost
track lost count of how many strains I've
[SPEAKER_00]: invented and created and crossed and named
and whatever you want to call it We are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing our best to get all of those
descriptions and photos on the website.

[SPEAKER_00]: Alright that covers all of the business
portion of the show Let's get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: patreon question part of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Can we use their name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it comes from Riley and the message
goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says hey Rasta Jeff My name is Riley.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feel free to use my name that makes it
nice and easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, Riley?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say I have a crop which I'm
about to harvest and I have spider mites
[SPEAKER_00]: in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah That's that's a bummer, but there is a
way to beat this There's a way to solve
[SPEAKER_00]: this problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, what you really need to do is
cure the problem and then solve the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem So you don't have mites in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole nother rant But let's talk
about the current crop because that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're focused on it says I've been able
to keep them at bay Using dr. Zines so
[SPEAKER_00]: they have not webbed Man, you've really
got them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're worried about them webbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually you just see a little bit of
pistilling and marking They're in there
[SPEAKER_00]: thick if you're concerned with webs goes
on to say but I'm curious if you have any
[SPEAKER_00]: advice As to how I can save my buds and
get them in the best shape during and
[SPEAKER_00]: after harvest I'm not sure how long the
mites will continue to live off of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant once it is chopped But I really
don't want these buds to be covered in
[SPEAKER_00]: webs and become useless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is a very reasonable hope a
reasonable want You spend a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: growing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is almost harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've gone at least 12 or 13 weeks It's
time to chop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want them to become useless.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wraps up with I love the show and I
appreciate all that you do Thanks from
[SPEAKER_00]: Riley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening Riley.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your message and I appreciate
you for watching and listening now Let's
[SPEAKER_00]: talk a little bit about harvesting a crop
that is infested with spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like a nightmare It sounds like
everything should be over.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are gonna say kill it with
fire I come from a commercial cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: environment where kill it With fire means
that you just burnt down your job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's got to be a resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's got to be a solution Here is the
best solution I can come up with for you
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier in the episode not in this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me say that better in a previous
episode I talked about some products
[SPEAKER_00]: called zero tall and hydrogen peroxide I
do not like to spray things on my plants
[SPEAKER_00]: while they are in flower But if you want
to rinse off those spider mites if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to rinse off those webs if you want
to rinse off the spider mite poop you can
[SPEAKER_00]: use hydrogen peroxide or Zero tall at
somewhere between 50 and 30 milliliters
[SPEAKER_00]: per gallon of water and just hose those
plants right off It'll knock the mites
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll knock the eggs right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll dissolve any eggs that are left on
there It will kind of mitigate your
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll definitely get rid of the webbing
You can also spray just plain water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get in there hit them with clean
water People are gonna say don't get your
[SPEAKER_00]: big chunky buds wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not gonna hose them down We're not
spraying them super heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just gonna miss them and knock off
those bugs You just want to kind of hose
[SPEAKER_00]: them down a little bit Don't drench them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't saturate the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of spongy Don't get in there
and do that Spray them the bubbles are
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna knock off the water in the bubbles
and the impact are gonna knock off the
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs Then you can let them dry and they
will be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not saturate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, don't saturate them Don't over spray
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knock off the bugs You can use a zero
tall or hydrogen peroxide spray or you can
[SPEAKER_00]: hit it with just straight water Spray them
off then defoliate get rid of all those
[SPEAKER_00]: big leaves before you even harvest cut all
those big leaves off get them out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: room you are Minimizing the presence of
spider mites webs and eggs at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have hosed them down Don't go
soaking them until they are super
[SPEAKER_00]: saturated you guys and they get rained on
Okay, they're gonna be okay because they
[SPEAKER_00]: get rained on outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's naturally how it would happen Make
sure you've got some airflow be
[SPEAKER_00]: preventative use your brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get too much humidity in there Don't
create a big humidity spike and cause a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem right at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can spray them lightly You can hose
them down put it on a high pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't use a lot of water This will work
then then what we're gonna do we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliate We're gonna clean them up the
best we can before you go into any other
[SPEAKER_00]: grow space change clothes clean yourself
up Sanitize, but let's stay focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: this part.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to clean up these plants Then
let's cut them down when you cut them down
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend cutting the whole plant
down in one big move right it where the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is coming out of the dirt Say my
MacBook here is the dirt right where the
[SPEAKER_00]: stock is coming out You want to cut it
right at the dirt now?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just got that long branch then hang
it upside down that branch that is
[SPEAKER_00]: sticking up is going to expose a nice
moist Wound it's like you just took it you
[SPEAKER_00]: literally just took scissors and cut that
plant open Those spider mites are after
[SPEAKER_00]: the juices inside of your leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they're eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're biting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're penetrating the leaf They're
getting the juices and they're draining
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant of its life juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We just did we just opened up the life
juice buffet at the end of that stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is open It's flowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically plant blood oozing out of
there If that was a human that it happened
[SPEAKER_00]: to they need major medical attention So
we're gonna hang the plant upside down as
[SPEAKER_00]: soon as We cut it now Here's what's gonna
happen most of those spider mites that are
[SPEAKER_00]: present are going to scramble right up to
the top of those buds They're just gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I want to burn the top of those
plants They're gonna go upward spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mites have a natural instinct to go upward
They want to get to the top of the bud so
[SPEAKER_00]: that the wind will catch them They can
start making a web on this bud The wind
[SPEAKER_00]: will blow them over to this bud and that's
how they start making their webs Then the
[SPEAKER_00]: wind will come again and blow them over
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a little trapeze of webs going
on They make the little webbing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is their goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they want to go up to The top also they
smell that yummy fresh cut that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like fucking sharks in the water
They're like I smell it and they start
[SPEAKER_00]: running up to the tip of that stick They
all will congregate right there at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of that stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all gonna gather right at the top
You've got a couple of options and these
[SPEAKER_00]: are gonna sound like crazy options your
first option Leave some of that stick when
[SPEAKER_00]: you cut them down the reason I told you to
make that stick long now We can just cut
[SPEAKER_00]: some of it off cut two or three inches of
that stick off and throw it away Burn it
[SPEAKER_00]: with fire get it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where all the spider mites have
congregated You just made a motel up there
[SPEAKER_00]: cut the hotel off remove it Repeat that
process a couple of times and you'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the mites up there to the top when
you cut it You made a fresh new cut more
[SPEAKER_00]: plant juices are exposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those bugs are gonna keep running on up
there Here is another crazy idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it Mike has done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen it in action Shout out to Ernie
Ernie still does it here is a way to get
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of those spider mites that have
climbed at the top Take the dab torch to
[SPEAKER_00]: work and just fucking hit them with the
dab torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't burn down the building there in your
personal life They're not in the the
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial grow I said take it to work
take it in there in your personal grow
[SPEAKER_00]: wherever they're hanging put the dab torch
on and just fucking put those fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for that those fucking spider
mites and spider might eggs will be gone
[SPEAKER_00]: in no time It's gonna stink like shit in
there, but it's better than having spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mites in your fresh cut buds So defoliate
a spray defoliate chop them down Hang them
[SPEAKER_00]: upside down and watch those spider mites
run up to the top as they run up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: top get rid of them with their other
either I think that's what I'm going for
[SPEAKER_00]: either with fire or by cutting that tip
off of there and removing that from the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow now There is one more thing we can
think about if your buds are covered in
[SPEAKER_00]: spider mites If your buds have got my eggs
and might shit on them and it is visible
[SPEAKER_00]: if you can see the spider mites running
around You may consider a drench.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned spraying the plants with
hydrogen peroxide or zero tall What is to
[SPEAKER_00]: stopping what is stopping you from cutting
those plants into smaller pieces and
[SPEAKER_00]: dunking them before we hang them up so we
can cut Them down cut them into a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit smaller pieces dunk them in a hydrogen
peroxide or zero tall solution and that
[SPEAKER_00]: will wash off all those bugs all the mites
all the spider might shit and then you can
[SPEAKER_00]: hang them up and they will dry and if
there are any bugs left those bugs will
[SPEAKER_00]: still run up to the top and you still get
to burn them with the torch because that
[SPEAKER_00]: does sound like a lot of fun, so one of
your options is to Defoliate spray them
[SPEAKER_00]: cut them down right after you cut them
down while they are still juicy and wet
[SPEAKER_00]: get a five gallon bucket fill it with
water and put 15 to 30 milliliters of 30%
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen peroxide or zero tall in there
and just Put them in there and swirl the
[SPEAKER_00]: shit out of it then take it out and hang
them up in an area That is well
[SPEAKER_00]: ventilated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to fan right on the buds
You want them to drip dry and dry slowly
[SPEAKER_00]: normally like they would but that is an
option to help you get rid of your spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mites and your spider mite eggs and
Possibly spider mite webbing that are in
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to just drench them shake
them in there dunk them Shake them around
[SPEAKER_00]: in there pull them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them hang dry naturally Don't keep it
too wet or too moist in that room get that
[SPEAKER_00]: room about 40 to 60 percent relative
humidity about 60 65 degrees and
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature would be good That'll help
your plants dry up fairly quickly without
[SPEAKER_00]: drying them too quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get rid of that excess water You
will prevent any mold issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so your options I think your
options are to spray them start getting
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of the bugs Defoliate that will get a
lot of the bugs gone chop them down
[SPEAKER_00]: Consider if you want to cut them into
smaller pieces and dunk them then hang
[SPEAKER_00]: them or if you want to hang the whole
plant Then watch the bugs move to the tips
[SPEAKER_00]: get rid of the tips Spray it with burn it
with fire or cut the tips off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are probably your best options
Alright Riley.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I helped you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got any follow-up questions,
I would love to hear from you You know how
[SPEAKER_00]: to reach me grow from your heart at
hotmail.com Alright, let's keep the show
[SPEAKER_00]: moving and get right into the next episode
This one comes from a person who calls
[SPEAKER_00]: themself their name Is Casey and their
message goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says hi Jeff I learned about your
podcast via the grow cast a big shout out
[SPEAKER_00]: to Jordan and the whole grow cast family
Big respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everybody's doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say I've been really
enjoying your grow advice and other
[SPEAKER_00]: content Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad my grow advice is working for you
and I'm glad you're following my other
[SPEAKER_00]: content I wonder if that is the Instagram
live or what else you're watching,
[SPEAKER_00]: but thank you I hope it is working for you
it goes on to say you said feel free to
[SPEAKER_00]: email you with a Question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've purchased regular seeds for the first
time and I'm trying to figure out how and
[SPEAKER_00]: when to cull my males Alright,
so a lot of people go with feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they are afraid to get regular
seeds because they know they've got to get
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of those males it sounds like our
friend Casey here has taken the plunge and
[SPEAKER_00]: now they are concerned as As to when to
pull the males out and how to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: them So it goes on to say I'm growing in a
single four by four tent Which I use for
[SPEAKER_00]: both veg and flour so that limits our
options Then it says I prefer the Scrog
[SPEAKER_00]: method for plant training.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I already see where the problem
is gonna arise here However, I typically
[SPEAKER_00]: begin strong Scrogging during the mid veg
stage and I'm assuming I won't be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify the sex until very late in veg or
early flower I obviously don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: Scrog all of my plants and then try to
untangle and remove a bunch of males After
[SPEAKER_00]: they have grown into the Scrog netting any
advice you can provide on how to best
[SPEAKER_00]: resolve this issue would be greatly
appreciated Thanks for the great work You
[SPEAKER_00]: do from Casey.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Casey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some advice for you But first
let's talk a little bit about Scrogging to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure everybody following along is
keeping up So when we Scrog a plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: means screen of green SC ROG is short for
screen of green We're going to put a
[SPEAKER_00]: screen above the canopy of the plants as
the plants grow into that screen Instead
[SPEAKER_00]: of letting them grow up into the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We bend them toward they go horizontal now
instead of my arm going straight up we put
[SPEAKER_00]: some Netting here and we've just
manipulated the branch under the netting
[SPEAKER_00]: to where it turns at a 90 degree or a
shorter angle And then instead of going
[SPEAKER_00]: straight up into the light We can fill
this horizontal space with bud space with
[SPEAKER_00]: branching and then let it grow from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll grow up So you make the branches
bend and the shoots start growing up out
[SPEAKER_00]: of it You can get a lot more space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a lot more buds per space You
don't need to use a bunch of sticks to
[SPEAKER_00]: support everything So that is Scrogging
and what the purpose of Scrogging is but
[SPEAKER_00]: it's got to be done before flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be done Generally,
it should be done mid veg late veg
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by the time you're in flower It is too
late to Scrog.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to be bending and
manipulating the plants at that point
[SPEAKER_00]: You're letting them focus on flowering So
our friend here has got some regular seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and they want to put them in their tent
But they obviously don't want to work them
[SPEAKER_00]: into a Scrog net because once they
identify the males in flower They've got
[SPEAKER_00]: to cut them out and the point of the Scrog
is to fill that grow space and if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting shit out You've just defeated the
entire purpose of the Scrog.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friend Casey Is on the exact right
path.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I identify the male plants in my
grow before I put this Scrog net up?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a few options for Sexing your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, you have only got one space
which highly minimizes our options If
[SPEAKER_00]: you've only got one space here is what I
think I would do I would start all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds you wish to grow keep in mind that
about 40 to 60 percent of them will be
[SPEAKER_00]: males and will be removed So if you want
to grow five plants plant ten or twelve if
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to grow ten plant 20 or 24 ish
And then when it comes time to get down to
[SPEAKER_00]: the number that fit in there pick your
favorites Hopefully you didn't lose too
[SPEAKER_00]: many males, but if you've got one or two
extras, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Call them and just use your favorite
plants You don't have to use all of them
[SPEAKER_00]: pick your favorite plants out of there So
pick the appropriate amount of seeds which
[SPEAKER_00]: you choose to germinate germinate those
seeds get them growing Get them and tell
[SPEAKER_00]: they're about I don't know six seven
inches tall I guess that's about six or
[SPEAKER_00]: seven inches tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want just a couple of sets of leaves
on there Maybe a couple of nodes growing
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want a whole lot of growth on
these plants Then since they're a little
[SPEAKER_00]: tiny plants and you've only got one space
what we're going to do is put them into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower What I know we're gonna put them
into flower for about ten to twelve days
[SPEAKER_00]: About nine ten eleven or twelve days into
this flowering process.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are going to show you their
sex They'll show you if they're male or
[SPEAKER_00]: female they're going to show you just
little little Hairs growing out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to call them hairs But
that's what you're gonna see just little
[SPEAKER_00]: hairs giving you a peace sign or you're
gonna see little nubs Those little nubs
[SPEAKER_00]: will start to become balls, which will
show you it's a male plant So about nine
[SPEAKER_00]: ten usually by day 14 We can certainly
tell if we've got male or female plants as
[SPEAKER_00]: soon as we identified the males and
females Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to do next pull all the males out
of there and then put the plants back on
[SPEAKER_00]: an 18 6 or 24 hour light cycle This will
put the plants back into veg They will go
[SPEAKER_00]: back into a vegetative stage and they will
continue growing and getting bigger and
[SPEAKER_00]: ready for the flowering cycle while
they're doing this if You don't go too far
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very easy to revert them Just put
your light back on 18 6 or 24 hours and
[SPEAKER_00]: they will revert if you waited too long
It'll take longer if you identify sex
[SPEAKER_00]: early, it won't take as long So just wait
until you've identified sex on every plant
[SPEAKER_00]: as soon as you've pulled out all the boys
put it back on 18 6 or 24 hours and they
[SPEAKER_00]: will Begin vegging again then pot them
into their next big pots veg them up get
[SPEAKER_00]: them in the Scrog run them business as
usual You've got all the boys out of
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just running females.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other ways to do this But since
you've only got one space, you're very
[SPEAKER_00]: very limited on your options something I
would think about is getting either a
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning space or another very small
vegging space because What if in this pack
[SPEAKER_00]: of seeds you find the most amazing plant
you have ever grown?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if you find the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: That cures whatever ails you if you've got
ADD or COPD or HIV or OPP or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got What if this cures it and
you've only got one good run with it
[SPEAKER_00]: because you don't take clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be great medicine It'll be
enjoyable, but you're always gonna say man
[SPEAKER_00]: I really wish I had a clone of that one
strain that got away from me because I
[SPEAKER_00]: never kept a clone of it So I think the
first run with the pack of seeds is kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of an audition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's we do a phenol hunt Every seed is
going to show a little bit of variation
[SPEAKER_00]: depending On the breeding how far and
filial generations that seed line is we're
[SPEAKER_00]: likely going to see Generation from seed
to seed to seed if you plant ten seeds you
[SPEAKER_00]: get five males you pull those you got five
females You're gonna see a female that
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like the mom plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna see a female that looks like
the dad plant You're gonna see a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that is 50 50 both genetics in the middle
Then you're gonna see some outliers some
[SPEAKER_00]: weirdos that are the rest of your genetics
So it is really you're gonna really wish
[SPEAKER_00]: that you had a clone because that first
run is just an audition Running run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want the one that looks like mommy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want the one that looks like daddy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want that 50 50 or did you find a
weirdo that is fucking perfect for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would have thrown it away So I would
really consider getting a veg space or a
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary space so that you can find that
plant that works the best for you and
[SPEAKER_00]: Continue to run it over and over again
Then what will happen is you'll have
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine that works very well for you and
you'll develop a relationship with that
[SPEAKER_00]: one cultivar We can kick ass with our
first grow with the plant I've got a good
[SPEAKER_00]: idea how to grow any plant Pretty decently
but after the second third or fourth time
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow a plant you can definitely tell the
quality of the finished product I know
[SPEAKER_00]: that around week six that plant's gonna
start yellowing up because I didn't give
[SPEAKER_00]: it enough Nitrogen or I know that around a
week five.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna want a lot more calm egg I know
that I shouldn't let it get that cold you
[SPEAKER_00]: start learning things It's like dating the
plant on that first date You have no idea
[SPEAKER_00]: what to expect and that's kind of what
you're doing when you're growing from seed
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to find out is it even a female
that's that's how the first date Goes then
[SPEAKER_00]: that second and third date that's when you
actually start making progress So I would
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend you get yourself a clone space
or a veg space and start keeping clones
[SPEAKER_00]: and doing a phenol hunt that way I
understand that that may not be possible
[SPEAKER_00]: or Feasible or viable for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's got their own conditions and
environments and situations But what if
[SPEAKER_00]: you grow the most amazing cannabis you've
ever grown and you don't have a clone of
[SPEAKER_00]: it If you had another space what I would
recommend is that you grow the plants out
[SPEAKER_00]: on till they're big enough to get one good
clone from I take the top right out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant make a clone of that then I put
those clones in either a clone dome or a
[SPEAKER_00]: machine and Immediately put them under
1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will root while they're under 1212
They're rooting and telling you if they're
[SPEAKER_00]: a male or a female at the same time Again,
these clones are going to tell you in 9 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 14 days if they are males or females Then
we can call the male plant and we can call
[SPEAKER_00]: the male clone now We've only got females
to work with we can run the females now
[SPEAKER_00]: also We've got a female backup so that if
we do find that magic plant In the mix
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another copy of it We don't have
to throw it away and talk about that one
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that got away was sit around and go
Hey, do you have any more of that one Kush
[SPEAKER_00]: that was amazing?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't because I didn't take any
fucking clones of it and everybody will be
[SPEAKER_00]: upset with you even yourself So I
recommend another space and some clones
[SPEAKER_00]: that way you can do a proper phenol hunt
That way you can dial in the medicine You
[SPEAKER_00]: can find the cultivar that works the best
for yourself your condition your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe your customers I'm not sure what
you're doing then you can have a clone and
[SPEAKER_00]: provide that all the time then you can
really Dial it in keep growing it learn it
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect it make it the strain you are
known for Set yourself apart from the
[SPEAKER_00]: market if it's a profitable grow or make
yourself the best medicine you could
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly Consume I want to make sure I
didn't skip any notes here because when I
[SPEAKER_00]: realized you only had one space I did have
to Change my idea on on how to help you
[SPEAKER_00]: out because with one space you can't do a
lot of things There is lab testing to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you if your plants are males or females
You can grow them up to the way they've to
[SPEAKER_00]: where they've got two or three Sets of
leaves you can rub some tissue sample onto
[SPEAKER_00]: a little card and mail that to a
laboratory And they will tell you which
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are males and females as long as
you mark plant A and plant A on the card
[SPEAKER_00]: and on the plant and plant B and plant B
and on the card and on the plant They will
[SPEAKER_00]: reliably tell you if you have got male or
female plants That's very helpful because
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand you don't want to scrog these
plants you definitely I would not put them
[SPEAKER_00]: in the scrog Don't do that find out if
they're males or females first if you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: are out there wondering if you've got male
or female plants There are lab tests
[SPEAKER_00]: available that will tell you way early You
don't have to waste all the time space
[SPEAKER_00]: energy money nutrients all of the things
that come with the grow Let me make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got everything else covered Don't
scrog them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've only got one space So your option
is probably again that option is probably
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow them put them into flower for nine
to fourteen days Pull out the males as
[SPEAKER_00]: soon as you have identified the males put
them back into veg then business as usual
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll take them a little bit to get back
to their veg state, but They'll just start
[SPEAKER_00]: growing they'll get big they'll get robust
They'll get beefy then you scrog them out
[SPEAKER_00]: then you flower just like you did all of
your other crops But again, I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: repeat myself I really encourage you to
get that second space because what if you
[SPEAKER_00]: find what if you find chem dog in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if you find golden goat in there
golden goat was an accident chem dog came
[SPEAKER_00]: from Bag seed who knows what you've got in
there You may find the next gem that could
[SPEAKER_00]: be the hottest shit on the planet and you
don't have an opportunity to take a clone
[SPEAKER_00]: of it That's what we'll be learning How to
revege and you'll be listening to the
[SPEAKER_00]: revege episode again Alright, I want to
