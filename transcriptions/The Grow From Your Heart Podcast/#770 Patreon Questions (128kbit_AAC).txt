[SPEAKER_00]: If you are watching on the YouTube video,
which I do highly encourage, you may have
[SPEAKER_00]: noticed I'm rocking one of the brand new
iReGenetics logo t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, I put the cross logo,
the red golden green cross logo on a black

[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I will be taking pre-orders for

[SPEAKER_00]: probably by the time this episode comes
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be pre-orders available on the
same website to get your hoodies for the
[SPEAKER_00]: winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's not waste too much time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into the main topic of today's
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the top of the show, I did say that I
was going to focus on Patreon questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, I posted to Patreon that I was
going to eat too many edibles and do a
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon only episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I answered non-grow questions,
maybe grow questions about myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: about my personal life, maybe the music
I'm into, maybe some of my past or my
[SPEAKER_00]: history.
[SPEAKER_00]: I opened it up so that the patrons can ask
any questions they felt comfortable
[SPEAKER_00]: asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I don't want to do is do a
Patreon episode where I answer a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: great grow questions and leave people out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want that knowledge free and available
to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I do Patreon bonus content,
it is going to be non-grow related
[SPEAKER_00]: content, kind of fun content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of ways to just hang out with the
crowd and give them extra content that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't exclude growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you get my point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did ask for questions that were not
grow related, and I did say I was going to
[SPEAKER_00]: eat a bunch of edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allegedly, possibly, I may have eaten
those edibles before this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do this normal show,
see how long it takes those to kick in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we will take a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, of course, we will shift to the
Patreon only format.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's jump into this first question
here while things start doing their magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one goes a little bit, maybe a lot
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Yo Rasta Jeff, and it comes from
my friend Gruesome Green on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up to Gruesome Green on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Rasta Jeff, would you ever
consider being a sponsor for a band?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a really good ironic timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saturday night, I'm recording on,
what's the date right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have to be specific?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm recording on September 28th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saturday night, I got to go see the lovely
Natalie Rise perform at a club here in my
[SPEAKER_00]: hometown.
[SPEAKER_00]: She played at Brews Ale House in Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to take the lovely Miss Irie with
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also know her as Dread Vibes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also know her as Zara.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is Miss Irie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took her with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to go see Natalie Rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Minori opened the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a wonderful, an amazing concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natalie Rise did a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Minori did a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the rhythm section in Natalie
Rise's band.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my point is, what you asked about is
sponsor the band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ironically, we worked out a sponsorship
deal with that band.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next leg of the Natalie Rise tour
will be brought to you by Irie Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't talk too much about what that does
include, but I am sponsoring that band.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are not the first reggae band
which I have sponsored.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have contributed funding to tours and
recording, mixing and mastering for other
[SPEAKER_00]: reggae bands that I'm not sure if they
want me to say who they are or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can say that I've done some work with
Jamiri Morgan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can maybe hint and lead on that
there may be a strain being put together
[SPEAKER_00]: for Jamiri Morgan with his flavor profile
and some things that he selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe doing some stuff for our friend
Jamiri which may be released here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also allegedly may be working on something
with Miss Natalie Rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, would I consider being
a sponsor for a band?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I love sponsoring bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was younger, and we're going to
talk about this more in these episodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: these personal Rasta Jeff episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was younger, my original dream was
to be a rock star.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got drums for my 14th birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been playing nonstop since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never give it a rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never quit thinking about polyrhythms
and paradiddles and 16th note triplets and
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 eight time and just weird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always thinking about the drums,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I was younger, my dream was to
travel and be a musician.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to do it on a small level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: If success is traveling around and having
fun with your friends and just partying
[SPEAKER_00]: real hard, we did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really go anywhere with the
opportunity that I had because I was young
[SPEAKER_00]: and I kind of squandered that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my dream was to play music.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I would have had somebody like myself
to say, hey, here's funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's gas money for the next part of the
tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's money for drumheads, guitar
strings, and most importantly,
[SPEAKER_00]: food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of times on the road,
we were hungry, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bands would promise you money,
gas money, gig money, hotel room,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you would get there and you'd have to
sleep in the van and eat peanut butter and
[SPEAKER_00]: jelly sandwiches.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't change any of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Ben, that did suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I would have had somebody back in the
day to fund my tour, I may have been more
[SPEAKER_00]: successful in the music industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the music industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The artists that I promote and endorse and
support and sponsor, I love their music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love their vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love what they're about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it feels good doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get to go see my favorite reggae
bands because I helped contribute to their
[SPEAKER_00]: funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a lot of other people get to see
them as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get treated like a rock star when you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first part of that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the chocolates are kicking in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's a part B of this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says favorite place to visit or
vacation in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have four seasons here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get spring, summer, fall, and winter,
very noticeably different climates,
[SPEAKER_00]: environments here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, we got a lot of different types of
environment here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the foresty stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got mountainy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we got ski season.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got like lake season and shit like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of different things to do
and places to go here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Picking a favorite place to visit and
vacation would be very, very hard to do
[SPEAKER_00]: just one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to come to my neck of the
woods, Southern Colorado, and want me to
[SPEAKER_00]: show you around, I'm taking you to Bishop
Castle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking you like Lake Isabella.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm showing you outside stuff and real
majestic outdoor shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're in Denver and it's nice out,
we're going to go toward the downtown
[SPEAKER_00]: area, especially if it's getting like kind
of toward Christmas and it's not snowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Downtown Denver is fucking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks great.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's ski season time, we may go up to a
little ski town, whichever we're closest
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all really adorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of great ski towns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of depends on what the vibe is,
what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got so much great shit here to offer
and it's so seasonally that you kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: have to take advantage of the season and
do what's available at this time of year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depends on when you're coming,
where you're trying to go and what the
[SPEAKER_00]: vibe is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you taking a lady out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you showing the bros a night out on
the town?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to escape on your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really makes a huge difference here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say Bishop Castle is a great
place to take people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meow Wolf, of course, is an amazing place
to take people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love comedy works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a huge comedy nerd.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're into music, you got to go see a
concert at Red Rocks, but that's all the
[SPEAKER_00]: cliche shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once we do all that, then we'll go
sneak off to all the fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That nobody knows about that only the
Colorado folks know about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will take you there when you get here,
but I'm not going to tell everybody about
[SPEAKER_00]: it on a podcast because I don't want to
blow up all the spots and overcrowd it and
[SPEAKER_00]: make it not as cool anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to say Meow Wolf,
Red Rocks, Bishop Castle, Comedy Works,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then all the good restaurants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to just go eat good food in Denver,
go walk around in Boulder.
[SPEAKER_00]: That whole area is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, Wyens is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Manitou Springs is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of great shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot more to get to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't pick one favorite place to
visit in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: This place is gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're going to keep moving
because I can get quite rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already feel the chocolate kicking in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next message came from our friend
Soil2Bowls, and it says, I would like to
[SPEAKER_00]: know more about your music past.
[SPEAKER_00]: What led you to the drums?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did playing drums and music professionally
change how playing music made you feel?
[SPEAKER_00]: They wrapped the message up with,
gave my mom a hug for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said, you seem nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for hugging her for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me slow down to catch my breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will talk about this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to know more about my musical
past?
[SPEAKER_00]: What led me to the drums?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure exactly what led me to the
drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something when I would listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I grew up, when I was younger,
I have some uncles I often talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rest in peace, bros.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my one uncle Troy is still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two of my uncles are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of were my male role models,
male influences.
[SPEAKER_00]: They listen to a lot of rock music.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of classic rock, a lot of metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Metallica was played quite often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amongst those three, Metallica was
probably the main commonality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those three uncles, their favorites
would have been Metallica together
[SPEAKER_00]: collectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just hearing that music, I was always just
bobbing my head, banging my head to the
[SPEAKER_00]: drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I'd go to concerts,
I'd just catch myself staring at the
[SPEAKER_00]: drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I fell in love with the band
Metallica.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned Metallica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, when I was younger, I was a huge
Metallica fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe my uncle's live music and just
feeling the drums and noticing that
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody just, without the drums,
you can't bob your head right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you could think you can, but there
needs to be some drums to bob your head or
[SPEAKER_00]: dance properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's part of why I fell in the drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fell in love with the drums is probably
Metallica.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember my uncle had a Chevy El Camino.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know what that is, big up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't, you're better off.
[SPEAKER_00]: My uncle had a Chevy El Camino and he took
me to a concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my two uncles smoked a joint in the
front of that El Camino and they played
[SPEAKER_00]: the black album by Metallica.
[SPEAKER_00]: That smoke wafted into the back and I
caught a nice buzz and I heard the black
[SPEAKER_00]: album.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the way to that concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time I got to the concert,
I was convinced I was going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was, so that's a big part of it right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did playing drums musical and music
professionally change how playing music
[SPEAKER_00]: made you feel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something about knowing the dirty,
filthy side of the music industry that
[SPEAKER_00]: makes you just kind of not want to jump
into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like jumping into the pool,
but then finding out there's fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: alligators in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, I want out of this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was cool until I knew those all filled
with fucking alligators and sharks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of fun, but you have to be the
right minded person.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have the right drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have just, you have to be a
solid, strong person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a strong person and I developed
addictions on the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely, I was an alcoholic and I
wasn't a specific drug addict.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a whatever the fuck you got tonight
drug addict.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some drugs I wouldn't do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong, but like we were doing
party drugs and fucking music drugs and I
[SPEAKER_00]: would do all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had them tonight, that was what we
were doing tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all of whatever you brought to the
party.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being on the road, it changed me a lot
because there were addictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were temptations, but also the music
industry is kind of grody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're lied to a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're manipulated a lot until you're
signed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're struggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just struggling to get signed or
make it or have some support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get support and you get signed,
then you're their bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're working just, you're trying to find
someone to work for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you get someone to work for,
you're just working for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give you money, but every couple of
weeks they want to progress support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how many shows have you played?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many shirts have you sold?
[SPEAKER_00]: How's the recording going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you booked the next tour?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is every member of the band healthy?
[SPEAKER_00]: How's your drug habit going?
[SPEAKER_00]: How's the van running?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, that's just normal
responsibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also we're in a band trying to write
music, play music and enjoy this without.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of the logistics playing a club,
playing at a club all night long or three
[SPEAKER_00]: nights in a row, Friday, Saturday,
Sunday, or Thursday, Friday, Saturday,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then going to collect the money from
the club owner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're a total dick about the deal
that they wrote you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got it in text message or email
or between another promoter and the
[SPEAKER_00]: promoter says the club should pay you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The club says the promoter is supposed to
pay you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just played three nights in a town.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know where the fuck you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have any friends there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have any backup and the club
just stiffed you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of shit puts like a salty flavor
in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you get that sort of stuff,
when you're, it sucks the passion out of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you thought you were going to have a
hotel room and dinner and gas money and
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't, it starts to piss you off and
the music isn't as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the four guys in the van,
you're not as close anymore because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: hungry and you're pissed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now when he farted in the van before,
it used to be funny, but now that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: hungry and pissed off, when he farted in
the van, I want to punch him in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just goes that way and then it
builds up and it kind of sucks the passion
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, for me, you could tell that I'm
getting some weird emotions out of it
[SPEAKER_00]: already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about punching somebody in the
mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just hypothetically, you guys ain't going
to hit nobody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never did.
[SPEAKER_00]: But being in the van and being broke and
hungry, it changes your mindset.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, do I really want to do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the music, but like I could just go
get a job and it wouldn't be as bad as
[SPEAKER_00]: this is today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's only sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's the one hour a night when
you're on stage and everybody's putting
[SPEAKER_00]: lights on you and taking pictures of you
and screaming your name and singing your
[SPEAKER_00]: lyrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the work that goes along with that,
you're either working to get hired or
[SPEAKER_00]: you're hired and you're somebody's bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you're hired and signed, then you're
working for a record company or a promoter
[SPEAKER_00]: and they want a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're their bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a job at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever your band is, went from like
Patreon, the rock band to Patreon Inc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you got to get insurance, licensing,
taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets way different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I got a job at guitar center because
with all my musical knowledge and
[SPEAKER_00]: abilities, I was like, I could definitely
work at guitar center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I would work at guitar center for an
eight hour shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you get in the car, most people,
when you get in the car after work,
[SPEAKER_00]: you crank up some music and drive fast,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would fucking turn down the music.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to hear anything after
working at guitar center all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could hear the guitar department playing
Enter Sandman, ACDC, fucking Back in Black
[SPEAKER_00]: or Welcome to the Jungle or Walk by
Pantera all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be the same five songs all
freaking day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking what's the one, the crazy train.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hear crazy train all the fucking time
at guitar center or just some basic blues
[SPEAKER_00]: solo from everybody in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all think that they're the coolest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never played it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the third person today to come into
guitar center and play that lick,
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But bet between the music industry and
guitar center, learning about the music
[SPEAKER_00]: business and then learning about the music
equipment industry, how they're just kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of, they make you think you're buying one
thing and you're really not.
[SPEAKER_00]: The things that the artists have,
you can't really buy that unless you get
[SPEAKER_00]: it custom made and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I felt bamboozled by both the music
industry and the gear industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it did make me a little bit
bitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, there is more, change how you
make music feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if I could play in a band now with
just like a bunch of old guys around here,
[SPEAKER_00]: local, I'm not saying old guys,
I'm fucking 40 something years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could get a bunch of 40 or 50 year
old guys that just wanted to play for fun
[SPEAKER_00]: and there were no contracts, no alcohol,
no drugs and none of that shit involved,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to say, hey, learn these 10 tracks
and we'll go play them in the garage
[SPEAKER_00]: tomorrow so that all of our wives can hang
out and watch us play like rock stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it would be fun for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like being on the road and all that
shit, the spotlight and shit with music
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't sound fun anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it did change how I feel about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend wrapped this message up with
gave my mom a hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell mama that you got your message on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm gonna keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next message came from our friend,
Uncle Gigi.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, what's your favorite song to play
while in the garden or while gardening in
[SPEAKER_00]: general?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dang, I think the edibles I ate are
kicking in because as I was reading that,
[SPEAKER_00]: the words got smaller and the lights got
brighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something's happening over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the question?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Favorite song to play while in the garden
or while gardening in general?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I have vague answers for all of
these questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna say that depends on a lot of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the mood that I'm already in when
I walk into the garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that mood the mood I need to be in or
do I need to shift my mood?
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe I just went to lunch and like,
I came back too hyper and I can't focus or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll put on like a Joe Rogan podcast
just to slow down my brain and just kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of get me into what Rogan's saying and
then I'll slow down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I smoke too many fucking dabs on my
lunch break and I'm fucking goofy,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I'll go in and put on some
fucking like really fast fish,
[SPEAKER_00]: like punch you in the eye or something by
fish tube, maybe sand or first tube or
[SPEAKER_00]: Sigma Oasis or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking say it to me Santos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put some shit like that on and that'll
give me some energy and get me moved up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it all just depends on the needed
shift, the needed change or the needed
[SPEAKER_00]: vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a lot of people in the grow,
we'll just put on some classic rock and
[SPEAKER_00]: turn it down kind of low.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I like to do in a
commercial grow that really encourages
[SPEAKER_00]: people to get there first is if you were
first in the commercial grow that I
[SPEAKER_00]: manage, if you're the first employee
there, you get to pick the music for the
[SPEAKER_00]: first quarter of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means from eight o'clock until ten
o'clock, the music is your choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got guys that listen to country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got guys that listen to death metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a guy that listens to this weird
math metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same rhythm doesn't happen more than
twice and it's all in like really odd
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking time signatures, but that's what
the dude likes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he's there first, bro, we're listening
to math metal for two hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a guy that listens to crazy rap.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a guy that listens to old school
hip hop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know what you might get,
but the first one to get there gets to put
[SPEAKER_00]: on the fucking music.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's up to me and my personal growth,
it depends on the mental state that I need
[SPEAKER_00]: to be in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm sweeping floors and just doing
stuff where I'm not paying super
[SPEAKER_00]: attention, I might have some faster,
louder, funkier music on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be most likely some fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be some reggae.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be some old school Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be Moe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to listen to a lot of Moe in the
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives you a lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, if I'm cutting clones and
I need to slow down and pay attention or
[SPEAKER_00]: something, then I may put on a slower
podcast or maybe even some slower,
[SPEAKER_00]: older Grateful Dead just to get my brain
in that slower pace instead of zipping
[SPEAKER_00]: through the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go a little bit more patiently,
have a little bit more focus, get the job
[SPEAKER_00]: done, a little bit more, what's the word
I'm looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mindfulness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be more aware, be there,
be here now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thing I'm going for sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also when you're just doing that labor
work, I want to check the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you put on crazy music and jam
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uncle Gigi, I do think you for the great
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the good Patreon questions going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another one right here in front
of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel those them chocolates is kicking
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, my eyes are getting super warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I can't even talk anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said this one, this message,
this next one came from my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: He calls himself all mixed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also call him 311 in the live feeds and
in the chats.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, where's a place you would like to
visit?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I want to go to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kick it on the island of Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I want to disappear into the hills of
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to spend a day in Kingston,
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go all over, all over Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have I said Jamaica enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then randomly, I would love to visit
Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of cool shit in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like a lot of cool castles,
a lot of cool scenery, a lot of great
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then all over that Amsterdam area,
all of that part of Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to go hit all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start in Europe maybe and just take a bus
every day to whatever you could get to or
[SPEAKER_00]: a train.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that area of Europe looks very
interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to hit Italy because I want to try
some fucking good Italian food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where else would I like to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote down Sweden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miss Irie or Dread Vibes or Zara,
as you know her, is originally from
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweden.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's only been here in the States for
about 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to go to Sweden and see the
things that she tells me about.
[SPEAKER_00]: She tells me about her childhood and her
life before she came to the States.
[SPEAKER_00]: She tells me how different it is there and
just subtle differences and major
[SPEAKER_00]: differences in a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to go experience that,
smell the air, see the mountain and the
[SPEAKER_00]: city and all the stuff that she talks
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go see Stockholm because she tells me a
lot about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a fun time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never thought of going to Sweden
until I got with her and it sounds like a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of fun and it's really random.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then a random place that I wrote down,
which is really attainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just all about timing and I've never
bothered to do this, is the DW Factory in
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxnard, California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've played the drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said this on the show maybe today
since I was about 14 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy DW Collector Series drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I'm fond of.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are made in a factory in Oxnard,
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Occasionally they do DW Day and you get to
go do tours.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some reason, I feel giddy inside when
I think about going to do a DW tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to watch them simply make drum
sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it sounds crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could watch how it's made,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to smell the different kinds of
wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hear the machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fond of the guy that owns the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name's John Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to shake John Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: John Good's hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's known as the Wood Whisperer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk to him about wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds crazy, but I'm a tone
wood nerd.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know what tone wood, maples and
different types of wood and flame maple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could use all kinds of wood for drums
now, but Sitka spruce and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I'm in love with that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm obviously the fucking edibles are
working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about wood at the DW Factory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would really love to go tour the DW
Factory in Oxnard, California.
[SPEAKER_00]: They quit doing the tours because of the
pandemic, but they've opened up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on a very limited basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day when I'm in Southern California
and the wife's got some stuff to do and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm freed up, that's what I'm going to go
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go see the DW tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to punish her and take her
with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep her.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it because you'll go see DW drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll meet John Good and then you never
know which of your favorite drummers could
[SPEAKER_00]: pop in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day they just show random people
like, look who popped into the DW offices
[SPEAKER_00]: today and it could be your favorite
drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody from like Eric Moore to Thomas
Lang to Peter Erskine, all kinds of great
[SPEAKER_00]: people are DW endorses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you never know who could pop in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know I could get a free drum
lesson, throw some paradiddles with one of
[SPEAKER_00]: my favorite drummers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am high as giraffe pussy and I am
rambling about the DW Factory tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think my favorite places I would
choose to go would be Jamaica,
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that Germany trip, I want to alter
it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start by landing in
Amsterdam and then that'll be the home
[SPEAKER_00]: base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course we'll hit coffee shops
and then just take day trips all to all
[SPEAKER_00]: the places all around there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to visit Sweden because that's where
the queen is from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that DW factory in Oxnard,
California, of course, is on the list just
[SPEAKER_00]: for shits and giggles.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, it feels like the
[SPEAKER_00]: chocolates that I ate before this show are
starting to do their thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is time for me to wrap up this
YouTube portion of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to continue this show in just a
few minutes on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a little bit of a break,
get a drink in myself, reorganize my notes
[SPEAKER_00]: here, get some fresh air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will be back to do a Patreon only
podcast.
