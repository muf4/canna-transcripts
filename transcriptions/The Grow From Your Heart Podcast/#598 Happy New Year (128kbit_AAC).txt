[SPEAKER_00]: Happy New Year, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta
Jeff and this is episode 598 of the Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, we're going to talk about
setting ourselves up for success in the
[SPEAKER_00]: new year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let's do a few shout
outs to a few members of the 710 club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the 710 club are the folks who
support us on Patreon at the $7.10 a month
[SPEAKER_00]: level or higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with no further ado, let's start with
the big Grow From Your Heart podcast shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out to the captain and commander of the
[SPEAKER_00]: 710 club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's follow that one up with a big thank
you shout out to Jonesy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a big thank you to Derek
Hilberg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a big thank you to Brian P. And
last, but certainly not least,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's send a big Grow From Your Heart

[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks and big shout out to everybody
who supports the podcast on Patreon.

[SPEAKER_00]: All the information you need to support

[SPEAKER_00]: screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I did include a link in the
show notes and in the video description to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it super easy for all of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, Happy New Year, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the New Year's episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the last episode of 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to put 2020 behind us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a couple of things to cover
before we get into the setting ourselves
[SPEAKER_00]: up for success part of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first order of business is I owe a big
thank you to my buddy Dirtman Dan.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of episodes ago, I was talking
about the great Christmas gifts I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said somebody sent me some drumsticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were engraved.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say the Grow From Your Heart podcast
and take a fat dab and give your mom a hug
[SPEAKER_00]: for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know where they came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, surprise, surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those came from our buddy Dirtman Dan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Dan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a beautiful gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my favorite stuff is playing the
drums and talking about the podcast and
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So beautiful gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friend Dirtman Dan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those sticks are sitting right up above me
for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got them up there up on the artwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt that was an appropriate spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next order of business is what did you
think of that camera setting in the last
[SPEAKER_00]: episode?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of a lot of feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people love the lighter muted
colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people hated that dark color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came out differently than what I
thought I had done.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal was to kind of take some of the
red out because of that red shirt that I
[SPEAKER_00]: was wearing made me made the video really
red.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to color correct that I made
it a little bit light trying to soften it
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it may be more appealing for the
eye instead of being super bright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I realized after I published it that
my new monitor and reality are not set
[SPEAKER_00]: accurately.
[SPEAKER_00]: My monitor made everything look brighter
than it actually was.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I watched it on another screen on
YouTube, it looked really dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do need to recalibrate my monitor,
change a few settings there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get it up to speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all of the feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you hated it, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't change it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you loved it, you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't change it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do my best to make the video look
good in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying that you guys, I'm learning
a lot of new equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as the content of the show is
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm mainly focused on trying to make sure
the video and the audio are top notch as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still learning all this audio gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm learning a final cut pro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm learning a new computer monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously it's a lot to work with,
but thank you for the feedback and excuse
[SPEAKER_00]: me if you didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also it's free and you're still able to
listen and learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hope you loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, it is now 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time you listen to this,
there are only a few thought a few hours
[SPEAKER_00]: left in 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to close the door on this
year, flip the page on the calendar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put 2020 behind us and look forward
to 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's also keep in mind that things
aren't going back to normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the new world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a while before things go
back to normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a while before we get to
hang out and congregate, join up in groups
[SPEAKER_00]: and smoke down and have a good time like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take good care of ourselves in this
weird time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care of your physical health,
your mental health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care of those around you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang out on zoom with some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what you got to do, just take
good care of yourself and try to adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adjust to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let your mental health stay strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your spirit strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I really miss events.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the time that I should be
preparing for the endo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally endo Expo would be three weeks,
maybe four weeks away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am kind of feeling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to stay positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Endo Expo is where I get to see half of
the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody from the world flies to Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically my backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a short drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a nice hotel up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just a couple of minutes from the
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get to go see everybody on the planet from
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm getting, we're all getting skipped
on that this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure we're all feeling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody with the company in the
industry, we're all losing out,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just on the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: The business we'll make up for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever the economy will do its thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Money is money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I miss all the people, all the
interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would take so many photos, give so many
hugs, hang out with so many people and I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I miss that event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to stay positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep my head up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys do the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope this show helps you stay positive
and help you keep your head up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Fumidor and the flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody that was on Fumidor's,
I forget the name of your show brother
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on the spot and I didn't write it
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: He always changes it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fumidor has changed the name of his show a
couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I was hanging out with Fumidor on
his YouTube channel earlier today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really helps me keep my spirits up by
going on there and just chatting with a
[SPEAKER_00]: few of my smoky friends, my grower
friends, my cannabis community friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just staying in touch with everybody keeps
my spirits high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move forward with this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, my point is happy new year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2020 is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not going to get back to normal
for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your head up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's set ourselves up for success in
2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we going to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: A good way to set yourself up for success
is by setting goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the start of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's set some goals and have some
resolutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will tell you straight up that one of my
new year's resolutions is to get better at
[SPEAKER_00]: replying to emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I suck at answering emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get, I used to say I get a hundred
emails a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I get about 200, 250 emails every
single day that are not spam.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably another hundred spam
messages to filter through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm trying to go through them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do love you and appreciate every single
one of you, but keep in mind that there
[SPEAKER_00]: are 5,000, maybe 6,000 people subscribed
to this YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus the people that are emailing me from
I read genetic stuff, plus all the
[SPEAKER_00]: contacts I get from the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be patient with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I don't reply right away,
don't think that I'm ignoring you or
[SPEAKER_00]: dissing you or it's something personal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get to every message,
but it's just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2021, I'm going to be better at
answering emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one of my resolutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I think I have responded at this
point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have responded to all of the
Patreon messages in my inbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon was messed up for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't able to respond on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has been fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can now read your messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can now reply.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've printed out a bunch of great Patreon
messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I haven't replied to you directly on
Patreon, if you feel like I have ignored
[SPEAKER_00]: you, please resend a message and I will
get back to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I haven't read your question on the
show, be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've printed a bunch of those questions
and they are coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've kind of been focused on the more of
the New Year's, the Christmas sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff because everyone's possibly on
vacation, taking a holiday, doing family
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want the people that sent in
Patreon questions to skip their episode
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're doing family stuff and
missed the question or missed the episode
[SPEAKER_00]: where I answered their question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after the New Year, after all this
chaos is over, I will get back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a method to my madness for not
doing all the Patreon stuff lately,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think I've caught up on all the
Patreon messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've printed all of the questions and
those will be coming up on the show very
[SPEAKER_00]: soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps the next couple of episodes will
be Patreon focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we going from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy New Year, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep saying that I'm excited for a new
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2020 was a pain in the ass for a lot of
people that had a lot of ups, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: downs.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people had more downs than ups.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you lost some people, if you lost loved
ones or family members, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how that feels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to stay positive and trying to keep
my head up and be grateful for what I do
[SPEAKER_00]: have this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what are we going to do in 2021?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to try to start fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is a good way to start fresh in a
grow environment, in a grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a grow focus show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's focus on starting fresh in our
grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how big or small your grow room
is, it is a good time to clean up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cleanliness is next to godliness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cleanliness will prevent so many problems
in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get organized, get clean, set some goals,
have a strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is a good time to clean everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first way to set ourselves up for
success is to clean everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in that grow and polish everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some cleaner, get some bleach,
get some Fizan 20, get some gloves,
[SPEAKER_00]: get some clothes that you don't mind
getting super dirty, and let's get in that
[SPEAKER_00]: grow space and spit shine everything in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make it look brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be able to eat off of your grow
room floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to walk in there with a sandwich
and drop the sandwich somewhere and feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like I messed up your grow room,
not your grow room messed up my sandwich.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be able to pick up my sandwich,
my burrito, whatever I got, and just keep
[SPEAKER_00]: eating it right off your grow room floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how clean I want to get the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's clean everything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's clean the walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times we don't clean the walls
frequently enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some bleach, get some Fizan 20,
get some hydrogen peroxide, whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: choose to clean your grow with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get some of that and let's clean the
walls, clean the ceiling, mop the floors,
[SPEAKER_00]: wipe down all of the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you cleaned the tops of your lights
lately?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you cleaned the tops of your stuff
that you can't see above your head?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you cleaned that shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you taken a rag and cleaned your
ducting?
[SPEAKER_00]: The ducting ducts that run from the carbon
filter out of the whatever facility?
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a rag and just shine the top of that
shit off and see how much dust comes off
[SPEAKER_00]: of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things are filthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where else are we going to clean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you cleaned the LEDs?
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently cleaned my LEDs and they were
filthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was embarrassed at how dirty the little,
it's the diode, the circle part,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's about the size of a 50 cent piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cleaned that bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were bugs and grime on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean your LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also something people forget about a lot
is clean your fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just the fan blade, not just the cage,
but that cage in the back also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the fan blade off and clean it all
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the fan blades back on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little bit of dirt on that shroud,
a little bit of dirt on your fan blade
[SPEAKER_00]: will drastically reduce the amount of
airflow created by that fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're still spending the electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fan's not moving as much air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're essentially ripping yourself off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get in there and clean
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's clean the walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's clean the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't think about cleaning
the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean behind all that shit that you
haven't moved out and clean behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's spit shine everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it look like high times is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to come over and do an
inspection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want us to embarrass you?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take photos and publish it
on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's clean up our grow room like we're
going to be on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to clean with bleach or Fizan 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are my two favorite products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bleach is readily available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people don't want to use bleach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fizan 20 is also a great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use about 30 milliliters per gallon of
bleach.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make everything nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it smell very hospital and
sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear personal protective equipment when
using any type of abrasive cleaners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now's a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got empty pots, if you're using
plastic pots, put them in the back of the
[SPEAKER_00]: truck and take them to the car wash and
spray them down with that car wash hose.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's to stop you from cleaning your pots
out at the car wash?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a legal environment,
if you're in an illegal space,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe reconsider this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you don't take those pots to the car
wash and bust yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a legal area, take your pots
to the car wash and just spray the shit
[SPEAKER_00]: out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can leave them in the back of the
truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray them while they're in the back of
the truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got a truck, that's a really easy
way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times they have that clip for
your floor mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put a plastic pot in that clip if
you set it up right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put two of them in there and hose
the shit out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them dry before you stack them up too
tightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe put them in the back of the truck
and drive around to get them to dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to stack them up when
they're moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll smell funky when you get to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But take your pots to the car wash and
clean them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're somebody that uses fabric pots,
you can take those fabric pots to the
[SPEAKER_00]: laundry mat, put them in the washing
machine, put them through the dryer there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and clean them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do it at home because your wife or
girlfriend will kick your ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: She doesn't want to come home and find
your grow pots in the laundry and the
[SPEAKER_00]: washing machine at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nothing's stopping you from taking
them to the laundry mat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clean your pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something that people often,
often overlook.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't clean their pots well enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is also a good time to replace a lot
of things that we use in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is a really good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long has it been?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know when the last time you
replaced your bulbs are?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not using LEDs, if you're using
an HPS or a CMH, how long has it been
[SPEAKER_00]: since you replaced that bulb?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're still paying for 100% of the
electricity going to that bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that bulb is losing its life,
you may be only be getting 70,
[SPEAKER_00]: 60, maybe 50% of the lumens of the PAR of
the PPFD coming from that bulb landing on
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're still being charged 100% of the
electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's change out the bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get brand new bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's write down, on January 1st,
I put new bulbs in all of these fixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to get a piece of duct tape or some
kind of tape and write January 1st,
[SPEAKER_00]: new bulbs, and stick that right on the
outside of the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's never a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: When did I change the bulbs?
[SPEAKER_00]: It says on the door, January 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, those old ballasts, a lot of you
guys are using the digital or magnetic
[SPEAKER_00]: ballasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those don't last forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those do need to be replaced and updated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it time to replace and update your
ballasts and your drivers also?
[SPEAKER_00]: The LED drivers will burn out over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, your LED lights will lose efficiency
over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They last much longer than the HPS and the
metal halide bulbs and other bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But over time, your LEDs will lose
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's make sure that all of our gear is
up to speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to pay for electricity
that's coming from the line, coming
[SPEAKER_00]: through the wall, coming down the cord,
and then not giving you 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want 100% coming out because you were
paying for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get new bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get new ballasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's check the drivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's update anything we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we're doing this, let's make a
little note.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stick it on the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: New bulbs, new ballasts in this room,
January 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, keep receipts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down how much you're spending on
your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep every receipt this year for
everything you spend on your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take your electricity bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a photocopy of that and keep that
with your receipts as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's a bad idea in prohibition
land.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in a legal area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep track of your stuff in a legal area
if you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, maybe create a fake Google Doc.
[SPEAKER_00]: With fake words in there that only you
know what the code is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But try to keep track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's think about what we're spending on
everything in the grow this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk more about that in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where are we going to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now's a good time to replace all of the
filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of filters that are
available in our grow spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got HIPAA filters stapled to the wall
over some ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an air conditioner with filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got carbon filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a filter that runs on a pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I use a stir pump or a feed pump,
there's a filter on the outside of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now's a good time to replace all of the
filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take out the filter and your air
conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's got a filter in it, clean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to take that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it needs replaced, replace it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, now may be a good time just to check
all the filters in your home HVAC,
[SPEAKER_00]: in your heater, in your air conditioning,
in your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get in there and clean everything up
and make everything more efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check the air conditioner filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a air conditioner on wheels.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the portable kind with the ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a filter right in the back that
pops right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to take it out about once a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just spray it down with the sprayer from
the sink and it comes nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry it off with a paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It maybe takes five minutes to do the
whole job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now's the first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now's a good time to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write that on your chore list.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a chore list,
put clean the air conditioner filter on
[SPEAKER_00]: the chore list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does your carbon filter work?
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not notice that your crop smells
stanky and skunky and the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood can smell it and you can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be time to replace that carbon
filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we gonna do when we replace it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Write January 1st, new carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stick that shit on the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got new bulbs, new ballast,
new carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are ready to rock in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else are we gonna replace?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the seals and light covers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a baffle that's hiding light
from something?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are all of your ducts sealed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Go around and check all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are all of your windows cocked properly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is all of the places where you think that
light and air could leak that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: sealed up in the past, is all of that
stuff still secure?
[SPEAKER_00]: Has any of your tape or caulking or
camouflaging come undone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you get complacent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're too worried about watering every
day, mixing up nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it harvest time yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're checking the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're fighting a nutrient deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also worried about the new
PlayStation or our girlfriend or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: we're thinking about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you thought about all of those seals
and your camouflage and all the small
[SPEAKER_00]: details that you were really, really
worried about when you set up that girl
[SPEAKER_00]: and forgot about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you get complacent and forget about
some small details that could really fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: you in the end?
[SPEAKER_00]: Check all of your seals and baffles and
light covers and camouflage, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: that carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check on all of that stuff and make sure
you're not getting yourself in any sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another very important thing that we can
do here at the start of the year that we
[SPEAKER_00]: should do every two weeks to at least
every month is calibrate our pH pins.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what kind of pH pin you're
using, it is time to clean and calibrate
[SPEAKER_00]: that bad dog at least once a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the proper cleaning and start with a
storage solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take it apart, clean it up, recalibrate
it, recalibrate it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about using multiple test
standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just have one jar of seven and one
jar of four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have two jars of four and two jars of
seven so you can check them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Double check yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That pH pin is one of the most important
pieces of gear we use in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think and destroy our garden if it
gives us a bad reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a friend who was dealing with the
pH pin that was messed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got a new pH pin and corrected it and
he's like, bro, my garden took off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that pH pin was killing him,
embarrassing him, making his garden look
[SPEAKER_00]: like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care of your gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the appropriate gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure it's properly calibrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your garden will show the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's time to calibrate your pH pin
and clean up your EC meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other meters, gauges, anything you're
using in the grow, now is a good time to
[SPEAKER_00]: get in there and clean that shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let it be dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let it be funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2020 was funky enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's clean up for 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is also a good time to restock all of
your empty supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have enough nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have enough pesticides?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have all of your first aid kit
stuff on hand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, let's check the expiration dates on
a lot of our bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long has that old bottle of CalMac
been sitting there?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long is that bottle of something you
haven't used in a long time?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long has that been sitting there?
[SPEAKER_00]: These products do not last forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do expire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go check the expiration dates on your
bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: If some of those nutrients have been there
for more than six months, I would toss
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's been there for a year in the
corner getting dusty, it is trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of that stuff doesn't sit very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want you to buy it and use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not use old funky products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, smoke alarms and fire extinguishers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are your fire alarms up to date?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have batteries in your smoke
detectors?
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't beep, they're useless.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're decorations at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hung those up with faith that if there
was an emergency, they would let you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't replaced the battery,
you're failing yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your equipment is failing you.
[SPEAKER_00]: A battery isn't that expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could buy a pack of batteries for
like, I don't even know what batteries
[SPEAKER_00]: cost anymore, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably 12 bucks for a nice pack of
batteries to fill all of the smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: detectors in your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a few smoke detectors
and you've got to grow, I find it
[SPEAKER_00]: irresponsible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cause problems with the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe electrical shit goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want it to you guys, but reality
is that electrical fires do happen,
[SPEAKER_00]: shit goes wrong, bulbs catch on fire,
things go wrong in a grow, have a smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: detector.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the point of a smoke detector
without a fire extinguisher?
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the appropriate size fire extinguisher
for the space in which you are working.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got a big space with a lot of
lights, you need more fire extinguishers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a small home grow,
one decent size fire extinguisher should
[SPEAKER_00]: work, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, call 911 and get the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's be prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have that fire extinguisher just in
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, have you ever sprayed a fire
extinguisher?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe give it a practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that challenging, but when you're
under pressure, everything is challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know what to do when there's a
fire in your home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna shit your pants will be the
first move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make sure the second move is to know
how to get that fire extinguisher,
[SPEAKER_00]: get the pin out, point it at the bottom of
the fire, and spray in bursts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to do the long spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a few bursts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're hitting the right spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if you're effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then go hard if you need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a fire extinguisher trainer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was taught.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, make sure your smoke alarm and
fire extinguisher are up to date.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a little gauge on them,
red, yellow, and green.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fire extinguisher is not a Rasta.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just telling you, I need charged.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the middle of okay, or I am fully
charged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red, yellow, and green.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to figure that out from
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned it a moment ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your first aid kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to have to use the fire
extinguisher or the first aid kit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if they're there and you do need it,
it's going to be very advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna be glad it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna wish you had it if you do
need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm getting to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out your first aid kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have all the stuff that you think
you may need?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have some good band aids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Small, medium, and large band aids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a big ass band aid in case
something goes wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have some gauze?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have some eye rinse?
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have a bottle of saline
solution and emergency eye wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be near you at all times if
you're working with pesticides or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything, but do you have that available?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a plan for if you get hurt?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get something in your eye,
what are you gonna do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that I can open up Siri on my phone
and say, hey, call this person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a couple of people that Siri will
call for me and back me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have some sort of a strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we going from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have enough gloves and Tyvek suits?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is a good time to restock rubber
gloves and Tyvek suits.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I spray, I like to suit up in the
Tyvek paper suits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have enough of those?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to go to do a job and
realize you don't have the tools for the
[SPEAKER_00]: job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's prepare ourselves, set ourselves
up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's order the items we need now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way when it's time, they're sitting
there on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have respirator cartridges?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I spray, I like to use the 3M
respirator with the big cartridges on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the appropriate carts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the package down there so I know
exactly what to order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a good respirator and
respirator cartridges?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know how to properly clean your
respirator?
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn how to clean your respirator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn how to put it on and take it off
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people take the respirator off
and contaminate themselves while taking it
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't know how to put on and
take off your respirator appropriately,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you don't know how to clean it
appropriately, it's useless to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please learn how to put it on,
take it off, and clean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine you just sprayed a whole room with
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got pesticide on your respirator
and on your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an appropriate strategy to taking
that mask off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please read and understand fully how to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a full other episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could talk about that for probably an
hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not gonna do that today,
but it's a good time to restock your
[SPEAKER_00]: gloves, your Tyvek suits, and your
respirator cartridges.
[SPEAKER_00]: While you're at it, reorder any pesticides
that you may use.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use a bottled spray pesticide,
if you used a powdered pesticide or
[SPEAKER_00]: fungicide, let's restock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not run out of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're in panic mode, you see some
mites, you go to get that pest spray,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're all out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we gotta order it and wait two or
three more days for it to get here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your bugs are gonna get out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get that shit in stock on hand now.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about goggles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have good goggles?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those goggles get misshapen,
they get dirty, they get fucking stomped
[SPEAKER_00]: on, they get left in weird places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are your goggles in good shape?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds very super nerdy to be
worried about goggles, but when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying, when we're mixing shit,
eye protection is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your eyes are the most delicate organ on
your body that are exposed to the elements
[SPEAKER_00]: and vulnerable to attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get shit in them very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, they're one of your most used
organs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your outer organs, your senses.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you gonna do without your eyes?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not gonna be quite the grower you
were if you get something in your eye and
[SPEAKER_00]: go blind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's protect our eyes, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm all about the extra protection,
but we've gotta be safe in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are looking up to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gotta set a good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've covered most of the things we
need to buy and clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I went quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gotta clean everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gotta restock everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's inspect everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are all of the pieces of gear,
every moving part, is it working the way
[SPEAKER_00]: that it needs to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does your air conditioner make a weird
noise?
[SPEAKER_00]: Update all that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the dehumidifier working properly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the humidifier working properly?
[SPEAKER_00]: While I'm thinking about those,
let's clean those as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in there with bleach or Fizan and
clean it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take it apart completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those, that little bottom part that
you missed, I'm gonna find that if I come
[SPEAKER_00]: look.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take it apart, you clean it before
we've got to embarrass you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here's another good thing to do for
2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start taking COBA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start taking copious notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's write down everything we do in the
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's write down everything we purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's write down every adjustment to
equipment we make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's write down everything we mix up,
every pH of every solution we feed,
[SPEAKER_00]: every EC of every solution we feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should definitely be writing down every
pesticide application, any spray
[SPEAKER_00]: applications that happen to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start taking copious notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several reasons for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you make a mistake, you can look back
at the notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can say, man, these plants started
messing up around the first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say look back at the notes
about two weeks ago and see what you did
[SPEAKER_00]: two weeks ago and pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see somewhere where you fucked up
and you'll go, oh, right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: look, this day the pH was off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is what messed up your crop now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you make a mistake, you can look back
and see what you did wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if your crop comes out perfect,
if it's the best crop ever, you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know exactly what you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't take any notes, it's just,
I think I might've given it this on this
[SPEAKER_00]: week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might've done this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can't repeat the exact same
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have a different outcome
next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be chasing that result and
you'll never get it again because you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know exactly what you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a lot, a lot of notes in
2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep a grow journal, keep a grow diary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that way we can set ourselves up
for even better success in 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: Planning ahead?
[SPEAKER_00]: Strategy?
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who would have thought?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how business works, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how successful people do shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's set ourselves up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's set ourselves up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's also see what our grow costs and
profits this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're growing for
yourself, for your own medical needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're a black market
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you run a commercial grow,
but let's see where are the profits and
[SPEAKER_00]: losses.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you make that grow better next
year?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you make it improve financially?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you make it make you better
medicine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you consider a profit,
whatever you consider a loss, let's write
[SPEAKER_00]: down everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every penny that gets spent in that grow,
if it's on a light bulb, if it's on bleach
[SPEAKER_00]: to clean the grow, if it's on seeds,
if it's on nutrients, the electricity,
[SPEAKER_00]: the water, everything that goes into that
grow, write it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a note of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you harvest, write down every
consumable gram that you make.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use the trim for something,
write that down as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you've got to do this in a code
because you're in a red state,
[SPEAKER_00]: do this in some sort of a code,
but let's write this all down and see
[SPEAKER_00]: where we are profiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: and where we are losing in our garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very important now.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the price of cannabis going so low in
legal places and the cost of electricity
[SPEAKER_00]: and gear being so high and the cost of
seeds and dirt and everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is a real good time to start doing a
profit and loss sheet on your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not selling anything,
you know what cannabis is worth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what each ounce is worth.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what you are paying for each ounce and
then consider your time and labor and
[SPEAKER_00]: effort into that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what you're getting out of this grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important, in my opinion,
to know where the money's going and what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're getting out of it and what is cost
effective and what is just falling right
[SPEAKER_00]: through the fucking hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to throw money away,
especially when we're all on this pandemic
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know where money's coming from
next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's waiting for a stimulus check.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to get political,
but money is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's document every penny,
see where we can save a few bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we can buy a better piece of gear
next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we can see that this nutrient we're
using isn't worth a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Re-adjust, re-strategize based on the data
that we find.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another thing we need to do is set some
goals for 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were you not good at in 2020?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you not a good cloner?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you not answer your emails frequently
enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever it is, if it's in your grow,
if it's in your life, I'm doing a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend you pick a few grows,
a few goals for your grow and obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: pick a few goals for your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's set a few goals in 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to be better at cloning?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to get better at mixing your
nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to understand VPD?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to be better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to just get better overall
harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want more turps?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want fatter weights?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to learn about breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your goal in 2021?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now's the time to think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's refocus and regroup because I
know that 2020 kicked a lot of our asses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like I came out on top,
but trust me, I lost family members.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things weren't the way that they were
supposed to be this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did have plans for 2020 with myself and
with this company and with my family.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that shit got kind of rearranged
and pushed aside, but I'm readjusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm re-strategizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm refocusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm keeping my mental health strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: My spirit is strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: My physical health seems to be strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit sneaks up on you, I guess,
but I feel like I'm doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is time to refocus and regroup and
reset our goals for 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adjust and realize things are not going to
be the way that they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for things to go back to
normal, you may not be setting yourself up
[SPEAKER_00]: for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got to adjust and adapt 2021
through 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2022 will be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The world's not going to go right back to
the way it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if this pandemic, this virus,
if it just goes away, it's still going to
[SPEAKER_00]: take a little while for us to readjust and
readapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So set yourself up, set some goals,
have some plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of all, take good care of yourself,
take good care of the people around you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget to smile and have a good
fucking time.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how stressful life can get,
no matter how worried you are,
[SPEAKER_00]: have a good time because no one's going to
make it out alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody will make it out alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So enjoy it while you're here,
ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for listening to this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a really fun episode for me to
record.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a good time.
