[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I think I've covered all of the
news and updates here for the start of the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's work our way into everyone's
favorite portion of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: This of course is the question and answer
portion of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a website that website is
ieregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the top of that website, there is a row
of tabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them does say grow questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you click on that tab, you are given
the opportunity to send me a grow
[SPEAKER_01]: question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I read that question here on the
podcast, I will send you a coupon code for
[SPEAKER_01]: a free pack of seeds from i read direct
.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first question on today's episode came
from our new friend who is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: called Biscuit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biscuit, welcome to the iRE Army.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And make sure you check your inbox because
you have a coupon code for a free pack of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds at i read direct.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question from my new friend Biscuit
goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says Hey Rasta Jeff, I've got a
question for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what, dude, this was a great
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will really get me rambling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for the good springboard here
on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, Can you please tell me the
difference between a BX1 and an S1 seed?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, I will give you a very good
detailed explanation of the difference
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question does go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, My understanding is that a BX1 is
the plant Black Cross 2 itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a little different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to explain that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of stuff in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it says I have a pack of permanent
marker S1 from another breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the package, it says permanent
marker to permanent marker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now isn't that a back cross?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to explain why in some
detail here in a moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says please help me understand this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You always explain things the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it says thanks in advance.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dude, you are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a lot of great notes here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me try to stay focused.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will talk about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got two very specific questions to
deal with here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about what is an S1 and what
is a BX.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, we're going to talk
about what are the similarities and
[SPEAKER_01]: differences in those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also going to touch on a whole
different realm called an R1, but you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: see where that fits in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where are we going to start with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start with the BX or the BC,
if you will, the back cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is a back cross?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would somebody do a back cross?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the purpose?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why does it exist?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's dig into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: A back cross, a back cross is essentially
if you take, I'm going to have to take a
[SPEAKER_01]: minute to unfold this, but it will all
come together in the end, a back cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take progeny of a parent plant and
breed them together, if you go backwards
[SPEAKER_01]: in a filial generation, that is a back
cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have bred back to a previous
generation, back to a previous parent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why the word back is in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going backwards in the breeding,
which is not necessarily a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is to stabilize things that can lock
things in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about the main reason why
someone, including myself, would do a back
[SPEAKER_01]: cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about the plant golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody knows I love working with golden
goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Golden goat is what is known as a clone
only.
[SPEAKER_01]: Golden goat seeds were never put out until
I did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The original breeder never put out the
golden goat seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were no seeds released.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only way golden goat was put out to
the public was the breeder that made it
[SPEAKER_01]: released a clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was released as a clone only.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a term that will be important for
the rest of this podcast and learn about
[SPEAKER_01]: clone only.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clone only means the breeder that made it
never put out seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's that one clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that clone only version.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's available as the clone of
golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can make feminized seeds of golden goat,
and those are widely available.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one way to make seeds, but many
people in the growing community are not
[SPEAKER_01]: into feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not like fem seeds for whichever
reason, and that is fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of stigma, a lot of
questions, a lot of miseducation around
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many people simply do not prefer it,
and that is okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what people want.
[SPEAKER_01]: So perhaps a grower wants golden goat
seeds, but like I mentioned before,
[SPEAKER_01]: golden goat is a female clone only.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are no pure golden goat seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I want to make golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I going to do to create golden
goat seeds that are not feminized?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the easiest way to do it would be
to create a back cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to do that, we have to open up that
golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to adulterate it with another
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be pollinated by something to
create a starting batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I would recommend, what I have
done, this is how I made my golden goat BX
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took the original golden goat girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found another plant that was completely
different in all ways than that golden
[SPEAKER_01]: goat plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used a daybreaker male as the plant that
I used.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got giant leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: The golden goats got skinny, thin,
sharp, very serrated leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: That daybreaker plant has giant leaves
that look like dinner plates.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could build a canopy underneath them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could build a canoe with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could build a hammock with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: These were gigantic leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: The golden goat grows kind of compact,
kind of tight nodes, kind of tight node
[SPEAKER_01]: interspacing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The daybreaker was real stretchy and real
wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I used that daybreaker to pollinate my
golden goat plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The offspring was really easy to identify
the plants that looked like golden goat
[SPEAKER_01]: because they had skinny, very serrated
leaves, not big, wide fingery,
[SPEAKER_01]: big fat leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything with a big fat leaf with a
stretchy shape, I got rid of that
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately because that was not golden
goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was daybreaker heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got rid of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found a male plant that looked just like
the original golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm doing is I'm washing out all
of the traits from that daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have now found a golden goat male that
looks just like the original golden goat
[SPEAKER_01]: mommy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went as far as to pull leaves off of
both plants and hold them up next to each
[SPEAKER_01]: other and look at the amount of serrations
and the shape of the leaves and the spread
[SPEAKER_01]: between the fingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was really OCD about this selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I found a male that looked just like
that golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I pollinated the golden goat with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, why is that a bat cross?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this golden goat was the original
mom in that cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took the daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took the golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made seeds from those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found a male golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cross, but it looks just like
golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took that pollen and I went back to the
mom and put that pollen on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that is now my golden goat bat cross
first generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is why we would do a bat cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is how a bat cross is done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would we do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we want seeds of that that are
pure golden goat, but there's no way to
[SPEAKER_01]: make a golden goat pure seed because
perhaps you don't have the parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only the female.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the first way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to open up the line, make seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to adulterate it, adulterate it,
make seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next step is to start washing
out the adulteration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have now made seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have found a plant that looks just like
my golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I breed that to golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to make more seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take those seeds and guess
what I'm going to do again?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to find another one that looks
just like that golden goat and put it back
[SPEAKER_01]: on the original golden goat clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is my bat cross too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my second filial generation of that
bat cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of different ways you could
go about doing that, depending on the
[SPEAKER_01]: traits you want, what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the way that I would do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep, keep making seeds back to that
golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what we're doing is every time
you go to the golden goat plant with that
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen, that progeny has less and less of
the daybreaker in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're washing out that daybreaker with
each filial generation if we do it
[SPEAKER_01]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is a bat cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how, why, and what I would do a bat
cross for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's talk about the other part of the
question, which was S1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is an S1?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would we do an S1?
[SPEAKER_01]: How was that useful?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's focus again on the original golden
goat plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many people out there in the world want
the golden goat plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have got the original golden goat clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of breeders, a lot of
growers out there, a lot of medical
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers, a lot of recreational people
out there that would really enjoy and
[SPEAKER_01]: really benefit from having golden goat
seeds so they can grow it and benefit from
[SPEAKER_01]: the effects of this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am able to offer pure, unadulterated,
feminized golden goat seeds to the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how do I do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a very easy process once you
understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take a clone of the golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take another clone of the golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got two clones of the exact same
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are both golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are not introducing anything new in
this process.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this time, I will treat one clone with
a solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am using silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am also experimenting with a new
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we will treat this clone with a
solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to be the proper dilution,
the proper intervals, the proper time.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a lot of stuff that goes on to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am going to spray this plant seven times
over the course of its life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I am going to do is create a
reaction in this plant that will create
[SPEAKER_01]: this female plant to create pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That only contains female chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I know it sounds like a lot of
wizardry.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot is going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you understand the science of it,
it's really not that amazing, that hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not going to explain it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have done a full episode on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I treat this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now I am going to give a big
disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The word herm, hermaphrodite, intersex is
not involved in this at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you are making feminized seeds,
the word herm should not be involved at
[SPEAKER_01]: all.
[SPEAKER_01]: If herm is in there, don't use it to make
intersex plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or don't use that to make feminized
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't use any intersex plants in any
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no herm happening when making
femme seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am treating a female plant with a
solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am treating it with silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: The silver gets into the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It disrupts the copper movement in that
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That creates a hormonal reaction inside
that plant that makes it create anthers
[SPEAKER_01]: which create pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not a hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not a male.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a reversed female.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a big difference than the other
things I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those anthers will drop pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That pollen will be feminized pollen
because there are no male chromosomes
[SPEAKER_01]: available in this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am going to take that golden goat
reversed pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it on a golden goat female plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what I just did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made pure golden goat seeds that are all
females.
[SPEAKER_01]: So S1 is all golden goat to golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The BX1 is golden goat to something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then back to the golden goat to wash out
all that other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the basic difference is regular and
feminized.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other difference is one is adulterated
and one is unadulterated golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do filial generations with that
back cross and wash out whatever we use to
[SPEAKER_01]: open it up or start the back cross with.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can wash that out through two,
three, definitely through four back cross
[SPEAKER_01]: generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the femme seeds, there is no need
to wash it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the feminized seeds in the first
batch, 50% of those seeds are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: look just like the original golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you are going to get about 20 of them
that look like the mom of the golden goat,
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 that look like the dad of the golden
goat, and then you are going to get 10%
[SPEAKER_01]: that are just fucking weirdos.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are going to look like grandparents,
great grandparents, weird mutations of all
[SPEAKER_01]: of the above.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is just the way the genetics kind of
mix with that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me check my notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure I am on track here to keep
myself going.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have talked about back crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about when, where, why,
and how that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have talked about making an S1 of the
golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's talk about R1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is an R1?
[SPEAKER_01]: An R1 is very simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me give you a phrase that you are
going to remember here that you will never
[SPEAKER_01]: forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a little crude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a little crass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I promise you are never going to forget
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: An S1.
[SPEAKER_01]: A self plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That plant selfed itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went and fucked itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: An S1 is because that plant selfed itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is an S1.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now an R1.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we are going to talk about the R1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: The S1 is if I were to take the pollen and
put it on the same plant itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: An R1 is if I were to take the pollen and
put it on the same plant itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I take that golden goat pollen and put
it on any other plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is just indicating that I have used
reversed pollen to indicate that this is a
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized project here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The R1 is the first filial generation of a
reversal project.
[SPEAKER_01]: The S1 is the first filial generation of a
selfed project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So S1 is a self.
[SPEAKER_01]: R1 is a reversal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning I put the pollen on any plant
other than what I reversed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am just opening up doing more breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is a very viable breeding idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do that with a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is how orangegasm is made.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is how lemon jeffery is made.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I am making golden goat femseeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I reverse one golden goat plant and I put
that pollen from that one plant on another
[SPEAKER_01]: golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just made golden goat S1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: While I am in the room why not put it on a
lemon skunk to make some lemon jeffery
[SPEAKER_01]: R1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it on the platinum tangy to make
orangegasm R1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not just get creative and do stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is the back cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is R1 and that is S1.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is my story and I am sticking to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dude biscuit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh also I can't speak for the breeder that
made that package.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know exactly what they are doing
but with what the details you have given
[SPEAKER_01]: me that is going to be an S1.
[SPEAKER_01]: They took just like they said they took
that permanent marker plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other permanent marker plant they
reversed one put the pollen on the other
[SPEAKER_01]: they did not add anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't go backwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it is feminized you have got yourself a
permanent marker S1 is what you have got
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again my dude biscuit make sure you
check your inbox because you have got a
[SPEAKER_01]: coupon code for a free pack of seeds from
irydirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright podcast world let's keep this good
momentum going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have another question here in front
of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This question also came from the grow help
tab on irygenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question came from our new friend
Barry Bryant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barry Bryant welcome to the iry army.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again make sure you check your inbox
because you have got a coupon code for a
[SPEAKER_01]: free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says greetings my dude greetings bro
good to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says this thought was brought to you by
orangegasm the tasty breakfast treat to
[SPEAKER_01]: get your day started.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a really good tagline a really
good ad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have put that on the packaging
but I did not.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is more it says anyhow I do have a
hypothetical idea or question for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a good question I like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says what if I have a two by two veg
tent with one big pot of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I throw in a handful of seeds and let
the seeds fight for survival.
[SPEAKER_01]: One plant remains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that one plant actually the keeper or
is that a dumb way to sort through a batch
[SPEAKER_01]: of beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is one way to do it but in my opinion
you are not going to find the plant with
[SPEAKER_01]: the best turps the best buzz the best
resistance to pathogens the best
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance to bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are going to find the plant that just
fights the best which might not be the
[SPEAKER_01]: best plant for smoking consuming selling
medicating whatever you are going to do
[SPEAKER_01]: with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the plant with the strongest roots
the most aggressive plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I have talked about selecting male
plants from a population I am going to say
[SPEAKER_01]: that this may have the same sort of
criteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let us just say that you do find one plant
that is super vigorous and super strong
[SPEAKER_01]: and wins.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is going to be the plant with the
most robust roots the most fibrous stocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not necessarily going to be the
plant with the biggest fattest juiciest
[SPEAKER_01]: stickiest stinkiest most trichome laden
buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like when I talk about selecting
males I say if we have got five male
[SPEAKER_01]: plants to choose from that first plant
that grows real tall and shows that it is
[SPEAKER_01]: a boy and is real vigorous get rid of that
because it is just too vigorous.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are making hemp fiber it is going to
be all male in the breeding mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like your female plant that
survives this run is just going to be real
[SPEAKER_01]: hempy real fibrous it is not going to be
good smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be a bad ass grower it might be
something to breed to to add productivity
[SPEAKER_01]: vigor strength and all that into another
plant but I do not think it is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: the one that we are going to want to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not going to be the one that makes
people say damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be the one that makes a grower say
damn but not the consumer not the
[SPEAKER_01]: clientele not the patients not the
customers and that is who we are trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: impress the people that actually smoke the
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is a good idea it is a fun game to
play I do like the battle of the fittest
[SPEAKER_01]: idea the Beyblade idea you got going on
here but I would not do it that way I
[SPEAKER_01]: would give them all their separate pots
because like I said the one that wins is
[SPEAKER_01]: it going to be the best smoke it is going
to be the strongest plant and that is a
[SPEAKER_01]: big part of selection but that is not the
only thing and I think you could find
[SPEAKER_01]: better if you grow them separately.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am rambling I have made my point.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dude Barry Bryant this was a good fun
question so make sure you check your inbox
[SPEAKER_01]: because you have a coupon code for a free
pack of seeds from this question came from
[SPEAKER_01]: our friend special K I feel like I have
already made friends with special K a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time ago shout out to my new friend
special K this is a fun question it says
[SPEAKER_01]: hey Rasta Jeff thank you for the continued
good vibes and good advice hey that is
[SPEAKER_01]: what I am here for thank you for noticing
it says when you are gifted seeds how do
[SPEAKER_01]: you decide if you want to try them thanks
again I hope it is going smoothly bro
[SPEAKER_01]: everything is going iry for me the podcast
is coming out well the day has been good
[SPEAKER_01]: been having some fun in the grow so
everything is iry let's answer this
[SPEAKER_01]: question here a little bit how do I decide
that I want to grow gifted seeds that is a
[SPEAKER_01]: very very good question every couple of
months I do like to pop a new batch of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds I pick out some of my stuff a couple
of lines I pick out stuff from other
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders and I want to see what my stuff
does right next to theirs in my rooms I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to see what my new creations do
compared to my old creations I am very
[SPEAKER_01]: curious is what I am saying here so after
I choose what of my seeds I am going to
[SPEAKER_01]: run sometimes I pull out my whole seed
collection the big hoard of seeds that I
[SPEAKER_01]: have got and I look through and I decide
like oh this looks interesting or oh I
[SPEAKER_01]: have been thinking about that but really
it is all about do I have room that is the
[SPEAKER_01]: main do I have space to grow these seeds
and then what else is in the room and how
[SPEAKER_01]: much time are those plants going to take
if I am picking a bunch of OG Kush or a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of Indica stuff I am not going to
find other hazes to go with that because
[SPEAKER_01]: that is going to fuck up the whole room so
if I am running let's just say I just
[SPEAKER_01]: found a bunch of random something
something OG Kush seeds and I am going to
[SPEAKER_01]: run some Kush and some shit that I cross
to OG I am going to go look into my batch
[SPEAKER_01]: for one more OG Kush varietal from a
friend that may match up with that so that
[SPEAKER_01]: is one of the first criteria do I have
room and then does whatever I am thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: about running does it match the rest of
the room because I don't want shit one
[SPEAKER_01]: plant 5 foot tall and the other plant 8
foot tall I don't want some shit 55 day
[SPEAKER_01]: which is hypothetical you are never going
to get a 55 day flower I don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: something at 55 and something at 82 days
of flower because that is going to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: bitch to manage so I think about plant
compatibility in the room is one thing
[SPEAKER_01]: then what is the cross is there something
that is getting my attention is there did
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoke something recently I keep saying
OG Kush did I smoke a Kush that has got me
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking damn I want that turp or I really
need that in my arsenal is there something
[SPEAKER_01]: I am missing if there is something I am
missing maybe that is what I am looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for maybe I got a pack of seeds that
somebody said hey do you have guava in the
[SPEAKER_01]: line up and I thought I don't so I am
popping a pack of guava from nothing but
[SPEAKER_01]: gas big shout out to my boy nothing but
gas but I will have guava so there are a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of things that dictate me deciding
which pack of seeds to grow it could be
[SPEAKER_01]: something I need it could be a trade it
could be a flavor it could be a turp I am
[SPEAKER_01]: after it could be a breeder that I just
want to give a chance it could be a friend
[SPEAKER_01]: like my friend nothing but gas he has been
putting shit out for a while it is time to
[SPEAKER_01]: give him a run and see what he is up to
see if his seeds are good he is a good
[SPEAKER_01]: dude he is a cool guy why not run his
seeds while I have got some room and see
[SPEAKER_01]: how those seeds are going to grow like I
said it is all about do the plants match
[SPEAKER_01]: up do I need that terpene do I need that
flavor do I need that growth do I need a
[SPEAKER_01]: trait from that plant for a breeding
project so it could be a turp that I am
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for it could be a specific trait
in a pack of seeds I am looking for a
[SPEAKER_01]: growth structure maybe I have got a
breeding idea that that is going to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: precursor to maybe I want to make
strawberry vanilla biscuit cookies and
[SPEAKER_01]: this one has got vanilla biscuit and I am
just trying to find that turp to get maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: it is a spring board or a stepping stone
maybe I have got a friend that has been
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding for a long time and as I am going
through my seeds I have got like a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of stuff that is going to be 90 day
flowering and I see his pack and it says
[SPEAKER_01]: 90 day flower and I go hey let's run this
or maybe just like I am letting my buddy
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing but gas have a spot in a grow
space maybe I am just running those guavas
[SPEAKER_01]: because it is time to give my friend a
chance he has been at it for a long time
[SPEAKER_01]: he has been putting in the work I have got
his seeds they fit the criteria why not
[SPEAKER_01]: run those and see how they do so there is
a lot of determining factors do they fit
[SPEAKER_01]: the timeline do they fit the growth shape
are they a stepping stone is there a trait
[SPEAKER_01]: that I need is there something hyped up in
there that has got my attention did a
[SPEAKER_01]: friend breed it that I looked at it and
said that guy deserves attention or also
[SPEAKER_01]: with all of that being said it could also
be completely fucking random I might look
[SPEAKER_01]: at a pack and go wait star berry skunk
weasel I want to grow that I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: why but I do just like a lot of times out
there you guys see a strain name people
[SPEAKER_01]: are going crazy people went crazy for
anything with the ninja turtles on it you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys go crazy for that I've got a new
strain coming out that I haven't said the
[SPEAKER_01]: name on a lot of public forums I do talk
about it in the on the discord server
[SPEAKER_01]: every time I say the name people want some
of that people wanted cherry skunk before
[SPEAKER_01]: they ever saw the plants when I said I
have cherry skunk they said take my money
[SPEAKER_01]: so a lot of it is names a lot of is just
random packaging it's whatever gets my
[SPEAKER_01]: attention advertising and marketing works
on me too sometimes I'm trying not
[SPEAKER_01]: to fall for it but that shit does get me
of criteria take it out what you will but
