[SPEAKER_00]: supporting the show and you would like to
learn how to do so all you have to do is
[SPEAKER_00]: visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow
from your heart all of the information you
[SPEAKER_00]: need will be right there on the screen and
you know i do include that link in the
[SPEAKER_00]: show notes and in the video description to
make it nice and easy for all of my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends speaking of making things easy for
all of my friends i got a very weird
[SPEAKER_00]: patreon message i'm not gonna say who it
was i'm not gonna say their name i got a
[SPEAKER_00]: question about i was straight up
relationship love and relationship and
[SPEAKER_00]: family and marriage advice and i'm gonna
say right now at the top of the show
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not what this is about i am in no
way qualified to give you relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: advice that sort of stuff this is a
cannabis growing show somebody paid money
[SPEAKER_00]: on my patreon to ask me a relationship
advice question i asked if they wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: their money back they did not want their
contribution back i felt it very weird um
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm not the guy to come to for that so uh
that was awkward that's all i really got
[SPEAKER_00]: to say about that i wanted to address that
on the show because first of all it was
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of i thought they might be trolling
me but then i realized no this person paid
[SPEAKER_00]: money for this uh they might be serious so
i contacted them i was like bro is this
[SPEAKER_00]: for real like yeah i need your guidance
and i was like i'm not the person dude i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not a relationship counselor all i'm gonna
do is i'm a 42 year old single guy not the
[SPEAKER_00]: guy to ask for relationship advice from uh
i just want to make it clear don't don't
[SPEAKER_00]: send me relationship questions on patreon
you'll get your money back and also that's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of funny i thought it was funny once
i was like this is real i don't know if i
[SPEAKER_00]: thought it was funny or when i thought it
was trolling or when i realized it was
[SPEAKER_00]: real either way that was my laugh of the
week i thought i'd share it with you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship advice on patreon that's kind
of funny maybe i should have taken the
[SPEAKER_00]: money and given my best advice it did not
feel right i don't have that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: qualification you guys all right let's
jump into some real content here on this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast i do have a patreon question here
in front of me that does come from a
[SPEAKER_00]: longtime patreon supporter who would
rather remain a non a mouse it goes a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: like this it says
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a very good question uh what our
friend here is asking is about making
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble hash they're going to uh there's a
lot of good ways to do this but uh let's
[SPEAKER_00]: just stick to the point they're going to
make some bubble hash they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: extract the uh trichomes from the plants
using ice water ice probably some bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: bags and some agitation that's the main
way to do it they're going to freeze the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes off the buds collect them
through some sort of a sieve bag that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the way it's going to happen here so our
friend is basically asking which iri
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic strains wash the best because they
do plan to make some bubble hash they are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to use bubble bags and ice and water
and agitation and remove the trichomes
[SPEAKER_00]: from the plant material to make smokable
concentrate some people from there will
[SPEAKER_00]: press that make it even cleaner and better
some people will just smoke the bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the quality that they make
there are a lot of methods to doing that
[SPEAKER_00]: in the winter time it's a great time to
make bubble hash because the colder uh
[SPEAKER_00]: your environment the colder the process
the better the concentrate that is an
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage of being here in colorado in the
winter time let me get myself back on
[SPEAKER_00]: track our friend wants to make bubble hash
and to make the best hash they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: know which iri genetic strains have been
known for making the best bubble and the
[SPEAKER_00]: best wash concentrates i do have some good
feedback for you i can see tell you right
[SPEAKER_00]: away that the
[SPEAKER_00]: cream is going to be my very first
recommendation however the cream is
[SPEAKER_00]: getting close to being sold out for ever
once the cream sells out i'm not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: make any more um nothing against the cream
plant excuse me nothing against that cream
[SPEAKER_00]: plant it is just uh it's not something
that i'm going to work with uh anymore
[SPEAKER_00]: it's time to move on i make some things i
produce them for a certain amount of time
[SPEAKER_00]: and then sometimes i just simply move on
i'm only allowed to have so many plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: the garden you guys know that and so uh
the cream the mom plant that makes the
[SPEAKER_00]: cream has been eliminated i don't have
that plant anymore couldn't make more if i
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to i could f2 it i could s1 it
however it is time to move on the cream
[SPEAKER_00]: has done its thing uh it's it's worked its
course so i will not be making any more
[SPEAKER_00]: cream seeds if you can find them uh if you
can get them i would get those make some
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble hash with those another line that
would make amazing concentrates is the
[SPEAKER_00]: dark hollow that one makes more of that
real uh musky earthy garlicky scented
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate it's also real light and color
it washes really well i really like the
[SPEAKER_00]: dark hollow concentrates now let's talk
about something else i was at the dude
[SPEAKER_00]: grows cup and my friend kelvin grew
strawberry starburst and they pressed the
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry starburst into rosin the rosin
that pedro made out of the strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: starburst was some of my favorite rosin i
have ever smoked so if you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: press it maybe strawberry starburst might
be right up your alley uh for the pressing
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates i also wrote down that the
blue raspberry truffle has made some
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing pressed concentrates then we're
going to talk about the machine recently i
[SPEAKER_00]: was gifted a batch of the machine so the
machine started off as machine fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: frozen buds they grew the plant they
chopped it down they took off all the big
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves and froze it almost immediately
then they took that and they made bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: hash out of those frozen buds from those
frozen buds then they pressed that in a
[SPEAKER_00]: press and made hash rosin that concentrate
put me on my ass it made me totally goofy
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire time i had that jar of
concentrates around my day was just half
[SPEAKER_00]: done it was like i was multitasking but i
was multi i was actually multitasking
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-fucking things up i wasn't getting
anything done properly i was doing 10
[SPEAKER_00]: things at a time all of them were failing
it was a good thing that concentrate was
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome but it made me stupid it made me
dumb i did a podcast and i don't really i
[SPEAKER_00]: don't recall that podcast i know i did it
i know i had a good time i know it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: good show but i was in a bubble for the
whole time that machine concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: wrecked me so the machine makes great
concentrates something else i've noticed
[SPEAKER_00]: is that all of the lemon strains that i
breed make really tall trichomes and those
[SPEAKER_00]: tall trichomes seem to make good
concentrates so the lemon sunrise the
[SPEAKER_00]: lemon jeffrey those seem to make really
good concentrates i don't know if it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: tall trichomes i don't know if it's the
size of the trichome head i'm really not
[SPEAKER_00]: certain i'm not a concentrate maker or a
trichome head expert so that is not my
[SPEAKER_00]: area of expertise but i do know that those
lemon strains make amazing concentrates
[SPEAKER_00]: now i did say that i'm not the concentrate
maker let me tease an upcoming episode for
[SPEAKER_00]: episode 710 i do plan to have a
concentrate maker on the show i will ask
[SPEAKER_00]: them about the size and shape of trichome
stocks and heads and see how much of a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference that does make in our
concentrate production because i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: interested to learn that type of thing too
so i've been rambling for quite a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about uh bubble hash recommendations let
me kind of recap a little bit and then
[SPEAKER_00]: also let me you should keep this in mind
um i do smoke a lot of flour people are
[SPEAKER_00]: like do you only smoke concentrates no i
smoke a lot of flour i just tend to take
[SPEAKER_00]: more dabs when i'm on the go because uh to
get myself the buzz i want with flowers i
[SPEAKER_00]: basically have to smoke an entire uh big
fat joint about about a two gram three and
[SPEAKER_00]: a half gram joint i gotta smoke that bad
bitch by myself to get the desired effect
[SPEAKER_00]: uh and then i'm just carrying a joint
around or hitting a bowl all day i could
[SPEAKER_00]: take a dab or two dabs in just a couple of
minutes and be lit for a few hours a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple maybe two and a half hours if i
take a couple of fat dabs i could be nice
[SPEAKER_00]: and heavily medicated i would prefer a dab
every hour but when you're working when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're busy uh trying to be productive you
can't be sitting around dabbing all day so
[SPEAKER_00]: i try to stay on the move that's why i
smoke a lot of dabs but i do love smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of flowers i breed seeds i make a
lot of new creations i like to test grow
[SPEAKER_00]: and test smoke and enjoy my new creations
i really love to smoke when i create a new
[SPEAKER_00]: seed line and give it to somebody local
and they grow it and they bring me flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: or bring me concentrates i love smoking
those flowers i love smoking those
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates so i do smoke a lot of
flowers but i primarily have been smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates lately since the whole dab
revolution fired up and uh they're easily
[SPEAKER_00]: available readily available kind of what
i'm leaning towards here kind of what i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: heading for is i think i've accidentally
been breeding flowers that are geared
[SPEAKER_00]: toward concentrate production i don't know
if i was doing it subconsciously or
[SPEAKER_00]: consciously but i prefer to smoke
concentrates so when my harvest is ready
[SPEAKER_00]: when all my flowers are done most of the
time if it's not a seeded product if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: something i grew for myself at least
two-thirds three-quarters of it gets
[SPEAKER_00]: allocated for concentrate production we
don't even trim it uh not the way that we
[SPEAKER_00]: would trim it for uh for smoking which
we'll talk about our concentrate gurus in
[SPEAKER_00]: a future episode to see the difference
between harvesting and growing our buds if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a difference between growing for
concentrate and growing for flowers but i
[SPEAKER_00]: allocate probably three-quarters of my my
grow for concentrate making concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: production because i prefer to smoke
concentrate so i maybe subconsciously
[SPEAKER_00]: secretly in the back of my head have been
breeding so that i can have the best
[SPEAKER_00]: quality concentrates if you think about it
i've got strawberry starburst that makes
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking strawberry concentrates who
doesn't love a strawberry concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: lemon jeffrey lemon concentrates who
doesn't love a lemon concentrate it's i
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of caught myself accidentally
breeding toward that avenue most of my
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff is going toward the most flavorable
most potent concentrates so i said i was
[SPEAKER_00]: going to recap i don't know if i got to
that part uh bubble hash some of the best
[SPEAKER_00]: strains i would recommend would be the
cream i've got great experience with the
[SPEAKER_00]: cream making amazing bubble hash uh then i
would say strawberry starburst then i
[SPEAKER_00]: would say blue raspberry truffle then i
would throw the machine and there
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely dark hollow then all of the
lemon strains that i make fall in that
[SPEAKER_00]: category for making good concentrates i
don't have good experience i don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the education but i think something with
the size of the trichome heads they come
[SPEAKER_00]: from the lemon skunk plant that i work
with i think that results in very good
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates it just catches in the bags
very well and i guess if there's a big
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome head there's got to be a lot of
product inside of that trichome head as
[SPEAKER_00]: well right that's where all the magic
happens i'm not sure what i'm talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about all right uh my friend who would
rather remain a non a mouse i want to
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you for your great message i also
want to thank you for the generous patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: contribution that does not go unnoticed
thank you for that uh look forward to
[SPEAKER_00]: hearing more from you if you have any more
questions please do reach out uh he
[SPEAKER_00]: wrapped this up with take care bro oh also
uh which is the stickiest iris strain of
[SPEAKER_00]: all i think sticky is going to be uh kind
of more about your growing and breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: environment it's all about uh if your room
is dry your weed won't get real sticky if
[SPEAKER_00]: your room is kind of humid if you've got
the proper vpd your weed will get sticky
[SPEAKER_00]: it's got the potential the opportunity to
get sticky then in the dry and cure
[SPEAKER_00]: process you've got to baby that weed and
keep it just right spongy gooey but not
[SPEAKER_00]: not juicy you want to kind of uh that's
that's the fine line right there that's
[SPEAKER_00]: where you get the stickiness i think that
comes from the dry and cure i think
[SPEAKER_00]: anything out of my line uh properly grown
properly dried and cured has the potential
[SPEAKER_00]: to be the sticky icky all right dude once
again thank you for the great question
[SPEAKER_00]: let's keep it moving all right this next
message comes from our friends at cedar
[SPEAKER_00]: city canna and it goes a little bit like
this it says hey rasta jeff thank you for
[SPEAKER_00]: all the knowledge and info you drop you
are very welcome thank you for listening
[SPEAKER_00]: and watching it goes on it says i'm
cultivating indoor hemp because i live in
[SPEAKER_00]: a prohibition state uh be careful you
still may need uh hemp cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses don't think that uh just because
it's hemp and not cannabis that you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: get in any trouble uh side rant random
story sometimes these are people's
[SPEAKER_00]: favorites part of favorite parts of the
podcast we had some friends who were
[SPEAKER_00]: growing cannabis outdoors they possibly
allegedly may have been over their legal
[SPEAKER_00]: limit of how many cannabis plants we are
allowed to have uh in the region in which
[SPEAKER_00]: they were growing the police came actually
uh zoning came it was zoning it wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: even the police because in colorado if
you've got a certain amount of plants over
[SPEAKER_00]: your limit uh and you don't seem like
you're into a criminal activity or a
[SPEAKER_00]: criminal enterprise they just send zoning
so far it's a zoning violation so they
[SPEAKER_00]: sent code enforcement and code enforcement
comes up and they're like sir it seems
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have too many cannabis plants and
my friend said what if i tell you they're
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp plants and he said well then we're
going to go get the department of
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture and find you for your illegal
hemp plants but if you've got illegal
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants we're just going to make
you cut those down until you've got your
[SPEAKER_00]: limit so the options were if they were
cannabis plants we were going to cut them
[SPEAKER_00]: down until we got to our illegal limit
we're allowed to have x plants we had x
[SPEAKER_00]: plus question mark had to cut down all the
question mark get to x while the while the
[SPEAKER_00]: department all the code enforcement guy
watched he basically was like pick them
[SPEAKER_00]: out cut them down that's all i care about
and so the plants got chopped down if they
[SPEAKER_00]: were hemp we would not have had they would
not have had the option to cut down the
[SPEAKER_00]: parts the plants in the question mark
those would have been illegal hemp plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and we would have been fined for growing
hemp without any licensing uh that was a
[SPEAKER_00]: weird dynamic to experience that day that
uh luckily that zoning guy was pretty cool
[SPEAKER_00]: he was just an older guy he didn't want
any shit didn't want any trouble wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: come out and say hey the neighbors say it
smells like fucking dank weed out here you
[SPEAKER_00]: got too many plants i can't really say
much other than cut down the plants and if
[SPEAKER_00]: those are still here in a few days the law
will come and we're like well shit we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: just cut down the plants and the plants
went choppy chop chop into the compost bin
[SPEAKER_00]: that was that uh we were allowed to finish
the crop with the legal amount of plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in that area i told you i was gonna get
rambling so be careful with your hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that is the main point of that
story um let's get back into this i live
[SPEAKER_00]: in a prohibition state and i am on the be
careful growing anything in a prohibition
[SPEAKER_00]: state my friend uh please do it says i'm
on the fence with breeding a cbd cultivar
[SPEAKER_00]: i like that uh with your breeding
expertise um that might be an exaggeration
[SPEAKER_00]: but i appreciate that would it matter for
thc sake which was the male versus which
[SPEAKER_00]: was the female saying orangegasm let's not
say orangegasm because orangegasm's uh
[SPEAKER_00]: femcidin it's got to be uh this will it
may work in here but i just want to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: in mind orangegasm is fem and that bell
went off and the breeder salesman side of
[SPEAKER_00]: my brain say orangegasm pollinated by cbd
cultivar that is possible so you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: female orange gasm pollinated by a high
cbd cultivar or uh pollen from a reversal
[SPEAKER_00]: reversal or a male thc to the cbd cultivar
i see what you're saying thc male to a cbd
[SPEAKER_00]: female or the opposite either way uh i
know you do not grow hemp but if you had
[SPEAKER_00]: any advice or knowledge on the pollen
donor versus the receiver that'd be
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful thanks again um then something cut
out here looks like my printer by the way
[SPEAKER_00]: something is oh uh i think it says
orangegasm is fire the emoji did not print
[SPEAKER_00]: here that's what happened uh by the way
the orangegasm is fire thank you bro i
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate that uh let's talk a little bit
about breeding for cannabinoids you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to create a high cbd cultivar by or
yeah high cbd cultivar by starting with a
[SPEAKER_00]: thc and a cbd high strain so when you do
the first cross when you make that first
[SPEAKER_00]: cross so a lot of you're asking mainly if
it matters if we do the male or the female
[SPEAKER_00]: it all matters um i don't think it 's
going to matter which is the male and
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the female it's going to work
it's going to come down to your selection
[SPEAKER_00]: the first cross is going to open up
pandora's box um it kind of depends on
[SPEAKER_00]: which plant also it depends on which plant
carries the dominant trait which one uh
[SPEAKER_00]: dominates the mix i've talked about this
in previous episodes when we're breeding a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the times the goal is to mix the
plants together to get two traits of a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant one trait traits of one plant traits
of another plant mix those into one plant
[SPEAKER_00]: you hope to see those traits uh those
alleles express themselves and the progeny
[SPEAKER_00]: uh sometimes you see weird shit sometimes
you see stuff from the grandparents
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes you don't see what you're
expecting but it all depends on the
[SPEAKER_00]: dominance co-dominants uh and not
dominance of the genes of the traits of
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant sometimes i've talked about uh
using a male plant that is too dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: excuse me a male plant that is too
dominant in a mix imagine if you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: like just a dude that's just beastly all
the time yet he can't think real well but
[SPEAKER_00]: he could fucking move a refrigerator with
his left hand and you just an ogre just a
[SPEAKER_00]: real ogrely male maybe you wouldn't want
to breed with that ogrely male because all
[SPEAKER_00]: the offspring are just going to be fucking
flat forehead narrow-eyed ogres we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: need a bunch of ogres in the offspring you
want to see some of the female and the
[SPEAKER_00]: cross so i would skip those real meathead
ogrely male plants uh because those are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be due to dominant if you've got
a male or a female plant that could happen
[SPEAKER_00]: on either side you could have a super
powerful fucking femme queen on one side
[SPEAKER_00]: or an ogrely dominant male on one side and
that will dominate your mix and then your
[SPEAKER_00]: cross is just going to be more
representations of the male or female the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids are going to transfer the
same way if the male plant carries the thc
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's a super dominant plant you're
going to see a lot of thc in the offspring
[SPEAKER_00]: if the female plant is super dominant in
the mix and carries the cbd you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to see that or vice versa however it works
just depends on kind of which plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant in its gene passing a lot of
times we'd hope to see a perfect 50-50 mix
[SPEAKER_00]: which is how it works but expression
you're going to see weird shit so now
[SPEAKER_00]: let's talk about the weird shit we're
going to see in my experience from my what
[SPEAKER_00]: you called expertise which i'm not sure i
qualify for but thank you when we first
[SPEAKER_00]: make this f1 cross with these varied
cannabinoids in my experience in my
[SPEAKER_00]: prediction with my expertise what i've
seen what i think will happen is the f1
[SPEAKER_00]: the first cross you take your either way i
don't it doesn't matter if you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: thc male or female cbd male or female you
got cbd and thc male or female we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to cross them bad bitches the first time
you're going to get very high cbd
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars you're going to find very high
thc cultivars then you're going to find
[SPEAKER_00]: things in the middle and everything in
between you're just going to open up
[SPEAKER_00]: pandora's box and get a little bit of
everything at this point i would find a
[SPEAKER_00]: female that is obviously high in cbd i
would try to do lab testing that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: best way to find cbd if that's really what
you're looking for find the one that is
[SPEAKER_00]: the highest in the cbd and lowest in thc
you also need to find the good grower the
[SPEAKER_00]: one that grows well so do the phenohunt
find the one that works best for you find
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant that looks like how you want
your finished project to look like what do
[SPEAKER_00]: you want the plant structure to be like
how do you want it shaped do you want long
[SPEAKER_00]: spaces do you want short internodal
structure do you want long branching do
[SPEAKER_00]: you want short branching what kind of
plants are you into growing find the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that grows the way you need it to grow for
your purpose or the plant that is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: reach your goal so now you've selected a
female from the f1 progeny find a male
[SPEAKER_00]: from the f1 progeny that looks just like
that girl if you can similar leaf shape
[SPEAKER_00]: similar node structure similar everything
find its twin except it's a boy then cross
[SPEAKER_00]: those two pollinate that bad bitch now
you've made the f2s in those f2s we are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to find a lot of crazy shit we are
going to find grandparents and great
[SPEAKER_00]: grandparents expressing themselves but we
are also going to find beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: representations of exactly what we're
looking for for the f2 we found exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: what we want in this batch you're going to
find that exactly the one with the cbd the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth structure exactly what you want in
this batch then you're going to find a
[SPEAKER_00]: male and you're going to do it again now
we are making the f3 now at this point we
[SPEAKER_00]: are actually beginning to lock in that cbd
dominant trait we have found the plants so
[SPEAKER_00]: the f1 when you make that f1 it's going to
be wild you're going to have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff f2 even more wild but there's going
to be a solid plant and there to work with
[SPEAKER_00]: then you're going to use that f2 to make
f3 the f3s are going if we selected
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly the f3s are going to start
showing us exactly what we're looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: if we did this correctly at least 50
percent of the plants we grow should look
[SPEAKER_00]: like the plant we are looking for maybe
closer to 60 maybe 70 it depends all about
[SPEAKER_00]: your selection so at this point here we go
again find the plant that works very well
[SPEAKER_00]: for you the one that makes the cbd the low
thc the flavor you want that grows the
[SPEAKER_00]: structure shape time all of the attributes
that you need find those alleles for you
[SPEAKER_00]: find that plant find the female find the
male here we go again let's pollinate
[SPEAKER_00]: let's cross them now we're making f4 now
at this point your percentage of your
[SPEAKER_00]: stability this is where the word stability
really does come in here this is where
[SPEAKER_00]: your stability will come into play you're
going to start increasing the stability
[SPEAKER_00]: every time you do this if you select
correctly if you don't make the right
[SPEAKER_00]: selection you got to go back to that f2
the f3 wherever you were wherever you did
[SPEAKER_00]: see what you liked go there maybe the step
before and rework that select different
[SPEAKER_00]: plants from the mix so just keep working
this by the time you get to f4 you should
[SPEAKER_00]: be really close to what you're looking for
by the time you get to f5 you'll have what
[SPEAKER_00]: i called what i wrote down as reliable
stable lized phenotypes most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes are going to come out looking
like the plant you're looking for by the
[SPEAKER_00]: time you get to f6 you've got basically
clones you're growing probably 95 98
[SPEAKER_00]: percent of the seeds you toss out are
going to look exactly the same so it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't really matter which plant has the
thc which one has the cbd that first time
[SPEAKER_00]: you cross it you're gonna you're gonna get
the the whole mix of shit the second time
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna get an even wider mix of shit
find the plants you like keep moving
[SPEAKER_00]: forward and fill your generation with your
goal in mind take a lot of notes never be
[SPEAKER_00]: afraid to go back if you messed up and
you're not seeing what you want in the f3
[SPEAKER_00]: f4 go back work the f2 again start there
then take a lot of notes see what did and
[SPEAKER_00]: what did not work also here may be a
useful tip when you were working with
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants you've got a couple of
options you can take the you can take one
[SPEAKER_00]: male and you can pollinate multiple
females what is stopping you from taking
[SPEAKER_00]: one the select male from your f2
population and pollinating three females
[SPEAKER_00]: you got the tall one the short one and the
squatty one pollinate all three of them
[SPEAKER_00]: mark the seeds and grow those and see
which one of those you like the best what
[SPEAKER_00]: is stopping you nothing's stopping you
from pollinating multiple females so
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinating multiple females each round
will give you multiple avenues to work
[SPEAKER_00]: with then you can always cross those lines
together if you get one that has the
[SPEAKER_00]: structure you want and one that's got the
cbd that you want later on cross those
[SPEAKER_00]: together that's always a fun work parallel
lines should i talk briefly on parallel
[SPEAKER_00]: lines so in your first project you were
working strictly for cbd right so let's
[SPEAKER_00]: just breed for cbd on this side all we're
looking for is cbd maybe growth also
[SPEAKER_00]: because you have to have stable uh plants
that can support themselves strong healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: vigorous plants is the word i'm looking
for so we're looking for plant growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: cbd on one side we just breed for that uh
you just just just like i said before f2
[SPEAKER_00]: look for cbd and plant growth f3 for cbd
and plant growth all the way up to f5
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe f6 on another project we're using
the exact same seeds except we're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for different attributes let's say we're
looking for uh maybe it puts out a super
[SPEAKER_00]: strong grape aroma so we're going to breed
other plants over here and we're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for nothing but grape aroma so we're going
to grow them and all the plants don't
[SPEAKER_00]: smell like grapes they get tossed we're
going to f2 the grape smelling plant going
[SPEAKER_00]: to find an f2 that smells like grapes
we're going to f3 that f4 f5 f6 to where
[SPEAKER_00]: every time we grow it it just smells like
grapes every time then we cross our cbd
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant cultivar to our grape cultivar
and we breed those together and you get
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking grape cbd out of your line a true
f1 that you've created all the way from f
[SPEAKER_00]: f yeah that that feels really fun to do
right that's a lifelong project uh maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: something to think about that's just what
i was saying when i say parallel lines i
[SPEAKER_00]: said it had to ramble about it thanks for
listening to that i hope you learned
[SPEAKER_00]: something on that let me get myself back
on track here because i did freestyle most
[SPEAKER_00]: of the info coming out of this question
here a lot of this is going to rely on
[SPEAKER_00]: your selection luckily now we've got
science we've got labs you can do
[SPEAKER_00]: predicated testing if you're looking for
cbd you can take snippets or tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: samples of all of your plants and send
them to the lab and they can say this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant has got the precursor for a lot of
thc or the precursor for a lot of cbd and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can toss those high thc plants and
keep those high cbd plants now you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding out of you've already got half
your population eliminated half your work
[SPEAKER_00]: is done for you you know those
cannabinoids are going to be there now you
[SPEAKER_00]: can grow for a structure the other traits
which you are looking for you can focus
[SPEAKER_00]: more on that predicated testing will
really help you out if that is available
[SPEAKER_00]: affordable cost-effective that will really
speed you up in this program you can
[SPEAKER_00]: identify the presence of cbd precursors
early and vegetative growth yes i know
[SPEAKER_00]: that sounds crazy but then you can get rid
of all those thc plants early and just
[SPEAKER_00]: breed for cbd that will definitely help
you move forward in your generations all
[SPEAKER_00]: right my friend i folded up the paper you
wanted to be called cedar city canna make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure you follow them on instagram it's
cedar city canna big shout out big thanks
[SPEAKER_00]: for the great message i hope i answered
your question you did ask uh which male
[SPEAKER_00]: and which female the traits would come
from but i think i gave you a good answer
[SPEAKER_00]: to your question if you have any
follow-ups to that i would love to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: from you the email address is grow from
your heart at hotmail.com don't be shy
[SPEAKER_00]: send me those questions corrections
