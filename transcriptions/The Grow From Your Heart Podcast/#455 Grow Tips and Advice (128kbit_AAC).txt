[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go, welcome to the show podcast
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 455 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds in your garden,
I highly recommend Seeds Here Now,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can find them at www.seedsherenow
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Stardog
Ambrosia SHO Premium Rosin from our
[SPEAKER_00]: friends at Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label says that this product contains
73.2% THC and 85.5% total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apothecary has recently started releasing
the Premium Rosin, the SHO Rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was reluctant to buy it because it is at
a higher price point and I did not want to
[SPEAKER_00]: fall in love with it, but I think I might
be in love.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aroma is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say that there is a strong aroma
coming from these concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something different about the
rosin concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aroma is more like the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is more similar to the essence of the
way that plant smelled while it was
[SPEAKER_00]: growing and it's got a hint of that dried
and cured plant smell as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ambrosias and the batters get the
essence of the turps of what the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: smells like when it was alive,
when it was growing, when it was fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the rosin gets a fuller,
more of a cannabis-flavored profile,
[SPEAKER_00]: something that a cannabis smoker is more
familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've never smoked BHO and you smoke
the rosin, you may see and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is the flavor coming out of that BHO?
[SPEAKER_00]: You may think it's fake because it is so
turpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The turps are so prevalent in a different
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: This rosin has a cannabis-based flavor to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you've smoked a lot of
concentrates, that may sound weird,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there is much more of a
cannabis-dominant, familiar flavor to this
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it's gotten me fucking rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got my eyes nice and heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something about a BHO or a diamond or a
sauce or an ambrosia or a shatter dab
[SPEAKER_00]: even, when I smoked that, it makes me feel
like I'm kind of bug-eyed, like almost
[SPEAKER_00]: caffeinated off of the amount of THC that
has entered my body so quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I smoked the SHO, the rosin,
it makes my eyes go droopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: My eyes are heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: My eyes feel red.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I get really high from the BHO
and I got really stoned from the SHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure if that's a good
description for people that don't get to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke every day, but the buzz is
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The feeling in my lungs are absolutely
noticeably different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels a little bit thicker,
a little bit heavier, which that makes
[SPEAKER_00]: sense because I can see the consistency of
these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is almost like a heavier,
thicker version of the batter that I smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: on a regular basis, but it is just thicker
and it feels like I get just, I just need
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit smaller of a dab of this and
I get as much smoke and it really punches
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at
Apothecary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't mean to talk about the new
concentrate for two minutes, but I really
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate the flavor, the aromas,
the buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just lingers on your mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It leaves that weed flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I miss from the BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it leaves that, that cannabis that when
you used to smoke a joint, there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is back with the rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to our friends at Apothecary
Farms for the Stardog Ambrosia SHO Premium
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I am going to answer a
couple of grow questions, but before we
[SPEAKER_00]: get there, I would like to give some shout
outs to some friends from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start out with the big grow from
your heart podcast, shout out to Ms. Mel,
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to send a big thank you shout out
to Todd K, I also want to send a big,
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you grow from your heart podcast,

[SPEAKER_00]: From Your Heart podcast, shout out and a
thank you to my buddy Bass steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always a shout out to our buddy Brian B
and last but certainly not least I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: send a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast,
shout out and a thank you to my good
[SPEAKER_00]: friend Aldridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank all of you for your

[SPEAKER_00]: a patron, all you have to do is go to
patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information that you need will
be right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the start of the show, I said that I
was going to answer a few grow questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, I was asked a question by a
friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sent me a picture via email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not print out the message because I
can cover it without printing that paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about his question.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sent me a picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is using a root pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a fabric pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: His plants look beautiful and healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The room looks nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything looks stellar.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got his plants worked into a nice
trellis, so he's developing a nice canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything looks real sexy in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend's one major concern was,
hey, Rasta Jeff, why do I have roots
[SPEAKER_00]: growing out of the bottom of my pots?
[SPEAKER_00]: So my friend is using a root pot like a
fabric pot is a there are many different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of them available now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a giant fabric bag basically
into the shape of a root pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got a lot of breathing room for
your root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically a big potato sack that you
fill with soil or soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you put your plant in there and it
grows really happily because the plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't allow as much airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a plastic pot,
you restrict a lot of airflow to your root
[SPEAKER_00]: zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your roots are growing through the
medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, hey, there's oxygen this
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get to the edge of that root pot and
they say, oh, there's more air out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they grow through right through that
root pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those roots are looking for oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: While they're doing that, they're also
looking for more food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully they find water and food at the
end of their voyage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants that have got the roots
growing out of that bag are simply so
[SPEAKER_00]: happy that the roots have just grown right
out of the bottom of that bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do have the possibility of those
plants becoming root bound in the near
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the size of the plants that I saw
and the size of the container that I saw,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that is going to be a
problem until late in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not all the way to the end,
I think you've chosen the right size pot
[SPEAKER_00]: for the length of which you are growing
that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is happening is some of your
roots are so happy and so excited that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just outgrowing their space.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to see what's on the other side
of that wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that wall is just a little thin fabric
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were able to wiggle the way right
through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the roots are simply on the other
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the roots that I saw sticking out of
the bottom of the pot were at the very
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom corner of the pot, where I would
assume when you water that plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of water stands in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get some runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of the bottom of the pot, you probably
have an inch, maybe a half inch deep worth
[SPEAKER_00]: of water, just chill in there for a short
duration of time until you either suck it
[SPEAKER_00]: up with a shop vac or it drains somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe you just let it evaporate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever works in your environment works.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm thinking that those nutrients,
that little puddle of water, that
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture, and then that dries up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got that very thin boundary for the
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots just say, hey, this is a really
cool direction for us to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just start going that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the pictures I saw, it looked like
these plants are very healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks like that grow room is very
well taken care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think you're going to see any
problems because of that root growing out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the bottom of that pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is actually a sign that you were doing
a very good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you were still in veg and the pot
was smaller and the plant were larger and
[SPEAKER_00]: we knew that you had much more time to go
in that container, that could be a
[SPEAKER_00]: concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since you are as far along as you are
and those roots are that size,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you were timing it just perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you were growing cannabis,
part of your goal is to select the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate size container to be
completely efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too small of a container, you'll get root
bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to water way too frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running like a one gallon pot
and your plant gets big, you may have to
[SPEAKER_00]: water multiple times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got an auto watering system,
that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a home grower and you've got to
water by hand and you've got multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, that can be a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So selecting the appropriate size pot is
very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're growing in a home grow without
an auto watering system and you're running
[SPEAKER_00]: in a soilless mix or even in cocoa,
the idea is to choose the size of
[SPEAKER_00]: container to where when those plants are
getting harvested, you want them to just
[SPEAKER_00]: achieve root bound status.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you got to go, oh man, they're root
bound now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're harvesting tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you want that to time out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to fill that bottom container at
the same time that the top part finishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like too many people overlook the
importance of the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots are where it all starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Healthy roots, healthy fruits,
fat roots, fat fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all translates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The root zone is where it's all happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a healthy active root zone
that you're probably hopefully inoculating
[SPEAKER_00]: with some sort of beneficial funguses,
some sort of root inoculant that will help
[SPEAKER_00]: you reduce the risk of pathogens and
pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things want to go to weaker plants
and healthy plants start at a healthy root
[SPEAKER_00]: zone that moves up through the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those plants don't get diseases and
pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plants with a big fat, healthy root
system are much more forgiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you make a mistake as a grower and your
plants have little shitty roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: they may die from a very simple mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got plants with big fat,
lush, healthy roots, you might be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: abuse them a little bit and they can still
recover because they've got enough life
[SPEAKER_00]: source to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I do have a little bit of a follow-up
to this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody else said, are these mushrooms in
my soilless mix a problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm sure there are a lot of growers
out there who have grown with sunshine mix
[SPEAKER_00]: number four or Fox Farms ocean forest or
maybe some of that 707 stuff or that roots
[SPEAKER_00]: organic stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have all seen those gold cap
mushrooms pop up either on the top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil or they come out of the bottom of the
pots where you got the little drainage
[SPEAKER_00]: holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just get a couple of Smurfy looking
mushrooms growing out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my experience, those mushrooms usually
pop up late in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like they like the late veg
environment, something about the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, something about the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's something to do with the
nutrients, but that is usually when I
[SPEAKER_00]: discover those little golden mushrooms
popping up in the soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my experience, those mushrooms have
never been a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those mushrooms have always appeared when
my garden was at its peak optimal state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were getting those mushrooms,
you were probably doing something right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have probably got a nice, healthy root
zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were probably watering properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably getting enough drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably got enough oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your VPD is probably just right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have always taken those golden mushrooms
as a sign that I am doing a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like to let those mushrooms fall
back into that soil and decompose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like they give life back to that
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that I'm watching that cycle
happen in my head, that is probably where
[SPEAKER_00]: the mushrooms came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were probably just spores in that
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We gave them the perfect environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They decided to develop into mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they are going to decompose and fall
back into the soil and give our plants
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no competition between our
cannabis plant and the mushroom that is
[SPEAKER_00]: growing on that soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are using completely different things
to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That mushroom will not cause any harm to
your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, that mushroom may actually help
speed up the breakdown of some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that are in that soilless mix and
make those elements more bioavailable to
[SPEAKER_00]: our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they work sort of similarly to our
little wiggler worm friends in a very
[SPEAKER_00]: different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got those golden mushrooms,
there is not a problem in your container.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is probably a good sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means that you are doing a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those spores probably came free in
your bag of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're nothing to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them keep growing until they fall over
and die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them decompose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they will provide even more nutrition
to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: While they're alive, they break down
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once they die, they fall back into
your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They decompose and they continue the cycle
of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got some roots sticking out
of the bottom, you're probably doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got some golden mushrooms
growing out of the top or growing out of
[SPEAKER_00]: your drainage holes, you are probably
doing a good job with your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here's another thing I should talk
about while I'm on this subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was not on my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just something that popped into my
head while I was ranting about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have begun making super
soil or some sort of a living soil or a
[SPEAKER_00]: premixed soil that doesn't require
nutrients at every watering, something
[SPEAKER_00]: that you just give it water and an
occasional tea, and it keeps the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: sustained through most of its life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to top dress at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be beneficial to give it specific
teas to support specific phases of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the main idea that a lot of people are
heading for is a super soil mix that you
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the idea is that you put a bunch
of amendments and a base soil together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mix it up and you put some water in
there and you store it in a warm place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that water, the air, all of those
amendments and that warmth create life
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of that container where all of your
stuff is mixed up and it becomes alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is called the cooking process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you make a super soil,
basically you throw a big tarp on the
[SPEAKER_00]: floor, you'll put down a few bags of your
base soilless mix, and then you will mix
[SPEAKER_00]: in various amendments, based on what you
want to do with your super soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever amendments you have chosen,
we mix them up in the appropriate ratios
[SPEAKER_00]: along with that base soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you may sprinkle a little bit of
water on it now, or you may scoop it into
[SPEAKER_00]: containers, depending on how much mix you
have made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will scoop it right into a
large trash can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people scoop it into some of those
like Rubbermaid shipping or storage
[SPEAKER_00]: containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever container you put it in,
that's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to add a little bit of water
in there just to get it activated,
[SPEAKER_00]: just to get it moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you want to seal it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you want to put it in a warm place.
[SPEAKER_00]: The combination of the water, those live
amendments, that warmth, the air in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: they all start creating life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That soil, all of those amendments start
doing a process that we call cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the organic amendments start
breaking down naturally and making
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves more bioavailable to our
plants, so that when we put a plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: this soil, we've got organic soil that is
ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is enriched, it is well balanced,
and the plants will love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your stuff all mixed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You throw it in your containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got just enough moisture in there
to get everything alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put a lid on it, you throw it in a
warm place, and you just leave it for a
[SPEAKER_00]: few days, depending on your goal,
depending on your mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will let it sit for seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will go 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people like to go 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people like as much as a 60-day cook
on their super soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is all about your preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is all about your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is all about your amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no wrong way unless your plants
die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what works for your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not the point here.
[SPEAKER_00]: My point is, during that cooking process,
you need to check on your super soil
[SPEAKER_00]: occasionally to see the progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people like to stir it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people prefer not to disturb it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a super soil expert or a maker,
so I don't have a preference on that for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to learn that yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read the recipe that you're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe start at buildassoil.com and work
your way from there, or check out subcool
[SPEAKER_00]: super soil recipe and work your way from
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what you want to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add, subtract as you feel necessary,
but whip up your super soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then check on it in a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is where people make a crucial
fucking mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your super soil should begin to grow a
nice, fuzzy, white layer of funky,
[SPEAKER_00]: weird shit across the top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should start off looking like maybe a
little bit of a spider web.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it should look like you almost have
maybe powdery mildew or almost trichomes
[SPEAKER_00]: or powdered donuts growing across the top
of your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people will freak the fuck out
when they see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll say, oh God, it's all moldy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You fucking celebrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is mycelium.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the life source that we have been
trying to create in that container.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is a lot of people see that
and they think that they have created a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't realize that that was the exact
goal we were trying to achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were making a super soil,
please do not freak out when you get that
[SPEAKER_00]: fuzzy white stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the magic we were trying to make
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ta-da.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know it sounds silly that I should
even be talking about this, but you would
[SPEAKER_00]: be surprised at how many people I've heard
say it in person, how many times I've read
[SPEAKER_00]: it in forums and how many stories I've
heard about people dumping out large
[SPEAKER_00]: containers of soil mix that they had
intended on using for the next four or
[SPEAKER_00]: five runs in their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spent an entire day mixing it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spent 30 days letting it cook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they opened it up and went,
oh, I ruined it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they simply threw it all away or they
just dumped it in the yard because they
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to mix it out with yard dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not realize they had just created
super soil, which was the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see the mycelium, that is what you
were trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boy, that really took longer than it was
supposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move forward with more grow
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another question somebody asked me about
growing was when I cut clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: why do I cut the tips of the leaves off of
my freshly cut clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I'm taking clones to make fresh
plants, I usually cut, I'll probably cut a
[SPEAKER_00]: six to eight inch section off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get a bunch of those in a cup with
some water in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will carry those to my cloning
station and I will take one cutting out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the water and I give that cutting what I
call a haircut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will take the leaves and I will trim
them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the leaves are kind of shaped.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're shaped like they get skinnier and
then they get fatter and they get skinnier
[SPEAKER_00]: again, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: At the very thickest point is where I like
to cut them to where they get fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I cut them right there to where
they don't have a chance to taper back to
[SPEAKER_00]: skinny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it tapers really wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut it at the widest point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the leaves are only about half the
length that they were when we started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will cut the base of my stem at a
90 degree angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will trim that up a little bit,
kind of shave it just a little bit with my
[SPEAKER_00]: scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: My point is to open up that outside flesh,
anything that is going to get dipped into
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using, if you're trying to stay
all organic and you want to use aloe or if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to use olivias or if you're
going to use clone X, whatever you choose,
[SPEAKER_00]: however far you were going to dip that
clone into your cloning solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to take my knife blade and just
kind of scrape that edge of that clone up
[SPEAKER_00]: just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm trying to do is open up that
outside layer, open up that fiber so the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots can grow out of that more easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to grow from the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to lightly scrape that outside
skin off just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to go fucking it up and make
it real rough and messy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to give it an opportunity for
problems, but I do want to scrape it and
[SPEAKER_00]: rub it just a little bit with my blade
just to take that outside fleshy layer
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to give them that haircut,
cut them at the fattest part of the leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: flip them upside down, give them a nice 90
degree angle, give them a little scraping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I put it in my clone solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use clone X most of the time in most
facilities, in most applications that
[SPEAKER_00]: works for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do what works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody is going to send me an email and
tell me, I prefer this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You use the product that is working for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it that people have different
options and that different things work for
[SPEAKER_00]: different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You use whatever works.
[SPEAKER_00]: You dip your clone into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you put that clone into, in this
situation, we're going to go into a rapid
[SPEAKER_00]: router and that rapid router or a root
riot or whatever type of plug you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to use, they're all very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will all work in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever works for you again, you do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got 50 rapid routers in a tray and
that tray has an insert that keeps the
[SPEAKER_00]: rapid routers in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in 10 rows of five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that amount of clones per tray
because I can fill up two trays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's a hundred clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really efficient amount of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is those trays are designed to
have those plugs really closely so they
[SPEAKER_00]: can fit 50 of them into one tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots, the cubes work really well that
closely together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves up top kind of make a mess when
you have too many of them that leafy that
[SPEAKER_00]: closely together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get humidity issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get transpiration and respiration
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants that are on top of each other that
are resting on top of each other really
[SPEAKER_00]: have a lot of potential to cause problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if all day I just put my sweaty
arm right across your sweaty chest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just all day in the middle of the summer
in a clone dome, just sweating sticky,
[SPEAKER_00]: stagnant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get pissed off at my arm
in about five minutes, but you're a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't move it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to sit there and deal with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it is like if you've got them
too close together.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're all crushed together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing is they don't like being
crammed together like that and it will
[SPEAKER_00]: lead to problems down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: These clones are going to be in this dome
for probably 14 ish days, maybe 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe 20, depending on your experience,
depending on your cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a lot of options there,
but they're going to be in there for long
[SPEAKER_00]: enough time.
[SPEAKER_00]: To where we need to put some care into
this before we set ourselves up for
[SPEAKER_00]: failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the option to set yourself up
for success from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take all of the appropriate steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to cut the tips of the leaves
off because first it prevents the leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: from resting on each other too
ridiculously.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's enough foliage in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even after I do the trim, all that excess
foliage would just cause me problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm getting that out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am eliminating potential problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is another reason why I cut the
tips off of those leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the less leaf there is on that
plant is the less that there is to try for
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant to support.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant doesn't have a root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was living off of the root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's only way to live is through the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I said that I want to cut a bunch of
that leaf off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're like, wait, how's it going to
live?
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if you had 12 foot arms and you
had to hold the other six foot of your arm
[SPEAKER_00]: up all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your arm is going to get exhausted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to use all of your energy
just trying to hold your arms out all day
[SPEAKER_00]: long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that you've only got like probably two
something foot, my arms are long,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm six, five.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably got two foot long arms,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take a lot of energy to hold
those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to spend all of your
calories, all of your life source trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep your arms up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got less plant, it's just
less to sustain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is less stress on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant only has so much energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's not make it spend so much energy
keeping those leaves upright so it can
[SPEAKER_00]: survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just cut it to where they're short.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you notice when they're shorter,
they kind of want to stick up anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's trim them down a little bit and
help them survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to set ourselves up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by trimming those leaves, we kind of
minimize transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives us an advantage in the clone
dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think that when we cut those
leaves, that the plant goes into sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: panic mode and it sort of knows it's like,
hey, I better root because I'm getting all
[SPEAKER_00]: beat up up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I better start doing something down here
so that I can survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is a very fine line when cutting
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need enough leaf to keep a plant alive,
but we don't want to have too much leaf to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to sustain while we don't have a root
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need just enough leaf to keep the plant
functioning to where it can survive
[SPEAKER_00]: without a root system until it develops
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also don't need so many leaves that
that plant can't sustain those leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: without a root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very fine line.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also need to think about hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of those leaves and shoots contain
hormones that contribute to the function
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we leave some of the shoots and take
off the leaves, we will preserve hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will increase overall success
rate of our clones in our domes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a good idea to remove as much
leaf as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But be mindful that you are also taking
out hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a fine balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like everything we do in cannabis,
there is a balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a pro and a con.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always some kind of a balance and
you always have to find the fine line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time it is phenotype specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just have to develop a relationship
with your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants are really challenging to
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants will clone just by looking at
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can knock a cutting off and set it in
a cup of water and come back and the next
[SPEAKER_00]: day you got a whole fucking rooted plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are not that easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants really like to be cloned in a
rapid router and dome type of a setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants really prefer a turbo cloner
or easy cloner, an aero cloner type of
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it is very clone specific,
very strain specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to work on each specific
cultivar and get them figured out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes in a commercial environment,
I know which strains work well together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go in this dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll have a dome that is only
half full because it's a very specific
[SPEAKER_00]: strain that is just that I need 25 of
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do them by themselves so that
they have a better chance of surviving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they need to stay sealed up for a
few more days or they need to be open
[SPEAKER_00]: sooner or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that those need special attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will fill one dome with just that one
strain and treat it special on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be what you have to do to get
your clones to root.
[SPEAKER_00]: That puts me off on another side tangent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend Mr. Soul has recently reminded
us to start taking the domes off of our
[SPEAKER_00]: clones sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Soul and I see eye to eye on many
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In commercial facilities, I quite often
see clones in domes that the dome has been
[SPEAKER_00]: on there for far too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get that dome off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get those clones acclimated to the
environment, get them out of that clone
[SPEAKER_00]: situation and into some dirt much more
quickly if we start burping the clones
[SPEAKER_00]: sooner and start gradually getting them
used to that open environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then just remove the dome and let them
live in that tray for a couple of days
[SPEAKER_00]: with no dome and they will be OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's work on getting the clones off of
the domes earlier and we will see
[SPEAKER_00]: healthier starting baby plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is happening is they are trapped in
that environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't expand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their roots are stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pissed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not getting the appropriate
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start getting nutrient deficiencies
because they're just angry for being
[SPEAKER_00]: trapped in a little tiny dome in a little
cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's try to speed that process up,
get them out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, let's do what we can to
set ourselves up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day of every phase counts in this
new cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, since we're talking about clone
domes, I've got one more great thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: add to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were using an auto-cloner,
an easy-cloner, a turbo-cloner,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever kind of cloner you were using
that is an aero-cloner type machine,
[SPEAKER_00]: you do not need a dome on that clone
machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find it really silly to put a cloner on
that machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find it really detrimental.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of slows you down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does more harm than it does good.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were using a turbo-cloner,
an easy-cloner, whatever brand it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care if it's spraying from the
bottom and you're getting your roots
[SPEAKER_00]: misted from the bottom, you do not need a
dome on that cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take healthy cuts and you can
either cut the base of that cut at a 45
[SPEAKER_00]: degree angle or for an easy-cloner,
what I like to do is cut that clone right
[SPEAKER_00]: up the center of the stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't go too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a quarter of an inch is all you
need, right in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it looks like you just took your
forefinger and your middle finger that are
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you just go zip and just put a little
slit right between them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I think that when the water from that
easy-cloner sprays up there, it will start
[SPEAKER_00]: to roll those tips up and the roots will
grow out of that little slit that you just
[SPEAKER_00]: made.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see it, you'll say, holy shit,
that worked really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I like to cut a little slit right in
the middle of it, then dip it in my
[SPEAKER_00]: iUseCloneX.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about this earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use whatever solution you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use CloneX.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dip it in there, then I put it in a
Permaclone reusable clone collar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Permaclone doesn't pay me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think they're great because they're
reusable and I can fit two cuts in one
[SPEAKER_00]: collar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, quite often, you will find two clones
per clone collar when I'm using a
[SPEAKER_00]: Permaclone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you put it in the CloneX gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put it in your Permaclone clone
collar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You set it in the TurboCloner and you
forget it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got the nutrients in your
TurboCloner dialed in correctly and you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got your pH in your TurboCloner dialed in,
you will not have to put a dome over those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That AeroCloner should be spraying
constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do run into heat issues,
you can do a cycle where the pump is off
[SPEAKER_00]: and on for certain durations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give it time to cool so that the
water doesn't heat up too ridiculously hot
[SPEAKER_00]: because those pumps will heat up your
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the size of your Cloner and
your environment, you may need to give it
[SPEAKER_00]: a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have had great success running it 24
hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have had great success running it for
different intervals, maybe like 45 seconds
[SPEAKER_00]: on and 15 seconds off, maybe 30 minutes on
and 10 minutes off.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of different cycles have worked for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got to experiment to keep your
water cool, do the experiments that are
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back on track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the water spraying up from the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got the pH dialed in,
you've got your nutrient solution correct,
[SPEAKER_00]: you do not need to put a dome over those
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are going to be so happy about that
water spraying up their little butt that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just going to start dancing and
they're going to develop roots in seven to
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 days and these plants will be vigorous
and healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind, I keep saying this will
only work if your pH and your EC or PPMs
[SPEAKER_00]: are dialed in in your cloning machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have got to have the proper numbers in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have also got to maintain the proper
numbers in your cloning machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have got water creating a bubbly mist
all day long and spraying at the roots of
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants all day long in that machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hear it from across the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: All day long, that thing is moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water hasn't stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are going to get evaporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are going to get slight leaks out of
that machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody that has ran that machine knows
that there's going to be a drip from
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to lose water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, your plants are going to be drinking
some of that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are going to need to check on the
water level of that machine on a regular
[SPEAKER_00]: basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a commercial facility,
the first thing you should do when you get
[SPEAKER_00]: there is check on the cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the pump on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it making a funny noise?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it sound like it's spraying
correctly?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's spraying correctly, you've got to
risk just a couple of seconds of your life
[SPEAKER_00]: and lift it up and look in there and see
if any of the sprayers are clogged.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's a real bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get sprayed first thing in
the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're awake now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just lift that lid up and look and see are
all the clones getting sprayed?
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are, you're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got to unplug it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you get your EC meter or your PPM
meter, whichever one you're using,
[SPEAKER_00]: and your pH meter and just stick them
right in that nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: The machine is off at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take the lid off carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't break the bottoms of any of those
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you put your PPM or your EC meter
in there and your pH meter in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: just test that solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your numbers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is your pH in the acceptable range?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are your PPMs in the acceptable range?
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, adjust that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the water at the correct height?
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, correct that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a sticker on the front of my cloner
that shows when my cloner was last checked
[SPEAKER_00]: and who checked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have little stickers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just write your name, Rasta Jeff,
at 420 on Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that little sticker on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm accountable for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that on 420 on Monday, I checked
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The PPMs were cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: The EC was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the plants looked happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I have another sticker on there that
says RezClear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to put RezClear in my EasyCloners.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sure that I don't get any funky
algae or anything happening in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps my plants nice and healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put that in there every five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will write a little note.
[SPEAKER_00]: RezClear on Monday, January 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that on January 6th,
I know I need to put some RezClear in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my main point here is you don't need a
dome on your cloning machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That spray that comes from the bottom,
if your nutrients and your pH and your EC
[SPEAKER_00]: and your PPM and your water is not too
hot, if everything is dialed in,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to love getting sprayed from
the bottom and they do not need a dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are only slowing yourself down by
putting a dome on plants that are in an
[SPEAKER_00]: EasyCloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have to adjust them to the
non-domed environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't ever give them a dome,
they don't know what that life was like.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't ever need it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we put a dome on the clones
that are in the rapid rooters is because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not getting sprayed in their
little bums with constant fresh nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to kind of learn to develop
roots to get the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to eat from the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to eat from that humidity that
is kept in that domed environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is their only life source.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not getting a little bidet spray
to get tickled and kept alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is why I feel it is silly and
almost detrimental to your garden to put a
[SPEAKER_00]: dome on your clones that are in an
EasyCloning type machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got one more thing to talk about
and we are going to start wrapping up this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last part of this episode is I do not
find it necessary to put a dome on
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel the same thing about clones in a
clone machine as I do seedlings with a
[SPEAKER_00]: dome over them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that putting a dome over a
seedling will make that seedling a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want that seedling to grow in the
environment with the rest of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't need a dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think putting a dome on it is like
wrapping it up in bubble wrap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like nerfing my seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to put a fan on my seedlings where
it gets really strong and gets abused from
[SPEAKER_00]: the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want my seedlings to grow and to know
that they are not going to be babied.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them to come out and go,
ah shit, I better be strong or I just
[SPEAKER_00]: might not make it in this world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that may be different for me because
I've got experience and I have access to a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand that seeds are quite
expensive so people really want to baby
[SPEAKER_00]: them and not destroy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like by putting them in a dome
or putting a bag over the cup with the
[SPEAKER_00]: seedling in it, you're kind of slowing it
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're kind of giving it a participation
trophy and making it a little bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it would be better if we did
not put domes over the seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also do not like to use heat mats when
germinating seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that sometimes will make them
too hot and you do have the opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: roast your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got them in a paper towel in the
baggie and then you put them on a heat
[SPEAKER_00]: mat, you're going to cook them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that if you put them in a baggie
and a paper towel on a plate and on top of
[SPEAKER_00]: the refrigerator, that is more than enough
heat and you should have great success
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got one of those old school TVs,
a big box TV, who still has that shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got one of those old Sony
Trinitrons, the back of that bad bitch is
[SPEAKER_00]: the perfect heat to germinate your new
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a great episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like this rosin had me fucking
super rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I want to give a big shout out
to my friends over at Apothecary Farms for
[SPEAKER_00]: always taking great care of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the entire Pueblo crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the Springs crew and big

been removing cannabis-related accounts.

photographer, a cannabis enthusiast,

and you would like to find more
[SPEAKER_00]: like-minded friends, join us on Cannabuzz.

new community on Cannabuzz.
