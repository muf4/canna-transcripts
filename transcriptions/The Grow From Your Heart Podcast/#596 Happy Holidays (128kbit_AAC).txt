[SPEAKER_00]: Happy holidays, you bad motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 596 of
the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Christmas Eve episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're sipping some hot cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you got to eat some good food.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're surrounded by beautiful
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you got all of the gifts you asked
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most importantly, I hope your eyes are
as red as my Santa hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to start off this show by saying
thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Christmas is the season of giving and I
have been spoiled with generosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am overwhelmed with the generosity and
support which I have received from my
[SPEAKER_00]: community recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all started off with this beautiful
iRead genetics logo here behind me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to EZ057 for sending me that
artwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first Christmas gift I
received from the listeners and it means a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that was followed up by a pair of
custom Grow From Your Heart podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: drumsticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not know who this came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a package in the mail today and all
that was in the package was these
[SPEAKER_00]: drumsticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're wrapped in a little sleeve here to
keep them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says do a fat dab and give your mom a
hug for me on one stick and the other one
[SPEAKER_00]: says the Grow From Your Heart podcast with
iRead genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who sent these to me,
but this is a beautiful gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means the world to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcasting, growing cannabis, and playing
the drums are probably three of my top
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite things that I can talk about in
public.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly appreciate this gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is fucking perfect and it means a lot
to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be displayed where I see it
quite often because I really like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from the bottom of my big rasta man
heart, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to know who sent it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was nothing in the package except
these drumsticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was not a thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was not a Christmas card.
[SPEAKER_00]: No receipt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just know where it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came from the company that makes it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No details on who sent it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you sent me this, thank you and send
me a little note so I know who to say
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I don't know if this person wants
their name set on the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a beautiful gift in the PO box
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a handmade a hand knitted hat that
will fit my dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can wear this in a couple of different
styles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can fit the dreads up in there or I can
flip it up and have it more beanie style
[SPEAKER_00]: like the Santa hat that I'm wearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a beautiful gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate this because I can
tell this was handmade for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's big for my big old head and it is my
chosen colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell if you watch the show a lot,
you know I wear a lot of blues and a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of grays.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is blue and gray.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to match most of my outfit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of looks good with the shirt that I'm
wearing today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was not planned at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big thank you shout out to the friend
who sent me this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you want me to say your
name on the podcast but I do appreciate
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice and soft, nice and cozy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to fit me very well and it
smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some essential oils in it so it's
got a nice aroma to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice lemongrass flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should keep me nice and calm when I wear
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: These gifts do mean the world to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means a lot that you guys are compelled
and inspired to send me gifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've never met in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only know me through the show or
through social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to get gifts in the mail from you is
overwhelming and it means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seriously thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell a lot of jokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of a smart ass quite often.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time I'm being 100% serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: These gifts mean a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put a huge smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy holidays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy Hanukkah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Merry Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy Kwanzaa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever it is you celebrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you and happy holiday to you for all
of the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to say thank you to everybody
who gave me feedback on the live stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did use a different camera setting on
the last episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like that video came out
beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like the camera settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like those adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the lights right where I need
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've got the podcast kind of
dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's time to decorate around here and
do a little bit of stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you for all of the feedback,
all of the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the way that video came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This video will be edited on the brand new
Mac Mini.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Mac Mini finally made it here so this
video will be the first one that I edit on
[SPEAKER_00]: that Mac Mini.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to throw this video into iMovie,
my old editing software, and see how much
[SPEAKER_00]: faster the editing process is in iMovie
just because I want to compare the two
[SPEAKER_00]: computers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I see how much more quickly I can
process in iMovie, then I get to learn
[SPEAKER_00]: Final Cut Pro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So expect some video edits and
improvements in the video here in the near
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, bear with me and be patient with me
while I learn Final Cut Pro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've opened up that application one time
and there's a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a lot to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have no fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good at learning programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have watched me evolve and
watched me learn full-on video podcasting
[SPEAKER_00]: over the course of six or eight months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there have been a lot of changes and
there will continue to be more changes and
[SPEAKER_00]: improvements.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to get better from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for all of the words of
encouragement and all of the feedback on
[SPEAKER_00]: the last episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm looking for that again in the
future because I'm going to continue to
[SPEAKER_00]: make changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anything falls apart, if the audio
quality goes to shit, if the video starts
[SPEAKER_00]: sucking, if you don't like the show
because I'm not living up to my standards,
[SPEAKER_00]: say something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I rely on you guys to give me feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you say, hey bro, that video was
sloppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep me in check.
[SPEAKER_00]: I count on you guys for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some of you who are not shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll send me messages immediately and
let me know what you don't like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm confident in who I am and what I'm
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have constructive criticism,
I take it very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just going to tell me that I'm
ugly and to get some sun and shit like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, keep that to yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I need some sun, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's winter time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love some sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sell me a bag of sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll fucking rub it all over my face,
but it's like 20 degrees out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sun is hard to get right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm pale and pasty, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, don't get whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me words of encouragement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't keep telling me I'm pasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already know that, but thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, thanks to everybody who watched the
Cannabuzz Very Irie Christmas Special.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a huge response on Cannabuzz to the
Irie Genetics Rasta Jeff Very Irie
[SPEAKER_00]: Christmas Special that is still available
on Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Q Gros.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to JR Token.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did a wonderful job interviewing me
on that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of great questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I did a very good job myself,
not to toot my own horn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've evolved so far as a
podcaster that I'm so comfortable on a
[SPEAKER_00]: microphone that when I didn't have to host
that show, when I was just chilling out,
[SPEAKER_00]: answering questions, I feel like I really
got to have a good time, hang out with my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out once again to Q Gros and JR
Token from Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also thanks to everybody who watched
the Cannabuzz Very Irie Christmas Special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, big shout out to everybody who has
joined Cannabuzz in the past weekend or
[SPEAKER_00]: so.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing a huge spike in Cannabuzz
users and members, and I appreciate you
[SPEAKER_00]: jumping on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm not going to take a lot of
credit, but I mean, I talk about it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying to get people moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for finally following me over
to Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram has been shutting down accounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram has been deleting posts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're at it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once in a while, Instagram just decides
they need to clean up their shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go through and delete a bunch of
cannabis content.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also deleting a bunch of booty
pics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not relevant, but Instagram is
cleaning up, so it is time to jump over to
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join me on Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabuzz is a free social media
application where we encourage you to post
[SPEAKER_00]: your cannabis content.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't buy, sell, or trade cannabis
over there, but you can post your dab
[SPEAKER_00]: videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could post your plant pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could post your dried and cured bud
shots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything cannabis related, you can post
that on Cannabuzz, and we will not
[SPEAKER_00]: scrutinize you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We encourage you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram would have shut you down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want all that stuff that Instagram
would have shut you down for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So join us on Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, you can't buy, sell,
or trade cannabis, but you can get great
[SPEAKER_00]: advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be part of a great community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join the buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find us on Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: My notes are scrambled because I did not
go in order, and I just heard a weird
[SPEAKER_00]: noise in my house that we're going to hope
wasn't too disastrous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it didn't come through in the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: No idea what that was.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to find out in like an hour
what happened here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cannabuzz special.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave away some prizes on the Cannabuzz
special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those prizes, other than one order that I
don't have your address yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're watching this, I need your
address, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't sent your address from the
Cannabuzz contest, please send me your
[SPEAKER_00]: address.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get your last prize out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those prizes have been sent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are in the mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mail is broken right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The postal service, the UPS, and the
United States postal service are receiving
[SPEAKER_00]: 60% of an increase in package deliveries
this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't go shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't do most of our own shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't deliver gifts ourselves because
of this weird COVID situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the post office and the UPS and DHL and
FedEx are doing all of that stuff for us,
[SPEAKER_00]: but shit is running behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please be polite, passionate, patient,
courteous with all of the mail carriers
[SPEAKER_00]: and delivery people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the grocery people who are bringing
your groceries, even Grubhub, they deserve
[SPEAKER_00]: an extra high five, an extra tip,
at least a little extra patience with them
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deliveries are going to be late.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are going to be weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're waiting on a package in the
mail, don't stroke out over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have a panic attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in Ja's hands now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will get there when it's supposed to
get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the tracking numbers I've been looking
at say your package has been sitting at
[SPEAKER_00]: this place for three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything is at a standstill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is challenging right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, what I'm getting at is in the
Christmas time and the COVID time,
[SPEAKER_00]: we all need to be a little bit more
patient, more compassionate with each
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: With ourselves, with those that are around
us, especially the people that are doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: service for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gotten used to just expecting the
mail to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take that for granted.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mail person, the mail carrier,
has a family also.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to go home and smoke a bowl just
as bad as you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got shit to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not be a dick to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try to tip them and give them a
bonus where we can if we're able to in
[SPEAKER_00]: these weird times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make life easier for everybody right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to make shit harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life is hard enough right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of making life easier,
if you do celebrate Christmas,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't forget to leave out some milk and
cookies and a fat dab for Santa Claus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always good karma for next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we going from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got so much stuff written down and
I'm way off track on my notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the last episode, I talked about some
friends of ours that created an
[SPEAKER_00]: iRegenetics Discord page.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people then said, how do I get to
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I am brand new to Discord and I
haven't spent a lot of time on there
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm overwhelmed myself with
podcasting, with The Grow, with holiday
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just have a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not complaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like being busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being busy means that I've got stuff to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an income.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have not been on the Discord a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am brand new to Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am learning it just like you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing I can do to help you is I will
include the Discord link in this podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: video description.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people asked me, how do I find
Discord?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I posted the last show, I didn't know
how to find Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I've got a link for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put that in the show notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will be able to get to that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I do have a lot more rambling
to do, but this is the part where I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to give shout-outs to the 710 Club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the 710 Club are the folks who
support the show on Patreon at $7.10 a
[SPEAKER_00]: month or higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start off with a big Grow From
Your Heart podcast shout-out to a new
[SPEAKER_00]: supporter with a very unique name,
a name I will never forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a big shout-out to our friend,
Boner Soldier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Boner Soldier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout-out, Boner Soldier.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first question was, was that Major
Boner?
[SPEAKER_00]: Commander Boner?
[SPEAKER_00]: Captain Boner?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have way too much fun with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout-out to our friend, Boner Soldier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's follow that one up with a big
shout-out to Jesse Gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout-out, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just a podcast supporter, but a real
true friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse and I have known each other for
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude's from around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a really cool conversation the
other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ever think you're not in my history
book, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I write about cannabis history,
you are part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're from my neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are pioneers together, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout-out to Jesse Gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's follow that up with a thank you
shout-out to Frank Buckley.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a thank you shout-out to
Riven Waters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I said that correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be Riven Waters, Riven Waters.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you say it, I got nothing but love
and respect for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's follow that up with a thank you
shout-out to Nuggletron.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what a Nuggletron is,
but I want one for Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a thank you shout-out to Dolan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a thank you shout-out to Trium
Up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a thank you shout-out to
OP7420.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a thank you shout-out to
Virus Smurf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a thank you shout-out to Levity
Love Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last, but certainly not least,
let's send a big thank you shout-out to my
[SPEAKER_00]: friend D Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks and big shout-out to everybody
who supports the show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, if you're not already
supporting the show, all you have to do is
[SPEAKER_00]: visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow
from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of different tiers at
which you can support the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the tier that suits your budget the
best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sign up and contribute to the podcast,
and I'll give you a shout-out on the show
[SPEAKER_00]: if you join the 710 Club or higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you want to get your messages to
me directly, Patreon is the best way to
[SPEAKER_00]: get those messages on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read the Patreon messages first,
just to be fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for all the Patreon
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does mean a lot to me, especially
during these holidays.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys need to buy gifts for your kids,
your family, your mama, some of you your
[SPEAKER_00]: baby mama, some of you your baby daddy,
some of you your side chick and your side
[SPEAKER_00]: dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a lot of gifts to buy,
and if you're still able to contribute to
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast, that is awesome of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that money is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that things are rough out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Money isn't as abundant as it used to be,
so thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know that people are struggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know that people are working hard for
their money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to go somewhere you don't want to
be and deal with people you don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with and get told what to do by
somebody you probably don't want to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: some bullshit from.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably just want to go home and play
the new Xbox or play the new PlayStation
[SPEAKER_00]: and take a couple of dabs, spend some time
with your family, play with your puppy or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're stuck at work to make the money,
and then you spend some of that money on
[SPEAKER_00]: my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that is not lost on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the hell out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Straight-faced, big eyes, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff does mean a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that money is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to give them your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way to get money is to work,
and working isn't fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's called work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd rather be having fun, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for giving me the money that
you work for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to put it back into the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the fancy lights behind the
camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the dope-ass camera that I've
got.
[SPEAKER_00]: We painted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a new computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have bought me two computers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon has bought two computers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds crazy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said on a long time ago, like two years
ago, I said, hey, this computer is taking
[SPEAKER_00]: a shit, and it's hard to produce a
podcast, and I'm getting frustrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon contributions started pouring in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to pay for this MacBook right
here with Patreon contributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, this is my budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, this is the computer you
want for that budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This computer has lasted two years,
and it is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I upgraded to the 4K camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started dumping those 4K videos
into this computer, this computer started
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking and making weird noises.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, hey, I'm a good computer,
but you're asking a lot of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did some research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to a few of our tech nerds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Reefer Madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Tony.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to a lot of people that helped
me out, but they guided me toward the Mac
[SPEAKER_00]: Mini with the M1 chip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yesterday in the mail, I received a Mac
Mini with an M1 chip.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is set up now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's probably downloading updates
as we speak, but by the time we get done
[SPEAKER_00]: here, I'll get to go play with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to edit this video in that
machine like I talked about before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was from you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys covered the cost of that new Mac.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without you, that would not have happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have to have dug into my pocket
and pulled that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, that might not be in the
budget, because it's Christmas time,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I got to get gifts for all those
people we talked about before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon does mean a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your support does mean a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without you, we wouldn't have seen these
upgrades.
[SPEAKER_00]: The paint, the lights, the microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This mic was not cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm not trying to brag about
cost, but the Joe Rogan mic is...
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to buy into that club.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we going from here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2021 is coming, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2020 kind of, for a lot of people,
2020 kind of sucked real bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very blessed that I stayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't sink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't climb to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of stayed even keeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to keep my head to myself,
keep my head together, and not let myself
[SPEAKER_00]: get out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people had a rough 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year is almost over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping that this was the year of
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2020 is almost over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what I said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm reading and talking at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only human.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make some mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 2020 is almost over.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2021 is coming up brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, it's not jinxed or cursed or
whatever the fuck happened to this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, we get a fresh new year.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm getting at is you got to be good
all year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just be good around Christmas
time and hope for some good Christmas
[SPEAKER_00]: karma.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be good people 365 days a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was talking about being nice to the
postal workers, to the Postmates folks,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the Grubhub drivers, do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and see
how good you feel as a person.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're nicer to other people,
this weird little thing in the world comes
[SPEAKER_00]: back and makes the world nicer to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a podcast for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave out a bunch of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was super nice to a bunch of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I got a dope ass hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a cool painting and I got some brand
new drumsticks out of the deal just for
[SPEAKER_00]: being nice to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Karma goes in circles, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know sometimes you just want to cuss
somebody out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you want to fucking kill
somebody, kick something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you just want to throw some
dishes at somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to create that negative loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be a good person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try to shake all that shit off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go into 2020 with the most positive
outlook, positive attitude we can have
[SPEAKER_00]: because when you laugh at the dumb shit,
the dumb shit laughs back and goes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't get to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you create a little force field,
a little bubble of goodness around
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself and that little bubble of
goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only lets in goodness and it's
contagious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you rub up against some bullshit
with your goodness, you got the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to shine that bullshit with
your goodness and the bullshit can't get
[SPEAKER_00]: near you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike used to call it my jaw bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike noticed that I've got a little
protective karmic bubble around me because
[SPEAKER_00]: I do my best to be a good person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not fucking perfect, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told somebody to fuck themselves in a
text message the other day because they
[SPEAKER_00]: deserved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say what needs to be said,
but I do try to be the best person I can
[SPEAKER_00]: be at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, with that being said, 2021 is a fresh
year coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the time to set some goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time you're listening to this,
you've got a week until there's a brand
[SPEAKER_00]: new calendar year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to turn 2020 right behind us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be in the back of the
calendar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look 2021 right in the
face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have some goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have some preparations.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to do in 2021?
[SPEAKER_00]: What didn't you accomplish in 2020?
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you fuck up in 2020?
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you suck at this year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do that better next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's set some goals, have some
accomplishments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, while you're setting those goals and
looking for accomplishments and ways to
[SPEAKER_00]: realize that you are making progress in
your life, set some goals and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: know you're moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a goal, you may just
stand still and not even know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing something at level five,
let's get to six or seven next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing it at seven, let's be
level 10 by the end of 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's improve ourselves this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, with that being said, we've got to
adjust and adapt to this new way of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2021 is not going to be like 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be like 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people keep saying, I want the
world to get back to normal and I hate to
[SPEAKER_00]: be that guy, but this is the new normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're waiting for things to go back
like they were, you're fucking stuck and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's never going to be that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate to tell you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate to be that guy, but this is the new
world and we've got to adjust and adapt to
[SPEAKER_00]: what the world is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of your old plans, it is okay now to
go back and look at your goals and plans
[SPEAKER_00]: and scratch that shit out and say,
well, COVID, and replan everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be necessary to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't think that things are going to go
back to the way they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may get a vaccine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are going to have fucking conspiracy
theories about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to tell you where I
stand on that because I don't want the
[SPEAKER_00]: emails, but it's not going to be like it
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will get the vaccine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will get treated, but there's
always going to be a weirdness that
[SPEAKER_00]: stemmed from this situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The world will not be what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting older.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've got some foresight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been paying attention and I don't
think things are ever going to be like
[SPEAKER_00]: they were before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you are writing your goals,
when you're setting your plans and your
[SPEAKER_00]: expectations for 2021, remember that 2019
shit is not the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2021 is going to be way different because
2020 was fucking weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: So set yourself up for success in 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make some goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make some plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have personal goals?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have financial goals?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have business goals?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have career goals?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have family goals?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you helping somebody else reach their
goals?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're a husband helping a wife
start a new business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're a wife helping a husband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're a parent helping a child
develop something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you and your best friend are going
to start a new business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be the best partner and supportive person
you can be in 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's help each other out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get our shit together and help
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm rambling, but we've got to
have a plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have some financial goals?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have goals for what you're going to
do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have garden goals?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many crops are you going to turn in
your grow room in 2021?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it takes you 60 days to run a crop in
there, that's two months.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should get six crops out of that,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take you a little longer
than 60 days because most of our plants go
[SPEAKER_00]: 63, 65 should get 5.7 crops out of that
room, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to make that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to veg and flower and
then have more plants in veg to fill that
[SPEAKER_00]: flower as soon as it comes down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make some grow room goals and
schedules before the year starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a week to work on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to kick in in seven days from
the time you hear this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start getting prepared now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only garden goals, what are you going
to learn?
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you suck at this year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you not a good cloner?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you not good at identifying males?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you not good at scrogging?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you not good at putting up a trellis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get better at those things in 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: So set yourself up for success,
improve in 2021 and have some sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: plan and some sort of a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without plans and goals, I've said this,
we don't move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we do move forward, how do we even
know there's nothing to base it on,
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing to judge it on, nothing to guide
it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set yourself up for success and have some
sort of a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I think I've covered
all of the important notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have some sad news that I saved here
for the end of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been following a person for a really
long time on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before social media was a thing,
this person was a huge member of the
[SPEAKER_00]: forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person has been a big and an
important member of the cannabis community
[SPEAKER_00]: and has often been overlooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to give a huge moment of
silence and a moment of respect to a man
[SPEAKER_00]: known as Bog, the bushy old grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, damn, I'm gonna cry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bushy old grower passed away recently,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bushy old grower was a very inspiring
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's known as Bog Seeds, Bog Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've smoked boggle gum, that is from
Bog.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the things that Bog made were
bred into the current strains now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna give a short moment of
silence on a podcast here for Bog and then
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you what we're gonna do for
Bog's family right after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a moment of silence for my friend
Bog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rest in peace, bushy old grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll never forget you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now what we need to do is a
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, that shook me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we need to do is a community.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to help out Mrs. Bog.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a lot of medical expenses left
behind, there were funeral costs left
[SPEAKER_00]: behind, and Mrs. Bog is alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a GoFundMe page for Mrs. Bog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will include that link in the show
notes, the video description, so we can
[SPEAKER_00]: get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, I'm gonna cry for a second,
but I'm okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't prepare that, so that was fucking
real, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was what that was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for joining me for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there will be a link in the show so
that we can get Mrs. Bog some funding and
[SPEAKER_00]: some support because she's all alone now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine being married to somebody for 50
years and they're gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not gonna know what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're gonna need some help.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get Mrs. Bog some help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, that was harder to do than I thought
it would be, but that's real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Merry Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bad motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna wrap up this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I saved that for the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we gonna go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like this episode was
educational, informative, or entertaining,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'd like to make that financial
contribution to the show, once again,
[SPEAKER_00]: all you have to do is visit www.patreon
.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm gonna say is if you wanna
contribute this month, let's send that
[SPEAKER_00]: $7.10 or that $4.20 or that 100 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send that to Mrs. Bog this month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm okay, I'm fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mrs. Bog needs a hug and some funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So follow the GoFundMe in my video
description and let's help her out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry I'm crying, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about dead people on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially people that inspired us and
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would always see Bog at the events.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a booth at every Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The old guy with the ponytail and
sometimes he had a beard, sometimes he
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had his wife with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just Bog and Mrs. Bog at the booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the guy we lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a big part of the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big part.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't as outspoken and popular on
social media because he was an older dude
[SPEAKER_00]: that he was before social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't his thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when he did go on there, he always had
a smile, always had a good attitude,
[SPEAKER_00]: was always a good dude and always
encouraged us to breed with his gear and
[SPEAKER_00]: would tell you which plants to breed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd be like, don't use that one,
use that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a really good dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Bog, shout out to Mrs.
Bog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry you're gone and let's do our best to
support Mrs. Bog because being a widow has
[SPEAKER_00]: got to be one of the most challenging
things ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, patreon.com forward slash grow
from your heart or use that GoFundMe that
[SPEAKER_00]: I did put in the link to help out Mrs.
Bog.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got any questions, corrections,
comments, concerns, words of
[SPEAKER_00]: encouragement, anything like that,
I love hearing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is

[SPEAKER_00]: Do not be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me anything you'd like to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll answer your questions, I'll help you
out, give you guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be patient though.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just one of me and there are
thousands of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm backed up on messages, but I do about
twice a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take a fat dab and I just sit in front
of the computer and I try to answer as
[SPEAKER_00]: many as I can until my ADD kicks in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, answering emails is one of the
most boring things for my brain to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I have to focus in and do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try, you guys, I really try.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I find myself, I just get up and
walk away and I'm in the garden suddenly
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm like, oh, I was answering emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: ADD, ADD, you just saw ADD in full effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, don't forget to visit my website,
iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All things Rasta Jeff, iregenetics,
grow from your heart will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, that was my quick
Christmas episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I covered a lot of ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went from smiles to cries right back to
smiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for joining me for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna edit any of this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going out just like it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna go put it in the new Macbook or
in the new Mac and see what Garage or
[SPEAKER_00]: iMovie does to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how long it takes me to post it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm gonna hopefully get some more
podcasts done on that machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm rambling, but this was a great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for me to take some dabs at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for you to get back to your
family.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not hanging out with some
family, jump on a Zoom video, hang out
[SPEAKER_00]: with some friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that Eagle is on right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could go watch Eagle.
[SPEAKER_00]: He never signs out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If Eagle's not on, Fumidor is on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody is on Zoom on YouTube right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can watch them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may be in somebody's chat right now
hanging out just as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Late at night, I jump in those chats and I
hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is such a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, it's time for me to go because
I'm obviously rambling and need a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a big shout out to my
friend Bog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next time, take a fat dab and give
your mom a hug for me.
See you next time.
