[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been taking dabs of gunslinger remix
live batter from green dot labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of star fighter and star
dog on the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is described as sour fruit and
fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I agree with all of those flavor
and aroma combos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really enjoying the buzz from the
gunslinger remix batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time when I hit a dab,
I feel like I get nice and high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke myself into a panic attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to smoke until my eyes are bugging
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm jittery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm looking around the room kind of
giggling a little bit got a silly look on
[SPEAKER_00]: my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I smoke the gunslinger, it does the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me chill the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me sit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me slow down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I really needed a nice chill
out concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our friends at green
dot labs for the perfect gunslinger remix
[SPEAKER_00]: live batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright podcast world in this episode,
I'm going to read a little rant that I
[SPEAKER_00]: wrote that was intended for a social media

that I want to kind of read and turn into
[SPEAKER_00]: a rant for you.

[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I did include a link in the
show notes and in the video description to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it easy for all of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a couple of things I want to
ramble about before we jump into the main
[SPEAKER_00]: topic of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of you guys that follow guys and gals
that follow the show know that I have been
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding with a Jack the Ripper male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a very small breeding area that
I've dedicated to a Jack the Ripper
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some seeds of Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a beautiful male in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That male has pollinated several select
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about a lot of the ladies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pollinated on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of Jack the Ripper
females in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a blueberry cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what else I have revealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll say today that there is a platinum
tangy in there that also got pollinated by
[SPEAKER_00]: the Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may have been a grateful dog in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm revealing more today on the show
than I think I have in the past,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there should be some wonderful crosses
coming from a Jack the Ripper male in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, in my humble opinion,
these plants look amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my first breeding run under LED
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the LEDs are making the plants look
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves look thicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves feel healthier, fatter,
thicker, more lively.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just more leaf there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves used to feel, I would say they
used to feel like one sheet of paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm kind of comparing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say there are about two,
maybe three sheets of paper thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are two pieces of paper thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are much thicker, much more robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just seem healthier.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more vibrant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have better colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants just appear healthier and
happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a grower who's been growing for a
hundred years, a lot of crops under my
[SPEAKER_00]: belt, a lot of different strains and
different genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the plants look overall happier
underneath the LED lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they like that bright yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you like that bright yellow light from
the HPS?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think the plants are digging it
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my photos look way better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to manipulate my photography
because I'm getting photo quality lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: on my plants already when I go to take a
photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants are looking much better
underneath the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited with the growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds seem to be hardening up quite
quickly as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds are fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds that I can see in the buds are
fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being a breeder, the way that I test to
see how far along the seeds are,
[SPEAKER_00]: how close to being ready they are,
I'll find a seeded bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just pull a couple of parts right off
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of pods, a couple of calyxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say a couple of seeds right
off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pick them right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see them, shake them out of the
calyx, rub the calyx off of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: rub the outer coating off and the seeds
will fall in your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell the ripeness, the maturity of
that seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds that are coming out of these
plants are not done quite yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they are fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, they're looking huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got some good color, some good
stripes going on on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited for these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else I've noticed, it was 102
degrees today.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I would have been running my normal
thousand watt HPS light in that room where
[SPEAKER_00]: these two Canon LEDs are, it would have
been too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It simply would have been too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting as much performance as much
plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have as much seed, as much biomass
from two 325 watt LEDs that I was getting
[SPEAKER_00]: from a thousand watt HPS light and the HPS
light required more cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ran hotter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made the electric bill higher and my
plants didn't enjoy it as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am really convincing myself that in a
home environment, LEDs may be the way to
[SPEAKER_00]: go for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't send me an email saying that you
hate me because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be the way to go for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to make the disclaimer in a big
commercial grow in a giant space,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still set on using double-ended
Gavitas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that for my commercial grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my way, but in a home grow
environment and a small environment and a
[SPEAKER_00]: personal production situation,
a small breeding project area,
[SPEAKER_00]: some Canon LEDs are the way to go in my
opinion at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep talking about these Jack the Ripper
crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a known seed breeder and a seed
seller.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not ready yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do need to make the disclaimer every
time I talk about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not ready yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't be done for probably 15 to 25
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm guessing I have to pay attention to
the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a new project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how long the seeds are going
to take to finish up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to pay attention when they are done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll harvest the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've given this rant before you guys takes
two weeks to dry, more time for me to get
[SPEAKER_00]: to it, more time to package it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then friends of mine will grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then maybe you'll get a chance to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you guys want these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew them to get them out to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me make sure that they're worth a shit
before I send them to you so I don't waste
[SPEAKER_00]: your time, space and energy in your
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a good way to segue into the rant
that I've got prepared for the show before
[SPEAKER_00]: I get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me give a giant shout out to my friend
Keith at Black Sale Market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running his Canon LED lights and I
haven't been more, I don't know what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: word.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited, but there's a better word for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't wanted to share my success with
a product like I do the LEDs in a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of toys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I buy a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I experiment with a lot of products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I buy products at the growth store just
off the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go and people are like, we would have
given you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I know, but I'm a consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to consume it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give you money and support your
company and keep your things going.
[SPEAKER_00]: My point is I buy a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't talk about all of it on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only talk about shit that really makes
me happy, really makes me skip hop and
[SPEAKER_00]: jump.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got new millennium nutrients and Canon
LED lights are the latest things that made
[SPEAKER_00]: me do cartwheels in my growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made me say, damn, that really made a
difference and was worth the investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my ass kissing for Black Sale
Market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not kissing their ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do appreciate the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I paid for the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will buy more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend those lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure they've got a website,
blacksailmarket.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably I should have been more prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do follow them on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to you, Keith.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't wait to hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I was talking about transitioning into
the main topic of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost my train of thought, but we can get
right into here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm scrolling through and honestly,
it drives me crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the things that I see on social
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of why I started this podcast is
because people ask, Hey, why do my plants
[SPEAKER_00]: look like this on social media?
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody's got a simple problem,
but then somebody will respond with,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, have you thought about, maybe you've
got this kind of fungus or maybe you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got this kind of a fit or maybe you've got
this kind of might.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is not the issue at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now you've put that idea into that
person's head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now instead of solving the simple
issue they started with, they're also
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get rid of the fungus,
get rid of the mites and correct the other
[SPEAKER_00]: problem that you invented for them because
there are new growers and they're paranoid
[SPEAKER_00]: and you just put these ideas in their
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a lot like WebMD.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at your plant, you got a small
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go, Oh no, small discoloration on two
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to look up what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go ask Facebook, Hey, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very similar to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I got a small pain right here
underneath my rib, it just feels weird
[SPEAKER_00]: when I breathe in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if I move my right arm, you go fucking
Google that and WebMD tells you,
[SPEAKER_00]: ah, you've got cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got seven kinds of AIDS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your eyes are going to come out and you're
going to die before the sun comes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, Facebook and social media
sites are the same fucking thing for grow
[SPEAKER_00]: advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say I've got a couple of little yellow
spots and somebody says, you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: thrips, spider mites, aphids and plant
herpes all at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to use plant therapy,
spray it with rubbing alcohol and then
[SPEAKER_00]: feed it a cup of piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, um, what, what are you guys
doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that shit drives me crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to go on social media sites and
Facebook and things to give helpful
[SPEAKER_00]: advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a lot of resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want good, helpful advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want bickering and rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see me less on the social media
sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see me more here doing this sort of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where it needs to happen to me for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here is something that I saw a lot of
happening on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the most current thing that people
are talking about and experiencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to jump right into my
notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too many people have failed to do pre
selection before putting their plants
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of people with giant plants
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been growing for months.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got these giant bushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are as big as me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're proud.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're standing next to it with their
thumb up with their armor on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, look at my big ass plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spend a lot of money on nutrients and
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They built these cute little outdoor beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They built a nice protective barrier to
keep animals away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been defoliating.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've popped them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've twisted them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've trained the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants look sexy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look fucking marvelous.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been working on them since like
May.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been outside working on them since
like April.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some places, they put them out real
early if they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been working on them indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been defoliating, twisting,
topping, popping, manipulating,
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking training these plants,
treating it like a fucking prize pony
[SPEAKER_00]: going to the state fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: A prize horse, prize cow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prize cow going to the state fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was not my realm at all, but they
took good care of this plant, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's August, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these people are realizing they
put male plants outside and they've taken
[SPEAKER_00]: care of them for months.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spend a bunch of time, energy,
money on useless and potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: problematic plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Problematic is a word that I wrote down
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potentially problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only did you waste time, energy,
money, space, if it's illegal,
[SPEAKER_00]: you wasted the fucking sweat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's, if it's an illegal area,
it's a whole new realm growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole new level of stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start acting weird to your friends and
your family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you got that fucking crime in the
backyard or wherever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, you just wasted a bunch of
time growing a male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wasteful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, why do I say it's potentially
problematic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're not only going to pollinate
your other plants with that male,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you've got neighbors in that area,
in that neighborhood within four or five
[SPEAKER_00]: miles, maybe even a little bit further,
I'm not certain on pollen travel,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you've got enough pollen and you've
got neighbors that are growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to pollinate their crop as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's hemp, if it's cannabis,
your pollen will go pollinate a crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're going to mess up somebody
else's crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody, if a hemp farmer was making
hemp seeds, now he's got a cross with you
[SPEAKER_00]: that he didn't, he didn't want to collab
with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't trying to make a seed company
with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wanted his cross with his males and his
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also his pollen probably would have gotten
to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fuck him too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now you've done pollination on other
people's crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've contaminated other people's gardens
that they worked hard for.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did the proper steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't put males out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did the proper auditioning process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's something that I want to segue
into.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to be more careful when
planting seeds outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see new growers buying seeds and putting
them outside and just hoping for the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does work, but you're going to get
male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get problematic plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to find phenotypes that are
undesirable for outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to have the best that you
could possibly do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way to set yourself up for success is
to audition your plants before you give
[SPEAKER_00]: them the big stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what do I mean by that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, don't run big plants outside until
you find out if they are male or female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't run big plants outside until you
find out if they are worth a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't run big plants outside until you
know if they are 65, 70, 80 day flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that plant takes 120 days to flower,
why are you going to put it outside in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when October comes around,
we're going to get snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need some sort of
coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need some sort of heater.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take a lot more work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want that out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant won't be done till New Year's,
maybe next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to fuck with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need something that finishes in 60,
70 days so we can get it around Halloween,
[SPEAKER_00]: get it indoors, get it taken care of and
start smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get back on my notes here because
it felt good to get on a rant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I want to stay on track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So expect variation when you buy seeds,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done rants on phenotypical variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you buy a seed pack, not all seeds
will be the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the filial generation of the
seeds you are sold, there may be wide
[SPEAKER_00]: variation in those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be very similar traits in
those seeds, but there will be variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, they could be males.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be females.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know unless you bought feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have no way to be sure if you've got
males or females.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if you did buy fems, I make
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will back my product, but who knows how
other people are making their fems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they'll harm on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you got problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend running them indoors,
then veg them big enough to get a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as soon as your clone's root,
flower the big plants or flower the clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your option.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can talk about that and then find out
if you've got males or females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out if you've got plants that are
worth the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when the time comes, put those good
plants outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people jump the gun and say,
well, I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people jump the gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people jump the shark.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people fucking fuck the goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just bought seeds and put them
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see people who spent a lot of money on
building nice outdoor grow setups.
[SPEAKER_00]: They amended a lot of really nice soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did a lot of great shit, but they
failed to select proper seeds or plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: put outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've already lost more than half or
more than a third of their crop because
[SPEAKER_00]: they had to go pull males.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as it started getting a little bit
light out a little bit earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: males started popping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd wake up in the morning and go,
oh shit, there's a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're walking the rows, pulling half
their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they did not prepare properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way to do that is to audition them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Audition them before you give them the big
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them in the little grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have a lot of risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once you found some good plants,
put those outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get back onto the process of how
to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, run your seed, get your small
plant, grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you can get a clone,
take a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not good at taking clones,
get the top out of the plant as a clone
[SPEAKER_00]: and the bottom two branches and leave the
rest of the plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take good care of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Repeat that process for every seedling
that you have popped.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've done five seeds, do it five
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have 15 clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've popped 20 seeds, do it 20 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have 60 clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you've got clone space and veg
space for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, this is going to require a
room to do this in or in which to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one, maybe two spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll need to keep the original mom plant
alive and you'll need to flower out
[SPEAKER_00]: another plant some more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to need a veg space and a
flower space, but they do not need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: big.
[SPEAKER_00]: So veg out your seed, get a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as those clones begin to root,
flower out one of, you can flower out the
[SPEAKER_00]: big plants or you can flower the clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is your choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are pros and cons of both of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you flower out the smaller plant that
you've cut a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you cut a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can root them as soon as you can
flower that you can put the clone dome
[SPEAKER_00]: under 1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put your cloning machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under 1212 lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within 14 days, those clones will show
you what are males and females.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to do it that way,
cut your clones, let them root.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as they root, you can either fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would flower the big plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're already grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're large.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually have a productive crop
from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see what your phenotypes look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see what you've got male and female
wise, and you'll find the phenotype that
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to put outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got clones in the clone
dome as a backup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after you flower that you found the
champion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've taken your clone, plotted that into
another pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got them labeled clone A,
plant A, clone B, plant B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've select your keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when it comes time to put them
outside, you put the good one outside,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just the whole pack and hope for the
best.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put 10 clones of your favorite plant
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me catch up because I feel like
I've gotten ahead of myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the option when you take clones
and you're going to pick which one to
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can flower out that big plant or you
can flower out the clone, the pros and
[SPEAKER_00]: cons, the pros of flowering out the big
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking ready to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a flowering space,
run it, turn it and burn it, flip it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's find out what we've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take notes, take pictures, see which
keeper, which phenotype is the keeper for
[SPEAKER_00]: you and keep that fucker around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a clone of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow that clone out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you took three clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got one you can mom out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can flower one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can play with another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep one as a mom or you can use
them both and make a bunch of clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got options, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pros of flowering the big one is
you've got a big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pros of flowering the small one is it
doesn't take a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little tiny plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that in a very small
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can run 48 cups, little tiny cups and
just get little tiny plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can run 48 of those under one small
light in very small space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you keep them watered properly and pay
good attention to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can also keep that many clones
alive in another space to have backups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grow your plant, get a clone,
flower out either that big plant or the
[SPEAKER_00]: clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out which one you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep one or the other around so you've got
a backup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is your new mom at your clone
preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Select your keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then put the keeper outdoors when the time
is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've ran it one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can put it outdoors when the time
is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know that you're going to have a
quality plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you get a clone before you put
it outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always make sure you have a clone before
you flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you've got a rooted clone before
you put the next plant into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always have that clone as preservation or
you may lose your genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to do a revedge, which is a
whole new podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of your decision based on if you
want to flower that big plant or that
[SPEAKER_00]: little plant may be based on space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a lot of space,
flower out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it depends on where you're keeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a lot of veg space,
keep the big plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a lot of veg space,
keep the little plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a lot of flower space,
flower the big ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a little flower space,
flower the small ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is your decision to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower one side, keep the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then select your favorite one and you can
toss all of the other plants if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to, or just grow them one more
time since you've already got them,
[SPEAKER_00]: flower them out, get some product off of
them, or just toss them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you keep a clone of your
favorite keeper all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to take a clone of that one,
label it fucking plant number 25 keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got that keeper in the
corner all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is your new mom plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime you want to grow that,
you can go get clones of her.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can run it indoors, run it outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can breed to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can share it with friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Develop a relationship with that clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn how much CalMag it wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn exactly how long it takes to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn if it likes it cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn if it likes it hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dial it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Develop a relationship with that one
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So veg, get a clone, then flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to catch myself up on notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took too many excessive notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you were doing the phenol hunt,
when you were running these tester plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: do the same thing to all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do any weird shit to one plant that
you don't do to the other plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a selection process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to know, we want to treat them all
equal so we know which one we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do something weird to plant A and
you don't do it to plant B, how do you
[SPEAKER_00]: know which one of them is going to do
better under different circumstances?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way I like to do a phenol hunt,
people ask me, do you top them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to run them small and fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason to grow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are brand new seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not trying to make production off
the first run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your first run is not production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your first run is for selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then off of those selections, we will run
a profitable production run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to clear my throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys hang on for one second.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we'll pop a pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fun to say, say that really quickly
and then grow them all really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your clone, flower something out as
quickly as possible and find out if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: worth the shit to keep growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out which is your keeper and
eliminate your boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you don't waste a bunch of time
and space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out now instead of outside in August
after you've been vegging since April.
[SPEAKER_00]: So audition your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it like a pack of baseball cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to find that Mickey Mantle or
think of it like magic cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to find that whichever one you're
looking for, that rare card you're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also keep in mind, you may have to go
through a bunch of land cards to get to
[SPEAKER_00]: the cards that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't put untested plants outdoors is
my main advice, unless they are feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds from a reputable breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, autos are cool if they are fems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not an auto flower guy, but I should
add in there that auto flowers are cool
[SPEAKER_00]: for outdoors if they are fems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're an experienced grower and
you want to fuck around and put some seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: outside and risk running males and you
know what you're doing, you understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: risk, you know how to plant extra plants
to cover up for the loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like you've got the experience
and you can identify the male plants
[SPEAKER_00]: before they become problematic in your
garden, before they pollinate your garden
[SPEAKER_00]: or somebody else's garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like that's something you can
be responsible for and you're experienced
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to do that, go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm talking about are the people
that were very unprepared and didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: realize they were going to get male plants
outdoors this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that didn't realize they were going
to get 20 foot tall plants outdoors this
[SPEAKER_00]: year when their privacy fence was only six
feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm talking about audition your
plants, do that phenohunt and find the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate keeper for your situation
before you put it outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know that may not be feasible for a
lot of people, but if you're not able to
[SPEAKER_00]: do that, you've got to take into
consideration that you're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get males, you're going to
get different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not all going to be uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more thing I want to talk about that
I've seen on social media frequently is
[SPEAKER_00]: that a lot of people got way overzealous
and put their plants outside way too
[SPEAKER_00]: early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their plants went from a grow room where
they were vegging, then they put them
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if it was because they
went from that grow light schedule to
[SPEAKER_00]: outside and the light was just right or
just wrong and the plants went into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people put their plants out
too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: They began to go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the season changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plants began to revege and people
started freaking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the plants went back into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we are approaching August.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are beginning to flower again.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have some really weird
looking plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When plants begin to revege, they start
making extra shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves start doing weird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it on social media quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: People put their plants out as soon as it
started looking warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: People started putting their plants out as
soon as it started looking like it was
[SPEAKER_00]: warm outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some places that's acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the plants went into flower a little
bit early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those folks faced a revege situation and
their plants look really stressed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a few things that could have
caused the early flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants came from indoor conditions to
outdoor conditions and they just weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: sure what you expected from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it went into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I've been inside under 20 hours
of light or 24 hours of light or 18-6.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now am I here in the sunshine?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of weird and I'm not sure
what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since I'm a plant and my only goal is
to reproduce and I'm kind of freaked out,
[SPEAKER_00]: watch me flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it just went into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, sometimes the light cycle outside
was just right or just different enough
[SPEAKER_00]: from the indoor light cycle that it
triggered the plant to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you came from that 18-6 or that 24
and you went outside and there was only 14
[SPEAKER_00]: hours of light or 12 hours of light,
it was like, Hey, that's enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in there in vege.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they just moved me to a flower
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it went into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just freaks out and it goes into
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it went back into vege because the
outside light, it finally realized,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what, this outside lights up for
a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I should go back into vege.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys just kind of freaking your plants
out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it just, you could tell that it's
going to freak out the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what will happen is people assumed that
because they saw more than 12 hours of
[SPEAKER_00]: light outside that the plants would stay
in vege.
[SPEAKER_00]: But outside is a little bit of a different
game because of the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did, it did appear that there was more
than 12 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like there was 14 or 15 hours of
light outside, but as the sun begins to
[SPEAKER_00]: set, it puts off, I don't understand
exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to use the right terms and
people are going to call me on that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but let me just do it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the sun set, it creates a red spectrum
in the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: That red spectrum triggers, it is a far
red light and that far red triggers
[SPEAKER_00]: phytochrome in the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that phytochrome tells the plants,
Hey, it's time to go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the sun sets, it creates a red
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: That red spectrum tells the plants that it
is sleepy time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start sleeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though we still see sunlight with our
eyes, the sunlight is still up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That red spectrum is so powerful to the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like hypnotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like sleep and they just went,
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they went to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as the sun rises, it puts off a blue
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is basically the finger snap.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I snap my fingers, you'll be plants
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they wake up and they start
going, Oh, good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that red puts them to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That blue wakes them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did appear that there was enough
sunlight, enough hours of daylight outside
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep the plants awake.
[SPEAKER_00]: But wherever you were, your situation,
you're part of the equator, you're part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the globe, the part of the sun,
your environment, that environment told
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants, Hey, the red wants you to go
to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've only had this many hours in the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that will trigger plants to go into
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also plants have what is known as a
critical period.
[SPEAKER_00]: That critical period is the amount of
darkness that triggers the plants to go
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can vary from plant to plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we do 12-12 in a commercial
grow or in a grow environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: the home grow environment is because that
is the cycle that we have learned that
[SPEAKER_00]: triggers nearly every plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants may go with a shorter dark
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some may take a little longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some of those sativas, they could use
a darker cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I recommend 11-13 on some
strains later in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It speeds them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 12-12 is just what we have established
as growing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what we've bred towards.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what we've been playing within our
gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what all of our lights have been set
to for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's what we've bred it for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are some cultivars, some
phenotypes that their critical period may
[SPEAKER_00]: be 14 hours of daylight and they will
begin to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on what part of the
equator, what part of the planet that seed
[SPEAKER_00]: and its genetics did come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is why a lot of people's plants
went into flower too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why people's plants started to
revege.
[SPEAKER_00]: They started spitting out weird shaped
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They started making weird shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They started to show pistols and then they
reveged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are like, are these herming on
me?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they were not going herm on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were not hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were reveging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they got back into their normal
reveging.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're back into veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then nature went, oh, but wait,
it's flower season now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the light cycle actually started
reducing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the plants went back into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if the video just saw me push
the mic out of my face on accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the plants went into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going to be struggle plants the
whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me catch up on my notes because I
did make a lot of notes and I just skipped
[SPEAKER_00]: over a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got ranting and I enjoyed that more than
following the notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because of this phytochrome red,
because of the far red spectrum,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is what is causing the plants to
trigger their flowering cycle a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier than we anticipated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did see that light was 14 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at the farmer's almanac.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said sunrise and sunset.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had 16, 14, maybe 13 hours in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are the plants flowering?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of their critical period,
because a far red light and because of
[SPEAKER_00]: phytochrome red.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that kind of answered my own
question to my own rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't put untested seeds outside
unless you are able to identify and cull
[SPEAKER_00]: male plants before they become
problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you're using femme seeds,
that is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to test those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still keep an eye on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Femme seeds can be problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do make femmes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get reports of problems in mine,
but I do see problems in femme seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how they are made.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how the parents are
selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may find problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I said it before, auto flowers are
cool outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's your thing, do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to run femmes,
I recommend that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if you're going to do autos and
they're not femme, please pay attention
[SPEAKER_00]: for the male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my next piece of advice is be
more careful when you're putting your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be more prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put them out too early,
they may go into flower too early,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on your location on the planet,
the equator, where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern, southern hemisphere could affect
your planting and flowering times.
