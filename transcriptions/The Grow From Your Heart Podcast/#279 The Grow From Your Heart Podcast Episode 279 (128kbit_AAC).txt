[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 279 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist, or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots band, letting use their music on my
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Kat, Coot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I am dabbed the fuck
out today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a happy Saturday afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been super cold in Colorado,
but today it is a nice sunshiny day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still like 50 degrees out there,
but that's nice for what it is right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am taking some dabs of some Durban
Poison Live Resin from CSC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the concentrate supply company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked it up over at Three Rivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super saucy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some crystals in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes freaking amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked almost a whole gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked it up last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked a bunch of dabs out of it last
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked a bunch of dabs out of it today
on Instagram Live.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be gone as soon as this podcast
ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to finish it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super delicious Durban Poison Sativa dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got me rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got my head spinning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started off the day just like I woke up
alone at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nobody here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just like lazy and bored.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Saturday.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I got to get my fucking head
woke up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had some food and got myself moving,
chilled out for a little while,
[SPEAKER_00]: handled some chores, did some house stuff,
and then I went and got on Instagram Live
[SPEAKER_00]: and took a bunch of dabs with everybody on
Instagram Live, and that really got my
[SPEAKER_00]: brain moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Durban Poison dabs and the interaction
on Instagram Live really got my brain
[SPEAKER_00]: firing in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It worked perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks to everybody who is joining me
on Instagram Live.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys that don't follow me on
Instagram, I really think you should.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's irey underscore genetics on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I-R-I-E underscore G-E-N-E-T-I-C-S on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do Instagram Live videos occasionally
and go and talk about whatever's going on
[SPEAKER_00]: with my day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take some dabs and I ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: People ask questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I answer those questions in the
live feed, but then I'll come back and
[SPEAKER_00]: record them and answer them on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the questions for today
actually came from an Instagram Live feed,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we'll get to that in just a couple of
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else are we going to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, remember I talked a couple of
weeks ago about getting sick?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ever since I got sick, when I take dabs,
I have just been getting wrecked high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably smoke half as much hash in the
past few days as I used to before I got
[SPEAKER_00]: sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just had this killer chest cold and
a head cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody at the Grove got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It passed around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody around here got sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since then, I've just been able to get
stupid high just off of a couple of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of not also because my friends
will be like, here's a big ass dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll take it and be like, I just got
to sit here for 10 minutes and figure my
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking life out again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've just been getting lit off dabs
lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's got anything to do
with when I was sick or if I'm eating a
[SPEAKER_00]: little differently because I got sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, when you get sick,
you try to be a little more healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start eating better and you're like,
I got sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I better eat more fruit and cut out all
the crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm doing that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's got something to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But holy crap, I've been getting lit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: My eyes have been getting red again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I want to mention,
my favorite rig got real dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I switched over to an even smaller rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hitting the Hitman phase two.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little tiny rig, the phase two with
the thermal banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the small rigs, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of people smoking out of big
gigantic dab rigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bong, when you're smoking a bong,
you're trying to fill all that glass
[SPEAKER_00]: space, that whole chamber with smoke so
that when you pull it, you get this big
[SPEAKER_00]: old blast of smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you choke and your eyes turn red.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking awesome, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a big old bong rip.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're taking a dab, I don't want to
smoke a liter of oxygen before my dab gets
[SPEAKER_00]: to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to heat the nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to let it get still towards a
little bit too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: For most people, I like my dab's hot,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People talk shit, but I'm a hot dab
smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to get towards just still a little
bit too hot, then I put my dab in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I cap it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that dab goes from the nail
through the water, poof, into my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just like a punch to the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like there's no need for all the
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just need some bubbles to percolate and
cool down the smoke a little bit before it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets to my throat because it'll burn your
throat if you don't cool it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to smoke dabs out of
something without water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need some water filtration, some
bubbles, but I like straight from the nail
[SPEAKER_00]: through the water, through the mouthpiece,
punch me in the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I want my dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are smoking out of big rigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Downsize.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what it does to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a little tiny rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how much better it works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been giving you breeding updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a small breeding project going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got a Stardog female, a Durban
Poison female, and a Platinum Tangy
[SPEAKER_00]: female, plus a couple others in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are the three we're going to
talk about right now that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinated by King Solomon, which is an
Arise male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise is the golden goat female crossed to
a Daybreaker male that made Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: The females at Arise have tested as high
as there's been 35% consistent tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been 32% consistent tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's 32% THC, 35% THC coming from the
Arise females.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a male that performs well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love the shape and structure and
the aroma that comes from that male.
[SPEAKER_00]: It flowers in a great amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like this male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes great progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have pollinated the Stardog,
the Durban Poison, the Platinum Tangy,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a couple other select females.
[SPEAKER_00]: With this Arise, today is Day 45 of
flowering for those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got pollinated about 25 days into
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they will be ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's say it's got 45 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got about 15, maybe 20, 25 days until
those seeds are ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll chop down the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first we'll cut off all the big
leaves, chop down the plants, let them
[SPEAKER_00]: hang upside down and dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll cut them into smaller
pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll crunch them up into a little
Tupperware dish and get all the seeds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll grow a bunch of those and
see what I have created.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I'm pretty excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stardog is a great commercial strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great yielder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a nice rock hard dense buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells real good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes amazing photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the smoke and the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a nice head high to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does what I want from medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think crossing it to the Arise,
which also smells good, tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does this eye thing when I smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise makes my eyes feel real heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I miss that in weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the new weed doesn't have the eye
high that the old weed had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think by crossing the two, I should
really make some I'm hoping to improve the
[SPEAKER_00]: harvests of the Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping to put that Arise vigor into
the Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping to get that cushy smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping to get a lot of trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping to get a lot of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to that one a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Durban poison was the other one that I was
excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just dabbing the Durban poison live
resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the flavor of Durban poison,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is amazing, but also the high
from Durban poison, that sativa head thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people, if you would have smoked
as much Durban poison hashes, I just
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked the live resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just call all concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would have smoked as much Durban
poison live resin as I just smoked,
[SPEAKER_00]: most people would be kind of in like a
panicky state or like a weird trippy
[SPEAKER_00]: state, but it makes me just right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me a little talkative,
but I'm drinking a Dr. Pepper and having
[SPEAKER_00]: some sativa dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to be talkative, but I just
love the Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Durban poison, it's a little lanky in
the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hoping to improve the structure,
improve the harvest and take that flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: into something that I can pass along and
maybe find a cushier Durban poison sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: a flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to see what I can do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to grow a bunch of those and
then we'll see where that goes from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the Platinum Tangy,
that's going to make just oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping that everything just tastes
like oranges and it's covered in tricones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spence and Maddie from the Garden of
Weedon bred the Platinum Tangy that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: got and they nailed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a perfect plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows very well, but it's small.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stays short and squat and it doesn't
yield enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by putting the bigger rise male to it,
I'm hoping to just increase the size of
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant is my main goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to bring the orange flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to increase the resin and I want to
make the plant bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my main goal there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super excited about those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the part where I make it
interactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got name suggestions for
Stardog to arise, I would like to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: name suggestions for that strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got name suggestions for
Durban poison to arise, I would like to
[SPEAKER_00]: hear your suggestions for that,
for those strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, I like Grateful Dead type
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Reggae theme type stuff,
but anything you've got, I may use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what you've got for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw some stuff at me.

[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to hearing your creative
name suggestions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Star Wars shit, stuff like that always
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Video game stuff is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff from my childhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I'm a GI Joe fan because I've
got a strain named Storm Shadow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of ideas, but I like
getting input from my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little breeding update,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move the podcast forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got an iTunes comment that I want
to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I read the iTunes comments,
I should let you guys know that they have
[SPEAKER_00]: changed the way that you can leave
comments and reviews or ratings and
[SPEAKER_00]: reviews on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of having to go all the way to the
iTunes store, if you're using an iPhone or
[SPEAKER_00]: an iDevice, go to the podcast that you'd
like to review.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably already subscribed to the

[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to leave myself a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, that's cheesy and hokey,
but there it is.

many stars, or for you to give me how many
[SPEAKER_00]: stars you feel I deserve, a title of your
review, and a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would appreciate it.

click on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be honest.

[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read the most recent review.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from a person who their
iTunes handle is lunchbox3, which I like
[SPEAKER_00]: really well, but they say I go by
chroniccoby.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were kind enough to give me a
five-star review and it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently started growing this year and
was recommended to this podcast by a
[SPEAKER_00]: friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks to your friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first podcast I ever listened to was
your show and what a great decision that
[SPEAKER_00]: was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, welcome to podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we opened the floodgates of
podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get into podcasts, you're going
to start listening to a lot of great shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So welcome to the world of podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your show incorporates just about every
aspect about cannabis, from state laws to
[SPEAKER_00]: tips on growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a fair amount of research to
familiarize myself with the basics and
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to hear you touch on them again
in such a thorough manner was extremely
helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, man, that means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that my podcast is paralleling
your research and that we are matching up
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm kind of reaffirming the things
that you read.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always nice to have some
affirmation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad I could do that for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see where I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I really enjoy how you keep the
mood, a good balance between serious and
[SPEAKER_00]: funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we got to be funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hang out with a bunch of smart ass
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was raised by a long line of
professional smart asses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do like to be kind of funny
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it just comes on accidentally
and naturally in the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like keeping it fun helps people
learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always had more fun in school when I was
laughing and my teacher was actually being
[SPEAKER_00]: cool and not being a dick and just forcing
useless information down my throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for enjoying the balance between
serious and funny and thanks for finding
[SPEAKER_00]: me funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure some people don't find my
shenanigans and my bullshit funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad that you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message or the review goes on to say
thanks for all the knowledge and time
[SPEAKER_00]: you've put into the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep on keeping on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, welcome to the world of
podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you were listening to a lot of
podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give a couple of friends a
shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are new to podcasting and you're
looking for more cannabis podcasts,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say listen to The Dude Grows Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great cannabis related podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want a podcast that is not
cannabis related, check out, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: The Joe Rogan Experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's something kind of random.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lately, I've fallen in love with the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't put out a new episode in
quite a while, but the old episodes are
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Under the Scales with Tom
Marshall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I am a big silly Phish fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am in love with the band Phish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen Phish a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Phish.
[SPEAKER_00]: The music of Phish, the sound of Trey's
guitar, the sound of Page's keyboards,
[SPEAKER_00]: the way Phishman plays the drums,
the way Mike dumps the bass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all just fucking magical the way it
all happens to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my favorite band.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy that writes a lot of their lyrics
is not in the band, but he is closely
[SPEAKER_00]: connected with the band.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has made a podcast about the band and I
am a few episodes in and I am addicted to
[SPEAKER_00]: this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there are 35 episodes total.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm 12 episodes in now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't listen to another podcast until I
finish every episode of this one,
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have to take a break just to not
hear Tom's voice for a minute,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm addicted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you guys are into Phish and you want
a podcast, you want to know a lot about
[SPEAKER_00]: Phish, there are two episodes back to back
where they interview Trey about his
[SPEAKER_00]: guitars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hearing Trey talk about his relationship
with Paul, the guy that built his guitars
[SPEAKER_00]: and how Paul became a guitar builder and
how it all just unfolded.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really made open my eyes to even more of
Phish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been following Phish since 1995 and I
learned a lot through this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a Phish kid, if you're a Phish
fan, I think you'll enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of rambles about a podcast,
but I recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
friend Chronic Coby, also known as
[SPEAKER_00]: Lunchbox3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the great review and the five
star rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also big thanks to everybody who's left a
rating and a review in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really helps me out on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage everyone else to go leave me a
rating and a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gets the show seen by more people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more people that see the show in the
iTunes feed, the more people can listen to
[SPEAKER_00]: the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more people listen to the show,
that means the more people will grow
[SPEAKER_00]: better cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: More people will help to legalize
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just spread the word, spread the love,
grow from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few episodes back, I talked about
Sweetleaf Dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweetleaf was the chain of dispensaries
that was rated and a few of the budtenders
[SPEAKER_00]: were arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually 13 people were arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 of them have actually been charged.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an update for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually found an article on the
cannabis that tells me everything I wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to read the article from
the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was written by Alicia Wallace on the
cannabis staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline says inside informants,
loopers, and the undercover investigation
[SPEAKER_00]: that led to Sweetleaf raids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sub headline is the Denver police
department search warrant reveals details
[SPEAKER_00]: of the year long investigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The article goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A budtenders six months stint at the
Sweetleaf marijuana center in Aurora came
[SPEAKER_00]: with no incident, no incidents,
no activity recognizable as illegal or
[SPEAKER_00]: suspicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same couldn't be said after that
employee was transferred to the Sweetleaf
[SPEAKER_00]: location off 38th Avenue and Clay Street
in Denver, according to a Denver police
[SPEAKER_00]: department affidavit obtained by the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are a little different here.
[SPEAKER_00]: An assistant manager allegedly told the
employee during his first work shift at
[SPEAKER_00]: 2647 West 38th Avenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get used to the loopers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the old location where this
employee allegedly worked, they didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: allow looping.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when they moved them to this location,
allegedly one of the employees told them
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll get used to the loopers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let me tell you what loopers are
really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a dispensary in Colorado, a
recreational dispensary, a customer is
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed to purchase seven grams of
cannabis per transaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that there has been a loophole found
where per transaction means you can walk
[SPEAKER_00]: out the door, drive your car around the
building, go back in the door and make
[SPEAKER_00]: another transaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can buy seven more grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there was a memo sent out by the
marijuana enforcement division saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey dispensaries, that's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they kept doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's looping.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is looping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was made clear that it can't be
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looping is when you just return or a lot
of people like to go to different
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries, which is that's cool because
that doesn't look like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not just going back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It go to a different dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes you not look so shitty,
but they're going to implement a tracking
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet because of stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me continue with the article and stop
assuming things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The article says the affidavit,
one of several filed as a request,
[SPEAKER_00]: research warrants in the case provides
some glimpses into the year long
[SPEAKER_00]: investigation of alleged illegal marijuana
sales at the Denver based sweet leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The investigation, which is ongoing,
zeroed in on alleged incidents of looping
[SPEAKER_00]: in which individuals would make repeated
purchases of one ounce of recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I said seven grams, not an ounce,
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The maximum allowed for purchase and
possession per Colorado law several times
[SPEAKER_00]: a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would go back several times and
buy several ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I did fuck up and say seven grams,
but when we originally started
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational cannabis in Colorado,
seven grams was the limit that out of
[SPEAKER_00]: state folks were allowed to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they quickly increased that once they
realized people were just shopping around
[SPEAKER_00]: and going place to place.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to slow that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now they sell them an ounce and an
ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were from out of state and you're
visiting here, an ounce is plenty of weed
[SPEAKER_00]: for you to have on you and just be
smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're smoking more than an ounce a
day, you got to have a lot of people with
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to be a heavy, heavy smoker or it
looks suspicious and you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're buying four, five, eight ounces
at a time, something's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me continue with the last paragraph
of this article here and we'll wrap up
[SPEAKER_00]: this update.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says on December 14th, police raided
several Denver area sweet leaf locations,
[SPEAKER_00]: executing search warrants and arresting 13
bud tenders, employees involved in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sale of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then here's the final part.
[SPEAKER_00]: As of Thursday, 10 employees have been
charged with either misdemeanor or felony
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 13 were arrested, only 10 have been
charged.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is another article attached to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says attorney for sweet leaf bud
tenders files to dismiss felony charges.
[SPEAKER_00]: The article is fairly long, but there is a
part in here that I wanted to share.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says that the sweet leaf employees,
and it lists a bunch of names,
[SPEAKER_00]: who were each charged with felony
distribution of marijuana, more than four
[SPEAKER_00]: ounces, acted within the bounds of state
law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their attorney Robert J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Corey wrote in a court motion filed
Thursday to dismiss the charges.
[SPEAKER_00]: The article also states that amendment 64,
the 2012 voter approved ballot measure
[SPEAKER_00]: legalizing adult use of marijuana sales
establishes threshold immunity from
[SPEAKER_00]: criminal protection, Robert Corey claimed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Colorado constitution allows for
adults to possess one ounce or fewer of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana in additions to actions such as
transferring of one ounce or under to
[SPEAKER_00]: another adult, as well as assisting
another adult, Corey wrote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those and other personal rights included
in legalization, amendment 64 specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: immunizes actions taken by marijuana
establishments, Corey added.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks like they've got a good
lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to get the charges
dismissed.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people think that this was just
kind of a wake up call by the MED saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, we see people doing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our way to let people know that
we're going to step in and do some shit
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will keep my eye on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will try to keep you guys updated on how
things unfold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I owe a huge shout out to our
friends over at the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to read more, there are
several links at the cannabis.co podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been going for like 20 minutes and my
throat's getting super dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: My eyes are getting bright and white and
lifting up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for me to press pause,
take a couple of dabs, put some caffeine
[SPEAKER_00]: in my head, put a little water on my
throat, and then I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to talk about,
uh, airy buds and a question that I got
[SPEAKER_00]: from my Instagram live feed about,
do airy buds contain more THC?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started talking about airy fluffy
buds and a lot of people on my Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: live feed right away were like,
yeah, fuck fluffy buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your opinion may change when I talk about
it after this dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys get your nail hot and get a fat
dab out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a dab with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took maybe too big of a dab of some
lucky charms, high cannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_00]: full spectrum extract from our friends at
apothecary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got super lit from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel a coughing fit coming on here in
just a couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I apologize when that does begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I took a break and got way too
high, I teased that I was going to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about airy buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on Instagram live a few days ago and
somebody asked me if airy buds contain
[SPEAKER_00]: more THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote a little piece about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was on Instagram live again
today and somebody said, what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast going to be about?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, it's going to be airy buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a couple of my friends instantly said,
fuck airy buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's allowed to their own opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I asked politely, why fuck airy buds?
[SPEAKER_00]: The answers I got were they're terrible to
trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Airy buds do suck the trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the other answer was zero bag appeal,
which is kind of true other than it makes
[SPEAKER_00]: your bud, your bag look huge, but
everybody wants those little rock bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wants those cushy tight
compacted buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wants not airy buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want dense buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they want a nice fat looking bag of
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want some green and some purple,
maybe some orange in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's, that's what people are looking
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not fluffy, crappy, shitty trimmed looking
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody, the first question that
started this was, uh, do airy buds have
[SPEAKER_00]: more THC?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, maybe that depends on the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That depends on your strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That depends on the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think more THC because it's airy
is a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is possible, however, is there is
more surface area of an airy bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that may allow for more room for more
trichomes because that is where the oils,
[SPEAKER_00]: the THC are contained.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are more, put your hand in a
fist, hold your hand in a fist in front of
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now imagine if I were to coat your fist in
trichomes, you've got a fist covered in
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, you can visualize that your hand
is covered in trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now open your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now look at all the space that would have
been missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: By those trichomes, if we had just coated
your hand in trichomes while you had a
[SPEAKER_00]: fist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you've got an airy bud that is open
like your hand, you've got that much more
[SPEAKER_00]: surface area to put trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way you could think about it,
make a fist, uh, spray your hand with a
[SPEAKER_00]: spray bottle so your hand's all wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stick your hand in some flour or some
powdered sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull your hand out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you see where all the trichomes would
have gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you see where all the trichomes did
not go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray your hand down with more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stick that bitch back in the flour or the
powdered sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how many more trichomes you just
gathered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the airy buds do not have more THC per
se.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have more surface area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess if you lab tested a gram of
those, if you tested a gram of high five
[SPEAKER_00]: buds against a gram of fist punch buds,
I guess maybe the high five open handed
[SPEAKER_00]: buds would probably contain more THC per
gram because there is more surface area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that may be a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we need to find out, are the buds
getting fluffy and foxtailed because of
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics or because of heat?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that may help us decide if we've got
good genetics that we want to use that
[SPEAKER_00]: foxtail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're going to say, why would I even
want it if it foxtails?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if it makes a lot of big foxtails
and it produces huge amounts of resin and
[SPEAKER_00]: huge amounts of THC, grow it and make
concentrates out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The market in Colorado Springs is about
70% concentrates, 30% flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Pueblo, it's about 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Denver, I do not know, but I would
assume it's right up there with Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: Springs in the 70% concentrate,
30% flour range.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure Edibles take up some of that
business, but for what I'm watching and
[SPEAKER_00]: the conversation that I had, people sell a
lot more concentrates than they do
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see that becoming the trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are in a hurry nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have time to roll a joint,
smoke an entire joint, and then fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke another one to get as high as you
want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you could grab a dabber, heat the
nail, take a fat dab and be on your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, people are much more health
conscious.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to consume as much flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also dabbing is just, I like dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to smoke flowers, but the trend is
getting to where concentrates are more
[SPEAKER_00]: popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concentrates sell more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are growing specifically to make
concentrates, why wouldn't you want airy
[SPEAKER_00]: buds that have more surface area to
contain more THC?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see that to be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just going to turn it into
concentrates, you just have to take off
[SPEAKER_00]: those big leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got big fan leaves, go clip
those off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start taking those off.
[SPEAKER_00]: A week before harvest, just go in there
and start cleaning up the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever you're in there watering,
pick one plant, just strip that bitch
[SPEAKER_00]: naked, keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day until harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: However many plants you got, I know you
may have a lot of plants, I know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just start cleaning up before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can just pull off all those leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at harvest time, you got these
airy buds that are covered in trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So find out if it's fox tailing and
getting airy because of environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it too hot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it stressing out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it too dry in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have a problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a problem, you've got to
figure that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got a problem and you're
still getting mad THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's genetics that's making it fox
tail and you've got the room dialed in and
[SPEAKER_00]: it makes fox tails and it's making a lot
of THC, that may be a hash plant that is
[SPEAKER_00]: worth keeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do predict that that is the way that
you're going to see cannabis turning for a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of commercial grows in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see more fluffy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bag appeal right now is all about,
like I said earlier, it's about little
[SPEAKER_00]: acorns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone wants rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Acorns, tight little buds that are covered
in resin, very well trimmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to see orange on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to see bright green in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to see purple in there,
depending on what you're into.
[SPEAKER_00]: The purple and orange combination looks
really sharp to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that really has a lot of bag
appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's usually not the weed I want to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want the bright green stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's been all about the bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since you're not going for bag appeal if
you're making concentrates, you can grow
[SPEAKER_00]: airy fluffy buds if it's based on the
genetics and not based on a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if those fluffy airy buds are
producing enough resin to make it worth
[SPEAKER_00]: your time and energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a strain that's growing
fluffy, perhaps a haze or some sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: tropical sativa that takes a long time and
it's growing real fluffy buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're finished with it, make hash
out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make BHO out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make live resin out of it and see what
percentage of a return you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if it's higher than your standard
return that you get on your BHO or your
[SPEAKER_00]: live resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just see if you get more out of it and it
may be worth your time and energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because it's foxtail-y, just because
it's airy, does not necessarily mean that
[SPEAKER_00]: that is not able to be high quality
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not picky, you're going to
put that bud in your grinder anyway and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to spin that grinder and turn
it into this little mulchy shit and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to roll the joint out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's your grow and it's airy and
fluffy and it's got like 38% THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: who gives a shit that it was fluffy,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It might taste amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might have all the trichomes in the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's just airy, who cares?
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you're getting your weight that
you expect that you need to meet your
[SPEAKER_00]: needs, like if you're growing medically
and you smoke two ounces a week,
[SPEAKER_00]: as long as you're pulling two ounces a
week, maybe that's the product for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who cares that it's airy?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with it other than
it doesn't have bag appeal and it sucks to
[SPEAKER_00]: trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're making concentrates,
it's the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've rambled on enough about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to my friends on Instagram Live,
first off, for asking the question about
[SPEAKER_00]: more THC in airy buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer there is there's more surface
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So technically by weight, there could be,
there could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not always a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a general answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a general rule, but if it's
coated in trichomes because there's more
[SPEAKER_00]: surface area, that is very possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, big shout out to all of my friends
who had the conversation with me a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit on Instagram Live and made me think
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate all of you guys.

iRegeneticsColorado.com website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for that website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like total shit right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been spending my energy more in the
garden, more at work, more on the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: than actually working on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not the web guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm better at breaking the website than
improving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a guy that does that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't spent any time together working
on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: The website looks like shit, but it is
alive and active and that is where the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the RSS feed is created.
[SPEAKER_00]: RSS feed is then sent out to all of the
other services where you're able to listen

[SPEAKER_00]: I post a lot of content there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two episodes every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those episodes is about three hours
every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other, it varies between 30
and an hour and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just depends on who comes over and rambles
with me, but it takes a lot of bandwidth
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep that website alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the people that contribute to Patreon,
you were covering the cost of my website.

[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody else has got your back.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2017, we did cover the cost of the
website perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just barely covered the cost of the
website with Patreon contributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're covering it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to help out, I appreciate
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that's enough begging,
but I do appreciate the love and support.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
I'll be back Thursday with the Throwback
[SPEAKER_00]: Thursday episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys for listening to
me ramble by myself for 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly appreciate all the love and
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been getting a lot of messages on
Instagram, a lot of emails, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Messages have been getting more and more
interaction from a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_00]: people trusting me with their gardens,
trusting me with advice and guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all the interaction,
all the support, all the words of
[SPEAKER_00]: encouragement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think that's all I've got for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back Monday with the brand new
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to my
friend, Michael P. And until next time,
[SPEAKER_00]: take a fat dab and give your mama hug for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's smoking sense of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: John Brown lock out of the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: They took it right before the lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: They took it right before the breakfast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone on that sense of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: People say that a sensei party.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone jump around like them hearty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here comes the naughty dready.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say his name is Freddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Him saying he's known sensei long time
