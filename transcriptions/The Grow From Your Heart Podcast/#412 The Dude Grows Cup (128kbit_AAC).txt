[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 412 of the Grow From
Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by our
friends at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds in your garden,
I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can find them at www
.OregonEliteSeeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has become a tradition that we start
the podcast off by talking about what I am
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I have got a nice buffet of
extracts from our friends at Apothecary
[SPEAKER_00]: Farms in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my go-to favorite has become this
Tropicana cookie fanbrosia jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started off as a 4-gram jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is quickly depleting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label says this is 72.4% THC with a
total of 83.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that says 85% total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a tasty concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love the Tropicana cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I remember correctly, the Tropicana
cookies won the Dude Grows Cup last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will talk about that in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, I owe a few people
some shout-outs from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a big shout-out to my friend
Squirrel Tactics, a huge shout-out to
[SPEAKER_00]: Bafsta, another giant grow from your heart
shout-out to my friend Aldridge,
[SPEAKER_00]: how about a big giant shout-out to Eric
Ross, and of course, another shout-out to

[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be

[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everybody caught the bonus episode
that I put out on Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put out an episode all about the Blue
Raspberry Truffle Strain, which I debuted
[SPEAKER_00]: at the Dude Grow Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope everybody got to listen to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite a few people mentioned they did
listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a great response to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People seem to like the way I describe
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for the support, thanks for
listening to the show, and thanks for the
[SPEAKER_00]: huge reaction at the Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people were really interested in
the Blue Raspberry Truffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, my Instagram is
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last few episodes, I've been crying
and complaining like a little girl that my
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent a bunch of emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I filled out a bunch of customer request
forms, and I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm back on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got my account going.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't remove anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cleaned out my inbox, so all my
messages are gone, but all my posts are
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my hashtags are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am back in action on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not already following me on
Instagram, I highly encourage you to give
[SPEAKER_00]: me a follow on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use Iri underscore genetics as my
company name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I post a lot of great cannabis
photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do live feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go talk about cannabis growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you come into my live feed and ask a
cannabis question, I will answer your
[SPEAKER_00]: question there in the live feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do encourage you to join me there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more thing I want to talk about before
we get to the Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why my voice is all burned out,
by the way, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked a bunch of flour and a bunch of
concentrates at the Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: My voice sounds like poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get there, I want to give a
huge shout out to my friend, Kelvin
[SPEAKER_00]: Medina.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelvin is from Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was attending the Dude Grows Cup in
Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: On his way from Oklahoma, he stopped at
the spot right here at the dab table,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he took a couple of fat dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promised Kelvin I was going to get him
uncomfortably high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure mission accomplished.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, Kelvin, thank you for stopping
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is great meeting people that I have
made friends with through the podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: through social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a good time making new friends
and meeting the people that I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: helping in their gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, thanks for coming through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Kelvin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the Dude Grows Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you what the Dude Grows Show
and the Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually what we're going to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dude Grows Show is a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another growing podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you've heard me mention that on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dude Grows Show is hosted by my
friend, the Dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's co-hosted by a dude named Scotty
Real.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is engineered by a guy known as the
Grow Guru.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got quite a few guys behind the
scenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have developed a great community.
[SPEAKER_00]: The community is known as the Dude Grows
Crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend, the Dude and Scotty put
together a great event.
[SPEAKER_00]: That event was last night at Cultivated
Synergy in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this was the fifth event.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I am correct, I am often wrong on
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was at least the third Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyhow, they threw the Dude Grows Cup at
Cultivated Synergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's designed to be a community event.
[SPEAKER_00]: The highlight of the event is sort of a
grow off.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are invited to enter their grow
into the competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is a blind taste test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody who attends the event is
considered a judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are given tokens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are offered a one hitter pipe as you
walk in and you are allowed to sample all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the entries.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a little bud bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the entries are numbered.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to sample those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you find an entry that you
deserve your vote, you put your little
[SPEAKER_00]: token.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put the tokens in the corresponding
jar and you say, that is the one I vote
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were over 35 entries.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were approximately 40.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember exactly how many at the
day of recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have that info available.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dude and Scotty haven't posted that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure they will post all of those
details very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, a lot of people got to smoke
approximately 50 entries of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not get to sample anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at my booth all evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to smoke the concentrates I brought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plenty of friends brought me plenty of
great samples to enjoy and smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all my friends that
brought me stuff to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me stay on track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dude Grows Cup was a cool kind of
smoke off, grow off sort of event thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The event is aimed more to be a community
get together sort of a vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of people, a lot of
members in the Dude Grows crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to meet up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all talk online.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all in the Facebook groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all in the social media groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all on Instagram talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good time to get together once a
year and actually put some faces to all of
[SPEAKER_00]: those funny Instagram names and see who's
posting those memes and see who's growing
[SPEAKER_00]: the dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a good time to get together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like a family reunion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what the Dude Grows show is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a celebration of the podcast that is
basically highlighted by a little grow
[SPEAKER_00]: competition, a friendly little grow
competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The day was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drive up there was a little hectic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to travel I-25.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody that knows about I-25 knows how
unpredictable that can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great drive until approximately
Monument and then suddenly snowstorm from
[SPEAKER_00]: hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was white.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just white.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't see the car in front of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The windshield was caked in shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sucked for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we got to Castle Rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: After Castle Rock, it was sunshiny again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like we were on two different
planets for that drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of strange, but we made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got up to the Dude Grows show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an easy time to load in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody there was super kind,
super friendly, super polite.
[SPEAKER_00]: They helped us load in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got set up super quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I met a few friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met a lot of friends there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few of my friends were kind enough to
enter some irie genetics strains into the
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude Grows cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to see and sample a few of those
entries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend Bruce brought me his entry.
[SPEAKER_00]: He let me see the scarlet begonias that he
entered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelvin came up and he let me see the
Donatello that he entered.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really great to see the work that
people are doing with the seeds that I am
[SPEAKER_00]: providing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great job to everybody who grew my
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelvin, you did a great job, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelvin brought some strawberry starburst
to my house and shared it with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't quite dried and cured enough to
be an entry for that cup, but it was
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smelled like tangy plus oranges plus
strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelvin actually had some of that flower
pressed into a rosin press by our friend
[SPEAKER_00]: Pedro's Grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know about Pedro, if you don't know
about Pedro, make sure you follow Pedro's
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow room on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give him a follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: He pressed some amazing rosin out of that
strawberry starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me say this here on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I talk a lot of shit about
rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a fan of rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time it tastes like burnt
popcorn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot stand the flavor of a popsicle
stick or when the doctor uses a wooden
[SPEAKER_00]: tongue depressor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It drives my body crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something about the feeling of that wood
on my tongue, it's making me shake and act
[SPEAKER_00]: weird right now just thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives me the chills.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something about rosin has that flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes like a popsicle stick or burnt
popcorn to me most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're just taking raw flour and
pressing it, it usually doesn't taste
[SPEAKER_00]: desirable, in my opinion, to my taste
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a hater on you and your rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm getting to is this strawberry
starburst rosin that Kelvin grew and Pedro
[SPEAKER_00]: pressed was delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go back for another dab of that
one right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I owe a big shout out to, first of all,
to Kelvin for growing that strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: starburst like a champion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit was, it was perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grew that sample that he gave me to
perfection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also, I want to extend a huge shout
out to Pedro for the marvelous job at
[SPEAKER_00]: squishing that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, like I said,
I'm not impressed with the squish and that
[SPEAKER_00]: was delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even Jaren from Five Eight was loving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Kelvin, I apologize that Jaren and
myself pretty much smoked all of your
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry starburst concentrate while you
watched, but that shit was delicious,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dude, you got a lot of great dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you had as much fun as we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk more about this dude grows
cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to see so many of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to meet so many people that I've
never seen before, that I've talked to
[SPEAKER_00]: online a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people were extremely,
extremely generous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was given many wonderful gifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of delicious flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of amazing concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite gifts, and I hate to
highlight anything because it makes
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody else feel lesser, but somebody
gave me a street sign and it is IRE
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics Boulevard or IRE Genetics Avenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the sign here, but it looks
just like the street signs on the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the stop sign, then right above
it, it says the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got one of those official street
signs that says IRE Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you are on my block.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you come onto my street, you are
officially on IRE Genetics Boulevard or
[SPEAKER_00]: IRE Genetics Street.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was a super cool gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really excited to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thank you if you're listening to the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my favorite gift of the weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoyed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to meet a lot of great people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep mentioning that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to meet Stabby Staberson in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, if anybody knows anything about
Stabby, Stabby and I have been friends
[SPEAKER_00]: online for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go on the Embracing Organic Show and
hang out with those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stabby doesn't show his face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stabby is one of those guys who would
rather remain anonymous.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't live in the most friendly,
cannabis friendly environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he needs to keep his face off of the
internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can't be out there like I am and show
his face and be a blabbermouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he stays in the shadows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an honor to finally meet my friend,
Stabby McStaberson.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're listening to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great to meet you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was also great to hang out with the
rest of the Embracing Organics crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a great time with those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of hung out at my booth for a
few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really good time to see
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a really hilarious picture with
Dirtman Dan.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're following Dirtman Dan on
Instagram, go check out the photo that I
[SPEAKER_00]: took with Dan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody calls Dan a hobbit or a troll
because he's about five foot two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am six foot five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I don't talk about that on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: People often make comments when they see
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing they say is, holy shit,
you're tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing they say is, your dreads
are crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I'm tall and I've got dreadlocks to
my knees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dirtman Dan is a gnome.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's basically a garden gnome when he
stands next to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you put the six foot five Rasta
Jeff next to the four foot two garden
[SPEAKER_00]: gnome, it was really a hilarious picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a good time taking a photo
with Dirtman Dan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a wonderful time seeing Jinx Proof
and Dung Beetle.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: I see you at every event.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great to hang out, get a chat with
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Miss Rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish she would have been at the event
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always is a pleasure to see that crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hung out with a lot of great people and
I could run through a really long list of
[SPEAKER_00]: name dropping and shout outs of all these
fun, great people that I got to hang out
[SPEAKER_00]: with and spend some time with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't want to miss anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels worse when you leave somebody
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to miss anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a big shout out to everybody who
showed support and showed love at the Dude
[SPEAKER_00]: Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you were too shy or too intimidated
to come say what's up, because everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: always emails me the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, hey, I saw you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was too intimidated to come say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: You looked busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, that's what I'm there for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to come say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come shake my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were too shy this time,
I'm just a normal person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got stoned as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a good time just like you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come say what's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come shake my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to give a huge shout out to
everybody who showed me love, who showed
[SPEAKER_00]: me appreciation, who has shown the Grow
From Your Heart podcast some love,
[SPEAKER_00]: who has shown just me personally some
love, and of course, everybody who
[SPEAKER_00]: supports my other company, iReGenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate all of the support
from the entire cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have really embraced me lately
and it has really made my life amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I want to extend an extra special
shout out to everybody who was in my
[SPEAKER_00]: corner, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: The iReGenetics booth was kind of tucked
over into the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ended up being kind of where the cool
kids hung out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, we were all just hanging out,
taking dads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse Gross was over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stabby McStaberson was hanging out over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sean was over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beautiful Miss Amy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amy was over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a good time just having kind of the
iReGenetics Grow From Your Heart sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: sub-click over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just having our own little, it wasn't a
private party, but we had our own little
[SPEAKER_00]: crew over there and everybody was welcome
to come hang out and a lot of people did,
[SPEAKER_00]: trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people came and went.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was cool having everybody just
hanging out in the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse and Sean hung out in the corner for
quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stabby McStaberson hung out for quite a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelvin and Kike held it down for quite a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had some nice little space over by my
booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really cool just to have the iRe
Army and the Grow From Your Heart crew
[SPEAKER_00]: just showing love and showing support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nobody would let me get anywhere near
white-eyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If my eyes started to get white,
if I looked like I didn't have cotton
[SPEAKER_00]: mouth properly, somebody passed me a
joint, somebody lit me up a dab,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a bunch of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can't tell by my voice,
I smoked a ton of product yesterday and I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to give a shout out to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: The product is improving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your guys' flowers are getting better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concentrates are getting better.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I used to go to events, people would
pull out their concentrates and they'd be
[SPEAKER_00]: like, hey dude, look what I brought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like to take a dab of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would be backpedaling trying to
figure out how am I going to tell this guy
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to dab his concentrate
because that looks like fucking motor oil
[SPEAKER_00]: or some kind of poop soup is what we used
to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really don't want to either put that
in my banger because that's going to ruin
[SPEAKER_00]: my nail and make my nail taste like shit
for the rest of the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I don't want to dab that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to burn my throat and it's
going to make my lungs taste like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the high from that is just going
to give me a headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back in the day, I would be trying to
figure out how to politely tell my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends, hey, I don't really want to smoke
your concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found out that the best way to do it
is to just kind of be like, oh man,
[SPEAKER_00]: that looks delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you tried this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I pull out my concentrates and I
give them a dab of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I take a dab and then they kind
of forget that they offered me a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's usually my way to shake
that off.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I did not have to do that at this
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every dab that was offered to me was
acceptable and I smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, every flower that was offered to me,
I smoked it and I enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not smoke any blunts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had something rolled in a blunt
wrap or a blunt, I did decline on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My voice and my throat took enough of a
beating at that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not really need to add the tobacco
blunt wrap to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do not enjoy a blunt wrap at all,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we put a lot of time and a lot
of work and a lot of energy into growing
[SPEAKER_00]: the finest cannabis we can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: We select for flavor, for aroma,
for production, trichomes, and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically what tastes to me,
kind of like a toilet paper tube,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just wrapping it up in a cardboard
tube with that blunt wrap and I do not
[SPEAKER_00]: approve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not hating on you if that's what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it if that's your thing, but I'm just
not going to hit it when you try to pass
[SPEAKER_00]: it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was quite impressed with most of the
product that I saw at the Dude Grows Cup
[SPEAKER_00]: this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw some product from out of state.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was quite impressive also.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people in illegal states that
are really killing it with their grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like here in Colorado,
we're kind of cheating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can drive to the grow store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell the guy, hey, I want this and
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he puts it on the counter and I pay
cash for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put it in my car and I drove home or
I drive home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I use that on my cannabis plants
that I can talk about having.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are six plants legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's got fucking six plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people in every single state
that showed up at the Dude Grows Cup with
[SPEAKER_00]: quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they make us look like we're cheating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can go to the grow store and get
all the shit real easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, that guy in Ohio, he's got to drive
to his friend's house and park his car in
[SPEAKER_00]: the garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they pull the friend's car out of the
garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They drive to the grow store in that car.
[SPEAKER_00]: They discreetly do their shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't talk to anybody in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody approaches you in the grow
store, you leave in those sort of states.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to get noticed,
recognized.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get what you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put it on the counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pay cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You drive that car around the block a
bunch of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you drive around other blocks a bunch
of times just to throw off your trail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you need to be extra paranoid in a
non-friendly state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then they drive around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go back to the friend's house,
park the car in the garage, transfer the
[SPEAKER_00]: newly purchased grow equipment from
friend's car to your car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you drive your car around the block a
few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drive the really long way home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drive around your block a couple of times
to make sure there are no strange cars in
[SPEAKER_00]: the driveway or no strange cars on the
block.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull into the garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unload your shit really discreetly in the
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Build your grow room when nobody can hear
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really different thing when you're
in a non-friendly state.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, in your friendly states,
in Colorado, in California, Washington,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon, anywhere you've got grow-friendly
laws, we are basically cheating when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to entering a grow competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a step ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're handicapping everybody else because
we can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to hide it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having to do it under stealth mode is a
whole extra challenge that we don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take it for granted if you are in a
legal state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've mentioned a bunch of
names and done a bunch of name dropping
[SPEAKER_00]: and given a bunch of thanks and a bunch of
shout-outs, but I haven't gotten to the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that deserve the largest shout-outs
of the evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, that would be my friend,
The Dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dude, thanks for a great party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, that includes Scotty Real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for a great party, Dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the invite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for having me on The Dude
Grows podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being on The Dude Grows podcast really
exposed me to a larger audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten a lot of reactions via my
email channel, via my social media,
[SPEAKER_00]: and through my emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people really noticed me there,
so I owe those guys a big thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for a great party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, big shout-out to Guru.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I saw you busting ass all night.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were staying busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't get to party.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were working, so I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody else was having fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guru was running in circles, making sure
everything was working smoothly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So was Scotty and The Dude, but toward the
end of the night, they got to chill out
[SPEAKER_00]: and have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fun watching everybody just run
around in circles and get it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm proud of those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks for the invite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks for the great party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks for the dedication and for the
what you're doing for the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys do a lot for the cannabis
community, a lot for growers, a lot for
[SPEAKER_00]: smokers, and a lot for the movement,
and I truly appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout-out to those folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a big shout-out to JR Token.
[SPEAKER_00]: JR Token kind of works behind the scenes
with the DGC crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have communicated a lot, and I
appreciate that, Dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I owe him a big shout-out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I can't wait for The Dude Grows
Cup next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is almost time, almost time,
to start looking for a larger venue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The place was just perfectly full.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it sells out at $350.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there were 349 people there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't count.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying it was perfectly full.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was beautifully set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoyed the event this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year, it gets a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, in my opinion, it was damn near
perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: There aren't many things I would change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a really great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I look forward to seeing you next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did not make it to The Dude Grows
Cup this year, do what you can to make it
[SPEAKER_00]: next year because it is a party.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a great community event.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were lots of great growers,
smokers, and community members.
[SPEAKER_00]: At one point, hanging out at my booth,
it was myself, Aquaponics Steve,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jinx Proof, and Scotty Real.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was kind of a podcasting VIP sort of
cannabis community, sort of hang out right
[SPEAKER_00]: there at my booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come meet all the cool cannabis people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and Jaren was hanging out quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a funny story.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the awards ceremony, Jaren from
5.8, New Millennium Nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: decided to stop by my booth and hang out,
and he was taking a dab of Kelvin's
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry Starburst Rosin that was
pressed by Pedro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hard for me to say Strawberry
Starburst Rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brain didn't want to go down that path.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was actually taking a dab of it when it
was announced that he won an award for his
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he took third place for his entry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was funny that he was taking a dab,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, hey, you got something to do,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to set that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just really funny, really casual.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're into the cannabis industry,
if you were into the people who are on
[SPEAKER_00]: podcasts, if you're into all of that
stuff, I think you would have a great time
[SPEAKER_00]: at The Dude Grows show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we got to hang out this year,
and if I didn't give you a shout out,
[SPEAKER_00]: if your name didn't get mentioned,
don't take it personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to leave anybody out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I mentioned a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are hundreds more people I could
mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to everybody who hung out
over in the iReGenetics corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to everybody who gave me
some support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that covers everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to everybody that hears
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got big love for the whole cannabis
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big thanks to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number one question that I was asked,
well, the number two and three question,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess number one is, how tall are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And number two is, how long are your
dreads?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is really weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cannabis event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, let's ask about weed stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number three question that I got asked
at this event was, do you have any
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, my answer was repeatedly,
no, I do not have any fem seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: regular seeds only at this event.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in approximately 70-ish days,
those are breeder terms, approximately 70
[SPEAKER_00]: days, I should have feminized seeds
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be available through Oregon
Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking for iReGenetics
Feminized Seeds, they will be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will have Lemon Jeffrey available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will have the Golden Goat Feminized
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be dropping the first batch of the
Orange Gazum to hit the public through
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are approximately two weeks into
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they need quite a bit more time to get
going, but check back in about 60,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe 70 days, and we will have some
feminized seeds available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also was approached by another
distributor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a very soon to come episode,
I am excited to announce that I should
[SPEAKER_00]: have been picked up by another very large
distributor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of you have already caught on to who
I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a seed buyer and a seed shopper,
I am excited to make that announcement
[SPEAKER_00]: here on a very soon to come episode of the

420 mean to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: 420 is quickly approaching.

[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I asked it, somebody sent
me a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, do you mean 420 the time,
420 the day, or 420 the number?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know what it means to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it mean the time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it mean the number?
