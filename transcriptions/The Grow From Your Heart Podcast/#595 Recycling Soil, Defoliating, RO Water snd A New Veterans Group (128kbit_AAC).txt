[SPEAKER_00]: Are you ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff,
and this is episode 595 of the Grow From
[SPEAKER_00]: Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to read a
message from a veteran, and then we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to focus on a message from our
friend Tonto that asks about recycling
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let's do a few shout
outs to a few members of the 710 Club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the 710 Club are the folks who
support us on Patreon at the $7.10 Inlet
[SPEAKER_00]: level or higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with no further ado, let's start off
with the big Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friend, Caribou Heart
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks and big shout out to everybody
who continues to support the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not supporting the show on
Patreon and you would like to learn how to
[SPEAKER_00]: do so, all you have to do is visit www
.patreon.com forward slash Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_00]: Heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I do include that link in
the show notes and in the video
[SPEAKER_00]: description to make it super easy for all
of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I am coming to you on a cold
Colorado evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was out doing some holiday shopping
today and there was a very intense vibe
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of weird energy out there
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: The past couple of weeks have been very
intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to remind you to not let that
shit get to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you're out there doing your
holiday shopping, if you're doing whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to do and life is getting to you,
shake it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, it's the holiday season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody is stressed to the limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a weird year for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let that little tiny bit of shit tip
you at the end of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get a fresh new year here
pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, we're going to get some sort of
a fucking break.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2020 is almost over.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2021 is going to be a fresh start.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only a few more days left of this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then maybe we can get rid of this fucking
curse or whatever happened to us in 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: My point is, don't let all that bullshit
get to you, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your head up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give gifts from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be compassionate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay a good person in these times of
stress and these weird times.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when we find out who the good
people are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be a dickhead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let this stress get to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand it can be overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a fucking lot right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are rude.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of weird obstacles we've
got to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of our Christmas gifts are going to be
laid because the mail is basically fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: stuck right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't let that get to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to affect you emotionally,
spiritually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shake it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke a bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give somebody a hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang out with me on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that shit out of your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we going from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is time to give my friend EZ057
a big thank you shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been getting a lot of messages from
people who have been following the show
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's not up for the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like when I upgraded the show,
I wanted something a little bit classier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't sure what was going to go up on
the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our friend EZ057 took initiative and
sent me a wonderful gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you can see behind me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the iReGenetics logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says iReGenetics Premium Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got my red, yellow, and green colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the logo that comes on my seed
packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was blown away when I opened it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was better than I could even imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I hung it up and it fit
perfectly behind me, the lights hit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole room just went ah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to our buddy EZ057 for
the beautiful iReGenetics Premium Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: decoration that is hung up right behind
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to tip my head out of the way
just for a moment so you can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are listening to the podcast on an
audio format, this is one of the times I
[SPEAKER_00]: highly encourage you to check out the
YouTube video because I'm going to move my
[SPEAKER_00]: stoned ass out of the way and let you look
at this cool artwork for just a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to EZ057.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look how smooth that is, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the iReGenetics up top.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Premium Seeds down here on the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the cross in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got my colors on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pattern in the background stands out
real bold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it looks great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to the artist who created the
logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then big thanks to EZ057 for printing
it and having it sent to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on canvas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really professional.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really high quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was blown the fuck away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first Christmas gift I've
received this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we going to go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: New camera settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you noticed, but I noticed
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am recording with a brand new camera
setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still learning the Sony a64 cam.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you love or hate this camera setting,
let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it's going to look like
until I start doing color correcting.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I see on my little screen there is
always different compared to what I see on
[SPEAKER_00]: my big screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be some color correcting,
some editing to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom line is I'm using a new
setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you hate it, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you love it, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may take your feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may just keep doing my own thing,
but I'd like to know what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to know if you liked it before or
now or just give me some feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still learning this equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your input means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the one watching, so let me know
what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we going from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: The next important thing to talk about is
Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're following me on Cannabuzz,
you know that Cannabuzz has recently
[SPEAKER_00]: changed the way they do their direct
messaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until yesterday, you were able to direct
message anybody else on the Cannabuzz app.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabuzz is a free application available
for your Android or Apple device.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cannabis friendly social media
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't buy, sell or trade cannabis
there, but you can post your cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: related content.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can post your dab videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can post your garden pictures,
post all kinds of cannabis related
[SPEAKER_00]: content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unlike many of the other popular
social media platforms, you will not be
[SPEAKER_00]: scrutinized.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you do go post in a bunch of
booty pics and a bunch of porn and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will politely ask you to stop doing
that because that is not what the app is
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have taken advantage of the
app.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have found some loopholes and they
begin direct messaging people and asking
[SPEAKER_00]: for money and sending porn and a bunch of
spam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Cannabuzz was forced to minimize the
direct messaging interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they have done is now you can only
message somebody if you are mutually
[SPEAKER_00]: following each other, which means I have
to follow you and you have to follow me if
[SPEAKER_00]: we want to direct message each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense to anybody's account,
I don't want to follow all 30,000 of the
[SPEAKER_00]: people on Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes my feed a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are selective about who we follow
because we want to see certain pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what social media is for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that I don't want to see your
pics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just I'm more focused on certain
people's content.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's curated content for what I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to be required to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there are about 30 to 40,000 users
on Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to follow 40,000 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was following about 60 because I enjoy
those accounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a new app.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still building accounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: My point is I cannot direct message with
you unless we are mutually following each
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is drastically and greatly limited
the amount of interactions I can have on
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not ignoring you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not blocking you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not dodging you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a feature that had to be turned on
on Cannabuzz to protect the Cannabuzz
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will admit I was upset.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was frustrated at first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like I was being cock blocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like a lot of my interactions were
going to be limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like I kind of abandoned my
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an open door policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you send me a message on Cannabuzz,
it may take me a couple of days,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I will reply to that message up until
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I won't even get your message.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like I blocked off a large
member of my community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on Cannabuzz from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people really appreciated the
interactions we were having.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now those interactions are not
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: At first I was upset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I understand it was necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our community was at risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were getting spammed.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were getting scammed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was content happening that we did
not support or promote or condone on
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: So corrections needed to be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is only temporary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The development team is working on new
things to get us around this problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But until then, we're going to have to
minimize the way we message each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may not affect a lot of users.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a larger account than many folks on
there, so my account was affected more by
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it will affect everybody who was
relying on me for a grow question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were having a conversation or
something, we can't communicate now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that has limited us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a way around this until this is
fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got an urgent grow question that
you were going to ask me on Cannabuzz,
[SPEAKER_00]: all you have to do is send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address, of course, is
growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will get to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I am getting a ton of emails from
the Help tab on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not ignoring you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Christmas season.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the holiday season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm simply overwhelmed by all of those
messages and Christmas shopping and life
[SPEAKER_00]: and family stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not ignoring anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love all of you like my own children,
like my own pets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will answer all of those messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be patient with me, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are thousands of you and there's one
of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing my best to get to all of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all mean the world to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without each and every one of you,
this wouldn't be the success it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't be successful and my show
wouldn't be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brand wouldn't be crushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do appreciate, love and respect all
of you, but you've got to be patient with
[SPEAKER_00]: me, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will get to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can't message me on Cannabuzz,
please do not abandon Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are saying I'm ditching the service
because of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a temporary problem that will have
a real solution and things will be much
[SPEAKER_00]: better once that solution comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that Cannabuzz is working on quite
a few updates that are coming in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: The development team takes some time to
get stuff going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It costs money to do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of this stuff and COVID is slowing
everything down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once they get the messaging fixed,
also another feature that is coming is the
[SPEAKER_00]: live chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do a live video on Cannabuzz and I
can go talk and I can hang out,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you guys cannot chat and interact with
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the future, that will be interactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be able to see the comments you're
leaving and I can reply to them just like
[SPEAKER_00]: that other app that I use on Mondays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please don't abandon Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's frustrating to be limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there are some weird things
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get frustrated and ditch us now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is when we need you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please stick around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just simply email me at
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will get back to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take me a moment because
I've got thousands of messages in my
[SPEAKER_00]: inbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will answer every single one of them
individually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a secretary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have an intern.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a social media person.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read genetics is me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grow from your heart podcast is me and
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got to work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all us together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be patient with me guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do love you and I'm going to get to your
messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like the message was super
urgent, message me again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it to the top of the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't just keep doing that though.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your garden is in fucking dire trouble,
message me again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get you going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I want to send a big thank you to
Jostafari.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the last episode, I said that I wanted
a little logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: This little logo that is right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where it is yet because it's
not in the video yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be there after editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the little logo that's right about
here that looks super slick on the screen
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, that came from our friend
Jostafari.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the very quick submission.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I pressed go on that episode and
as soon as it launched to iTunes and
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube, Jostafari was like, oh,
you wanted a logo?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you go, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do amazing work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of submissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to cycle through all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jostafari was right on top and I loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So his is going up today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will cycle through all of the
submissions I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put a bunch of different logos up on
the screen over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see which one sticks the best and we
will continue to use that one for the long
term.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to audition them slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to everybody who sent me cool
little GFYHTV logos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people sent multiple options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people did edits and corrections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time we're going to use Jostafari's
little logo right here on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we going to go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote mid topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't the main topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the pre main topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, somebody was saying that if
Cannibuzz was going to minimize messaging,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe we should do Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I opened up my message box and I
got this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes, Oh, I got the wrong one on top of
the paper here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me fix that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only human.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey, Jeff, I am a Patreon
contributor of the seven 10 club and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to episode five hundred and
eighty six.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a disabled veteran with PTSD from
deployments in the army.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your service, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I am the opposite of most of your
veteran emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not looking for someone to help me
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather, I am looking to help out other
veterans in your group.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in reference to I asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a while back we asked to get help for a
grow light for a veteran in need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our friends at Blacksail Market,
shout out to Keith from Blacksail Market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keith was able to donate a light to a
disabled veteran in need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that veteran got seeds and a light and
a lot of useful advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are now growing with a Canon LED
light thanks to a very generous
[SPEAKER_00]: contribution from our friend at Blacksail
Market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this veteran wants to kind of continue
that trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says growing this plant the past few
years has saved my life and helped me to
[SPEAKER_00]: stop drinking nonstop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be quite honest with you, before I got
my medical marijuana card, I was a sloppy
[SPEAKER_00]: drunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I got my medical marijuana card,
I told myself if I get this card and I can
[SPEAKER_00]: go to the weed store every day and buy as
much cannabis as I want, there's no reason
[SPEAKER_00]: to drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point, I quit drinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a similar sense, cannabis saved my
life because if I would have kept
[SPEAKER_00]: drinking, I would be dead or in jail or
would have hurt somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably would have gotten a DUI by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have gotten in a fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have done something stupid with as
much as I drank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm six foot five and nearly 200 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and whiskey were good friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit did not work out very well
toward the end of the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I do agree with you that quitting
alcohol and switching over to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: full time probably saved both of our
lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good to hear that, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you were alcohol free and I'm
glad you're on team cannabis with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I wonder if the DGC could help
get a discord group started for your
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good platform for a lot of us to
chat and get help from each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a successful home grower in
prohibition land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking forward to possibly linking up
with other veteran growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay lifted from our friend pro brewer
home growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might be making some beer,
which is still cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're making some beers and consuming
it responsibly, that's just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your thing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you're not drinking to fucking
block.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out and to cause problems and get away
from problems, then you're cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, I really enjoyed this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that a veteran is reaching out to
help other veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the grow from your heart
podcast and the iry army come into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our good friends was kind enough to
create us a iry genetics, grow from your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart, iry army discord page.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the correct terminology
is for discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am learning discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent a couple hours on there today.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going on on that app, but there are also a
lot of cool people on that app.
[SPEAKER_00]: The iry genetics grow from your heart
group is growing quite rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, big shout out to our friend gray
beard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gray beard took the initiative to create
the iry genetics, iry army, grow from your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart, discord page channel, whatever it
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was created by gray beard.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then sent me a message and said,
Hey, I did this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're cool with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, bro, I asked for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big salute to gray beard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does mean a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also shout out to lemur priest,
the captain and commander of the iry army.
[SPEAKER_00]: For being the main moderator in the
discord group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where I am headed with this is I am now
part of a discord group.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an iry genetics, iry army,
grow from your heart, discord group that
[SPEAKER_00]: does exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I read this message,
I sent a little message to lemur priest
[SPEAKER_00]: and it said, Hey bro, we need to get a
group in the discord group that helps get
[SPEAKER_00]: gear to veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now by the time you hear this message
on discord, this will be a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join us on discord, make an account,
find the iry genetics, iry army,
[SPEAKER_00]: grow from your heart group and jump in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still learning the app.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that as you scroll, you will see a
spot that says grow gear for vets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll take you to the feed where you can
talk to people who are in need or have
[SPEAKER_00]: gear to donate to veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also do intend to create a Facebook
group for the same purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have a name yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am in talks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making sure I'm going to do this
legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking to my accountant and a
paralegal, making sure that I don't get
[SPEAKER_00]: myself in any trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, just by starting the group,
if something goes wrong, it could land on
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to find my legal boundaries
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will start the Facebook group to
help get veterans gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be something about the grow from
your heart, a gear for vets, something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that will be in the Facebook group
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will make that, um, by the time this
episode comes out, that will be completed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a phone call tomorrow that will let
me know what I need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a big shout out to gray beard for
starting the discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to lemur priest for kind of
moderating that big shout out to everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: who already joined the discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was on there today, there was a
bunch of people and then big super shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out to our friend pro brewer home grower
for being a veteran and wanting to reach
[SPEAKER_00]: out and help other vets.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is really super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys join the discord group,
find the Facebook group that I will make.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to find the legal guidelines and
see how much trouble I can and cannot get
[SPEAKER_00]: in by doing this, but I will make the
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will happen and we will get some gear
into the hands of veterans in need.
[SPEAKER_00]: These people served our country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, like I've said before, I don't agree
with war.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think shooting people and bombing
people is cool, but if somebody's got to
[SPEAKER_00]: do it, uh, I have huge respect for the
people that put their lives on the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sign up to go do that because if you
start throwing grenades at me and shooting
[SPEAKER_00]: at me, I'm running that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: These gentlemen and ladies, they're
running that way into the fucking fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is fucking brave.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is honorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is commendable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've done a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get them some gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get them growing so they can treat
their anxiety, depression, PTSD,
[SPEAKER_00]: and not drink themselves into a stupor,
not dull themselves out with a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: pills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's help the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who keep us free, free freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now let's move into,
did I cover all of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm going to need volunteers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to need volunteers for this
Facebook group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've said before, I'm simply
overloaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm trying to interact with all of the
messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to be responsible for a lot of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am in constant go mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not complaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, uh, idle hands are the devil's
playground, especially me.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I get bored, I'm good at fucking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to stay busy, get myself out of
trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I will need volunteers to help me
run this Facebook group.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be kind of an autonomous
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I create it, introduce a few people,
I want to be able to step back and let the
[SPEAKER_00]: group do its thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, people give gear, people receive gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I may need volunteers to help moderate,
help run that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know if you're interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email at grow from your heart
at hotmail.com or join the group and let
[SPEAKER_00]: me know that you are interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may need help verifying veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be one thing that we need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll need help connecting veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll need people with gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got gear that you want to give
away or donate or if you're a company that
[SPEAKER_00]: is willing to donate equipment,
we could use lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, lights are usually the most
expensive things to get to growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can use nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use everything that you can donate
for a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that there is somebody out there
who needs that for their setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So help us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, please help us out on the
discord and on the grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_00]: gear for vets, Facebook group.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is what I've got for that
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also Jesse, uh, our friend Jesse's been on
the show before actually just set up
[SPEAKER_00]: another veteran with another light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've already got two lights in two
veterans gardens and we haven't even
[SPEAKER_00]: started the grow from your heart gear for
vets program yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you guys for all of that support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move forward to the next message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, big shout out to my veteran
friend pro brewer home grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate the support and thank you
for trying to help out your fellow vets
[SPEAKER_00]: and thank you once again for your service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let's move to a next message.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from another person who is
a veteran.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't do that on purpose, but I've seen
photos of this young man in his uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this one just comes from Tonto and it
goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey, my name is, and I'm not
going to read your real name, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Tonto from Alberta,
Alberta, Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to all of the hard work and audio
material you have put out there at zero
[SPEAKER_00]: cost to everyone, which has given me the
confidence and knowledge to switch from
[SPEAKER_00]: legal companies in Canada to a home
medical cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot in that first sentence
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to our friend, Tonto.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he gets a lot of shout outs on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great person, beautiful family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he said, thanks for all of the hard
work and audio material and video
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonto, please check out the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, check out YouTube, subscribe to the
YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That helps me out a lot, but at zero cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put this out absolutely free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do ask for Patreon contributions,
but if you're not able to contribute,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't block you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't shy you away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still encourage you to listen and better
your grow better yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that pay for the Patreon
contributions, they're covering you also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let me keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I recently received my grow
license from health Canada and I can
[SPEAKER_00]: legally grow 25 plants, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is nice here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get six recreational plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're a medical marijuana patient,
you get six more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're allowed 12 plants per household.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no tricks you can do to get more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to be able to play some tricks and
run some numbers and do some things and
[SPEAKER_00]: get some more.
[SPEAKER_00]: They shut us down on all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 25 is a good number, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says no words or amount of money can
show my gratitude for sharing so much
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge with the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, bro, this right here is what does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This interaction is what pays me back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You saying thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sending me pictures of the grow and of
the family and how happy you are with the
[SPEAKER_00]: success you're having.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff pays me back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't worry too much about trying to
pay me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and you do contribute to Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are paying me, but still you don't
owe me anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a beautiful relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it says your podcast is my number one
way to consume and absorb information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from the bottom of my bottom of my
heart, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prefer for providing a foundation of
knowledge for me to build on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did those statements that people send me
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is currency to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were, uh, you're knocking off all the
fucking holiday stress that I had,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the shopping bullshit I had to deal
with, all the fucking standing in line,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the rushing around, all the,
you wash that all away with these types of
[SPEAKER_00]: compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff is currency.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is payment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That recharges my soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I hope that you and yours are
doing well and safe in this time of
[SPEAKER_00]: uncertainty in our world history.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is so weird right now, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am well, my daughter's well,
my mom is well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody directly around us is
pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're well too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're doing all right,
but thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I know a lot of people I have
been and will continue to be hit very hard
[SPEAKER_00]: by COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, my town is, uh, infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, half the people around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just said that I'm well, my mom is well,
and my daughter is well, but we all know
[SPEAKER_00]: five or six or 10 people who all have
COVID and we all know somebody who has
[SPEAKER_00]: passed from COVID at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, uh, it is getting hit very hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I am very fortunate to be in my
current situation, which has left me
[SPEAKER_00]: better off than most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, isn't it great when people realize
that they are better off than most.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's such a good feeling to see you're
like, man, I'm doing pretty good for
[SPEAKER_00]: myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to acknowledge that you're doing
better off than most, that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: compassionate thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm rambling today, but we're going to
stay focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, but to show my support and
thanks, I have increased my Patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: subscription.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although small, it still helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am sure, uh, Tonto, you're a family man
and just the fact that you are able to
[SPEAKER_00]: contribute at all and you volunteered to
do so, that means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't ever feel like your contribution
is little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody out there feel like your
contribution is little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people give a dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people give a hundred dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I love the people that give me a
dollar as much as the people who give me
[SPEAKER_00]: $100.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those people that give me a dollar
may have $2 and they gave me one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those people that have a hundred
dollars may have a hundred and one and
[SPEAKER_00]: they gave me a hundred of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just $1 and a hundred dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it probably feels weird to the
people who gave me a hundred to say that
[SPEAKER_00]: you mean as much to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you gave me one, or if you gave me a
hundred, I appreciate love and respect you
[SPEAKER_00]: just the same, but I do see the different
contributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't try to judge you for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that just sounds weird because now the
people that gave me more feel like I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: respect them more, but, uh, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to talk myself out of
this circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's jump back into the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ha ha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it says, I do have a couple of
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I was hoping you could answer these
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have searched the internet for answers,
but the information wasn't available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, when you do find the information,
you're going to find one article that
[SPEAKER_00]: contradicts the article that you thought
was working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another article that will really
spin your mind and give you different
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the internet can be really challenging
to find new information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you reached out to me because I
can give you real advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I didn't trust the internet and
there was no real source for the
[SPEAKER_00]: information you have mentioned in your
episodes that you remove any large fan
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves with a purple stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious as to why, because that is the
first time I heard it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been curious since I heard it,
I've been doing a bit more defoliation
[SPEAKER_00]: every grow as I get more confident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is in a recent episode,
I've said to when you were defoliating to
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliate any leaf with a purple stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our friend Tonto is asking why I take
off the leaves with the purple stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main basic reason that I say remove
the leaves with the purple stems is that
[SPEAKER_00]: is a very trainable task.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I say, all right, guys, we're going to
our gals, guys and gals grow team.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to defoliate this whole room
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to go in and take off every
leaf with a purple pedial.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is really easy to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really easy guideline,
a really easy instruction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can visually see purple pedial,
break it off, not purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep moving purple, break it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes it real easy, real trainable
for anybody to understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why do I want those leaves gone is
the next part of this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually if the leaf has developed a purple
pedial or pedial, however you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: pronounce it, that is probably a big
enough leaf that it is blocking something
[SPEAKER_00]: beneath it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that bud site below should be getting
the light that this big leaf is blocking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you got a big leaf here,
you got a bud development here,
[SPEAKER_00]: this pedial is probably purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead and pull that leaf off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That light is now going to hit this bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bud's going to get those,
uh, the PPFD, that photon energy,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that bud will grow bigger and fatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is why I remove those big leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the purple pedials, those are older
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they are thicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably, uh, if you're going to
get a deficiency or a problem,
[SPEAKER_00]: those are the leaves that it's going to
show up on first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, those are where the spider mites,
the powdery mildew go first.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we get rid of those leaves that are,
those are less hotels for bugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: less opportunities for powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the oldest and biggest
leaves that are blocking the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are several reasons why I'm
taking those out of there mainly to stop
[SPEAKER_00]: blocking the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also it will help with humidity
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a giant grow, we get a lot of
respiration and transpiration in a giant
[SPEAKER_00]: grow without that many leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not releasing that much moisture
into the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're also mitigating bug problems at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason I say purple pedials is
because those are the bigger leaves and
[SPEAKER_00]: those are the older leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are most likely the leaves
blocking my developing bud sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I made that one clear for you
because there are more parts to this
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, could you explain or point to me
a podcast about reusing soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to be more eco-friendly and save
a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to reuse my soil if there are
not too many cons to doing so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recycling and reusing soil can be very
cost effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also be very dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had any problems in your grow,
if you saw one bug, I don't care if it was
[SPEAKER_00]: a thrip, a spider mite or a fungus net,
I would reconsider recycling the soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: not do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did not have any problems in your
grow through the entire grow, then you can
[SPEAKER_00]: consider recycling the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: In part of your message, you do tell me
that you were using HP Pro Mix with added
[SPEAKER_00]: perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first things that comes to mind
is if you do recycle that soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to be dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is basically just a little bag of dirt
to hold your roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no living stuff in there because
at the end of your last cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should have flushed heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: You removed all of the bottled nutrients,
all the built up salts, all the stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: was in that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have washed it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've basically got a bag of dirt at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing living in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using the Pro Mix, you've washed
all that stuff out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The very first thing I would recommend is
you need to reactivate that soil with some
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put probably some recharge in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Scotty Real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put some recharge in that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would honestly rinse out that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your three or five gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you tell me what size pots you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't look like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your pots of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dump those pots of soil into a big
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remove the big root balls if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get as much of the big stuff out of there
as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a claw type thing and just break it
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget what that claw looking thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use two of those with both hands and just
get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Break all that soil up the best you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull out all the big root balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you re-pop the pots,
I would water them before you even put
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix up a batch of water and put the
recommended amount of recharge in that
[SPEAKER_00]: water and water that through your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also maybe put some enzymes in that same
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we are doing now is we are
reactivating that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna get some microbial life into
that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put some enzymes in there,
those enzymes will help break down all the
[SPEAKER_00]: old dead decaying shit that is left behind
from your old plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will actually turn that stuff into
usable food for your new plants that go in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would cut down the plants,
pull out the root balls, break up the
[SPEAKER_00]: dirt, put it into a container,
stir it up real good, get it all mixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe consider adding a percentage of
fresh soil to this mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say that because that old soil is burnt,
it's dead, there's nothing in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe add some fresh soil, add some more
perlite just to give it a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then once you've got that all mixed in,
put it into your pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're using threes,
fives, or sevens, but put it into the
[SPEAKER_00]: pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then water those pots with recharge and
enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to reactivate your soil and
revitalize your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you are back to that original ProMix
because that ProMix is sold with Michael
[SPEAKER_00]: Rice or Mix inside of there, so you need
to add something to get you back to ground
[SPEAKER_00]: zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got it all cleaned up,
we've got it re-micro'd, we've got an
[SPEAKER_00]: enzyme to start cleaning stuff out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is going to work safely for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, that is probably the most
effective and efficient way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that you flushed heavily before
you harvested, make sure you get all those
[SPEAKER_00]: root balls out of there, put some micros
in there, put some enzymes in there before
[SPEAKER_00]: you plant your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water it once, maybe water it twice,
let it dry, then do your normal transplant
[SPEAKER_00]: method.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you had any bugs, any problems,
I would not do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is much, much easier in cocoa than it
is in soil or soilless mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cocoa, cocoa doesn't hold anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can run a bunch of water through the
cocoa and all the nutrients, all the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: will strip right out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can measure the EC or the pH or
the PPMs of the water that's coming out
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can tell there's nothing left in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not as easy in soil or dirt,
but I think you will be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're a smart guy, so I'm sure you
will know this is probably good soil to
[SPEAKER_00]: recycle or bad soil to recycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell if you had bugs, if you had
problems, that's when you're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it looks healthy, if it feels good in
your hands, go ahead and do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't feel good to your hands,
if it doesn't feel good in your heart,
[SPEAKER_00]: avoid it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you will know better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there are more parts to this
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, the next part of the message
says, during COVID-19, my access to RO
[SPEAKER_00]: water from the store could be restricted.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the situation arises that I cannot get
RO, would the calcium buildup do any harm
[SPEAKER_00]: in my veg tent or would it just build
white powder on everything?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I do not use RO water in my
personal grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't use RO water in most of my
commercial grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in Colorado, we've got pretty good,
pretty clean water.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the commercial grows, I use a big boy
filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not RO.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a personal grow, I use it straight from
the hose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not using RO water and I do not
experience any issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: RO water kind of makes things a little bit
more challenging because it's harder to
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no buffering in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you will be just fine if you are
not able to get to your RO water,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if you're using the HP Pro Mix
and the nutrients you listed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be no problems not using the RO
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to adjust the amount of
CalMag you were feeding the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that CalMag and the calcium is
actually in the RO water, but I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think it will make a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I don't know if you have an
answer for this, but I remember hearing on
[SPEAKER_00]: one episode not to mix liquid add-ons with
organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm currently using Guy Green's All
Purpose with Dry Amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would I be able to use liquid karma
without doing any harm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any cons to mixing the two?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you will be okay mixing liquid
karma in with that organic mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing to think about when you are
working with organics and bottled
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients is whatever is in that bottle is
chelated and buffered and really
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if the product you are using
is going to kill off your organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the buffers, you're from Canada,
so there are chelates in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the States, it's chelation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We say chelate, chelate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, the words are different up
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just confused my own brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worry about the salt nutrients destroying
your mycos.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a lot of organic stuff,
those bottled salt nutrients can wreak
[SPEAKER_00]: havoc on your organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all depends on what products you are
using together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things will work together,
some things will not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is always best though, in my opinion,
if you're going to run organics,
[SPEAKER_00]: stick with organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to use synthetics,
stick with the synthetics because you may
[SPEAKER_00]: just be killing off one thing by adding
the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a chemistry expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic chemistry is not my area of
expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not the organic grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do the bottles and salts, so I know that
there is no problem in my mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, liquid karma is a very gentle
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is seabird guano, that is kelp.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of other things that I
can't remember in there, but they are
[SPEAKER_00]: basically organic ingredients and I do not
foresee a problem by mixing the liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: karma in with your Gaia products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaia products, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Gaia greens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so there should not be a problem
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've covered, you do list the
details of your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to cover that because I
think I've answered your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonto wraps it up with, lastly,
I am very excited to tell you that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: ordered some of your genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boy, am I excited to see your grow with my
genetics in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I picked up some orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're watching the video, you can see
I'm wearing the orangegasm t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get that on my website at
iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on the, I think it says iree store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on that, get yourself an orangegasm
t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are orangegasm shirts, lemon jeffrey
t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are golden goat shirts on the
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an iree genetics logo t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a grow from your heart podcast
t-shirt up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe, just maybe by the time this
episode airs or a couple of days shortly
[SPEAKER_00]: thereafter, there will be brand new iree
army t-shirts available on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new iree army t-shirts are gray.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're supposed to be here Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, shipping is basically at a
standstill right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the tracking numbers have just stopped
updating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am rambling now, but get yourself some
iree genetics t-shirts and I will get back
[SPEAKER_00]: into Tonto's message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonto has got orangegasm, lemon jeffrey,
and strawberry starburst coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will start posting pics most likely
around the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard you last night on Instagram saying
no one ever follows through and I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, a lot of people say, hey,
I'm growing this strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say, send me pictures, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't get pictures of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few people do send me amazing pics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like Tonto is going to send me
some great pictures and I cannot wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, ah, where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't be the last, but I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have intentions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they won't be the best, but I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, pictures are pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows what you're going to send me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does say, I do have intentions of
starting my first breeding project
[SPEAKER_00]: sometime next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, from the bottom of my
heart, thank you for all that you do for
[SPEAKER_00]: this community and arming us new growers
with knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are ever up in Canada, please let
me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, from your friend Tonto.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Tonto, I may come visit you one day up
there in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never been to Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to go check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to go visit my friend, the dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of grows up there that
have invited me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one day, bro, you may need to,
uh, clear off some couch space,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of couch space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like six, five dude, but I'm narrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just need one couch space,
clear off some spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may need some place to crash one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get to smoke some of that great Canadian
herb with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Tonto, thank you for the great
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I answered all of your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I was quite rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And going quite fast, but I feel like this
was a good fun podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to wish you a happy holidays,
brother, you and your whole family,
[SPEAKER_00]: a happy holidays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everything goes well for you up
there in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got any more questions,
please do reach out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody else out there has any
questions, corrections, comments,
[SPEAKER_00]: or concerns, you can reach out as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is grow from your heart
at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do look forward to hearing from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do not be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also make sure to check out the website at
ireadgenetics.com all things
[SPEAKER_00]: ireadgenetics, Rasta Jeff, grow from your
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will all be right there on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find seed vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find a contact me tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have taken advantage of
that grow help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a grow question,
there are a few questions that I ask you
[SPEAKER_00]: on that website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what is the temperature of your room?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the humidity of your room?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you feeding the plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the pH of your last feed?
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I ask you those questions is
because when you say, Hey Rasta Jeff,
[SPEAKER_00]: my plant turned yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to send you another email that
asks you all of those questions anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I've skipped us both a step.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to tell me the details of your
room and of your problem before you can
[SPEAKER_00]: even send me the question that makes it
easier for both of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take advantage of the grow help tab on
ireadgenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me your grow questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will answer your questions.

but I feel like other people may learn
[SPEAKER_00]: something from, I will use it right here
on the podcast.
