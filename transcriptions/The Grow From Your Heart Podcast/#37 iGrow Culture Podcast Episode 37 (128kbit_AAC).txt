[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, what's up ladies and gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to episode number 37 of the I Grow
Culture podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's me again, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Joining me on the microphone today is
Jesse from Hygro.
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this episode, Jesse and I are going to
talk a little bit about building your grow
[SPEAKER_03]: space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, this may end up being a
multi-episode discussion because I know
[SPEAKER_03]: we're going to leave stuff out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to forget things.
[SPEAKER_03]: We took quite a few notes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We wrote quite a bit of stuff down and the
more I wrote, the more I feel like we were
[SPEAKER_03]: missing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to try to keep notes on
what we're missing while we go and we'll
[SPEAKER_03]: keep this conversation going.
[SPEAKER_03]: But before we get to that part,
we got to pay some bills.

[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's enough commercials for today.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get on with some show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse and I are here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last night, Jesse hosted a small gathering
for growers over at Hygro.
[SPEAKER_03]: The party was a huge success, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, had a great response,
great turnout.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was really stoked about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't really advertise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse didn't advertise much.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of a test run.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just wanted to kind of see what would
happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wanted to see what would happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had about 12 people there for most of
the evening.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say about 20 people showed up for the
peak of the night when Spence and Matty
[SPEAKER_03]: and Big Mike and Michael showed up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That made about 20 people in the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to everybody that came.
[SPEAKER_03]: The people that I met, the people that I
already knew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming and supporting something
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big huge thanks to Bert.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jesse and Hygro for letting us gather
in the store.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had some pizza.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had some pizza.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for feeding me, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last night was kind of just a test run to
see how many people we could get to show
[SPEAKER_03]: up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you plan on doing this more?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to set a date real soon for
next month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably on Monday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to make it like a monthly event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's invited?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can anybody come?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 21 and up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, anyone's invited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just come down to the store and ask for,
you know, info or whatever.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or didn't you, did you make a Facebook
page or anything for it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a Facebook event.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will on my, I don't think I can do it
from the iRead Genetics page or from the
[SPEAKER_03]: iGrow Culture page, but I can do it from
my personal, I'll make an event or I'll
[SPEAKER_03]: share Jesse's event as soon as the next
one comes up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll talk about it on the show and
we'll let you guys know.
[SPEAKER_03]: We hope to get more growers from the
Pueblo area coming out to the gathering.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll announce it for sure when we get it
figured out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully we can get some listeners out
there and meet the people.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can come shake our hands and we can
find out who we're talking to.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Armando, we want you to come to one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were talking about building your
grow rooms and last night there were
[SPEAKER_03]: actually some new growers at the party and
we got to help them build a pretty sweet
[SPEAKER_03]: room.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of nice to, they're like,
we don't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jesse and I looked at each other and
it was neat because we had the exact same
[SPEAKER_03]: idea in our heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're like, do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they pretty much are going to do that,
I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in this show, we're going to talk about
a few different ways to set up a grow
[SPEAKER_03]: space that is suitable for your production
needs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also found a comment on the Facebook
page that asks for guidance in building a
[SPEAKER_03]: space for $500.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a really tight budget for a grow
room, but I'll see what I can come up
[SPEAKER_03]: with.
[SPEAKER_03]: I Googled a few items to try to save some
pennies, but that's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had 500 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: How big is the space?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, she just said, help me out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Teach me how to build a space for 500
bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: She said she's on a very low budget.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have her Facebook comment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd have to read to remember exactly what
she said, but I think she's also disabled.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to have to build her
something that's not heavy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have an idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's accessible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to build like a PVC frame and
then wrap it in some sort of mylar type
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then maybe hang a small T5 light in
there and that'll get her going.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we'll talk more about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get that going.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once we get into the building,
the grow stuff a little more, let's talk
[SPEAKER_03]: about building grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a few things to consider when
you're going to plan your grow before you
[SPEAKER_03]: even go to the hardware store,
before you ever go to the hydro shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's stuff you got to think about.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first thing to think about in my
opinion is, is it legal where you are?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to help you break the law.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first part of this is move to a
location where cannabis is legal if you
[SPEAKER_03]: want to follow my rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't do this in an illegal state.
[SPEAKER_03]: Move to Colorado, go to California,
or even better, do what you can to get
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis legalized or decriminalized where
you are so that you can grow legally.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to be responsible for you
breaking the law.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you plan on breaking the law,
just change to another podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to go to, I don't want you to
go to jail for what I'm telling you,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you're going to do what you're going
to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next thing to think about,
understand the risk you're taking because
[SPEAKER_03]: if you're growing in a state that's not
legal, the consequences can be quite
[SPEAKER_03]: severe.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just you, you're putting at risk.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're growing in a house, everybody in
that house is in trouble.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have a family and you go to jail,
that's going to just cause a tidal wave of
[SPEAKER_03]: bullshit in your life.
[SPEAKER_03]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next thing that I would say to think
about is what are your realistic needs?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're committed, you're going to grow
some cannabis for yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are your realistic needs?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you need to grow for yourself,
your family, maybe a few patients,
[SPEAKER_03]: or are you trying to become the next big
production facility in your area?
[SPEAKER_03]: So my next idea would be set a goal and
kind of stick with that for a few cycles
[SPEAKER_03]: to see what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't, you're not going to know how
good of a grower or what kind of crop you
[SPEAKER_03]: get on the first grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stick with that, set something up,
stick with it for a couple of cycles,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then adjust to your needs after you've
gone a couple of rounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like don't run your first lap and then
think my shoes are too tight, my shoes are
[SPEAKER_03]: too loose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Run a couple of laps, see what you're good
at, then adjust.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my next thing to consider I would say
is does your location have viable
[SPEAKER_03]: electricity?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something Jesse really stressed on
when he got here to talk about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Running more than one or two thousand watt
lights in a room may require some
[SPEAKER_03]: electrical upgrades.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to be safe, if your breakers
are flipping and you're scrambling to keep
[SPEAKER_03]: everything running, that's when you're
creating a fire hazard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you don't want to be on the news for
burning down your house growing weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: In your experience, can you usually just
run like a thousand watt light,
[SPEAKER_03]: the blower that it requires, and a couple
of fans?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you have like a hydro bubbler or
whatever, is that pretty much what one
[SPEAKER_03]: room can do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most residential rooms have about 30 amps.
[SPEAKER_03]: A 30 amp breaker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's your, and if you're putting an
air conditioner in there, you're taking up
[SPEAKER_03]: half a breaker just with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The light takes up about half a breaker.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're flipping the breaker when you
turn on the dishwasher or whatever,
[SPEAKER_03]: have an electrician come and help you out.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of electricians.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, if you're in the Pueblo area,
I have an electrician that I will refer
[SPEAKER_03]: because he's looking for some work.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's off and he could use your job.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't burn down the house, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't burn down the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't create that fire hazard with
electricity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, if you're in an illegal state,
this is something I just thought of,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to have to have an excuse for
all that electricity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If your 1000 watt light is going to kick
your light bill up about $100 per month,
[SPEAKER_03]: an additional, like the light and the fan
and the blower it takes to run it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're looking about another $100 every
month.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're just a dude in an apartment or
something like that, that may spark some
[SPEAKER_03]: concerns.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might want to get a hot tub.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've heard of people using welding
equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just get something to kind of make it look
like you're doing something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put a bunch of table saws in the garage if
you've got that option.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, look like you have some more for
that power consumption to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Empty, empty saltwater fish tanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, all of that stuff,
I bet you they can tell that my timers are
[SPEAKER_03]: on 1212 over at the crow, you know,
and they're like, oh yeah, every day at
[SPEAKER_03]: eight o'clock, this guy kicks on thousands
of Watts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then every day at eight o'clock they
kick off.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not retarded.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry if retarded is an offensive word to
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So will you be able to ventilate your
space is the next thing I would think
[SPEAKER_03]: about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fresh air is super important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stale, stagnant, humid air is the number
one cause for power in a powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll also slow your growth and makes your
plants look ugly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Makes room stink.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to be able to walk into your grow
room and close your eyes and not smell
[SPEAKER_03]: pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want it to smell like a nice clean
room.
[SPEAKER_03]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to be able to ventilate that
space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number five on my list of things that you
should consider.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is your grow space safe and secure?
[SPEAKER_03]: You may need to hide your grow from the
landlord or your nosy in-laws that come
[SPEAKER_03]: over for dinner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you ready to live the grow life in
your house?
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't sound like a huge question,
but dude, when you've got pot plants in
[SPEAKER_03]: your house, your whole house will stink if
you don't have it under control.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might need some carbon filters.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might need an extra carbon filter or
two.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always have a carbon filter on the air
that is going out, the exhaust,
[SPEAKER_03]: but then also I'll hang a carbon filter
with the blower on it just right in the
[SPEAKER_03]: middle of the room on the ceiling to act
as a scrubber just to clean even more air
[SPEAKER_03]: and that eliminates more odor.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were talking about ONA gel last night.
[SPEAKER_03]: They sell ONA gels in like a plastic jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: They say to take the lid off and just
leave it sitting, but I actually poke
[SPEAKER_03]: little pencil size holes with the drill
right in the lid and then just let it sit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once it gets down to about a
third of the jar, I just add like a half a
[SPEAKER_03]: cup of water in there and shake it and it
rehydrates all the crystals and it lasts a
[SPEAKER_03]: little longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put those by your door, like your entryway
to your home or your entryway to wherever
[SPEAKER_03]: you're growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people's nose will hit that first.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now their nose has already kind of,
they've been punched, so they're confused.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when they smell the herb, they won't
know that it's herb, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can put them in inside your ducting
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll blow that, move that odor around
instead of the cannabis odor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to add a random side note.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just a really random sidebar
because I just thought about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep hearing a lot of people say the
word marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: Marijuana is a racist word and it sounds
bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are afraid of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis is the new word.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis sounds better.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't sound as racist.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that's a weird way to put it,
but we were taught that marijuana is the
[SPEAKER_03]: devil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you smoke marijuana, you're going
to get crazy and rape white bitches.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis will heal you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis stops cancer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we should just try to abandon
the word marijuana and say cannabis a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: more.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just my random sidebar for the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana actually literally is a racist
word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't doubt that people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was invented by the government.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a huge history lesson.
[SPEAKER_01]: To discriminate against Mexicans.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't like the Mexicans that were
coming to America and smoking marihuanas
[SPEAKER_03]: and then bringing it to the jazz
musicians.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all Reefer madness here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, hopefully you know about that
already and hopefully, hopefully you're
[SPEAKER_03]: not that brainwashed and you never paid
attention to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully you just call it cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Safe and secure grow space, live in the
grow life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another big thing to consider is the
location of your grow inside of your house
[SPEAKER_03]: or wherever you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The basement is generally the coolest
spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're insulated by dirt and concrete
walls in your underground.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't get a lot of climate changes
there in the basement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, hopefully you don't get a lot of
traffic down there in the basement.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got like one room in the corner in the
back or something you can just dedicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: The attic is going to get hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: The attic is the top of the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting hit by the sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have all this insulation from
the dirt and the concrete walls.
[SPEAKER_03]: The attic is going to be a little more
challenging.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're going to need more cooling
power.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have to adjust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your snow melts off the, or the snow melts
off your roof in the middle of the winter
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's the only house in the
neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're the only house that your roof is
clean because you just melt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had to make an adjustment because I
noticed that I was melting snow somewhere
[SPEAKER_03]: one year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, oh, that's obvious as shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also guys, this is something we'll cover a
little later, but I want to jump to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have to get water there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So putting your plants in the attic,
once you get all the grow equipment hung
[SPEAKER_03]: up up there and everything's up there,
now you have to get water up there often.
[SPEAKER_03]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then another, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got something to add?
[SPEAKER_01]: Attic's just, if you can avoid it,
it's just really not a good place to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually a pretty good fire hazard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean a significant fire hazard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So avoid the attic at all costs.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're in like Wisconsin or something
though, and you can't really do it like we
[SPEAKER_03]: can here in Colorado, nobody goes to
anybody else's attic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that may be someone's only option.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys, like we were talking about earlier,
be safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know this sounds cheesy as hell,
but safety first, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to be on the news for
burning down your house, growing pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when the news comes, you might've
been growing legal medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: but as soon as that fire starts and the
news truck pulls out, you've got a drug
[SPEAKER_03]: lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to be polite.
[SPEAKER_03]: This medical marijuana provider
accidentally sparked fire to his home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the report's going to say,
we're here in front of this house where
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a major drug lab on fire right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what the reports.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're going to be the asshole that
just went to jail for doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a nice news voice.
[SPEAKER_03]: You like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounded really weird in the headphones.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to bail on it kind of quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, try to go lower in the house is
better.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Pueblo, they're trying to actually push
an ordinance where we have to grow in an
[SPEAKER_03]: outbuilding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was reading a book doing research on
this and in Jorge Cervantes book,
[SPEAKER_03]: he says outbuildings are actually the
worst place you could think about growing
[SPEAKER_03]: because that's where thieves are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the cops don't consider that
trespassing so they can go into your
[SPEAKER_03]: outbuilding.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not part of your home.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the cops can walk right in.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not, it's a different rule.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's not part of your domicile.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a shed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they can walk right into that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't need a warrant.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something we got to, remind all the
people that are opposed to this of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike, did you just hear that bro?
[SPEAKER_03]: Your outbuilding that they're trying to
propose that we build will not be part of
[SPEAKER_03]: your home.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it will not require a warrant is what
this book that Jorge Cervantes wrote says.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me know how that really works.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's my legal counsel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grown in a shed has a lot of challenges
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to be a lot like grown in an
attic as far as trying to insulate it and
[SPEAKER_01]: cool it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be very difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess I should, one more thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next step here is how are you going to
cool the room?
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep in mind that you have to use more
electricity for that air conditioner and
[SPEAKER_03]: the air conditioner has to vent itself
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you keep in mind how you're going to
cool the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a good point that I wanted to make
and it just left my head.
[SPEAKER_03]: What were you just telling me?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that with the, with the sheds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the sheds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: What our goal is, I guess I should have
covered this more in the beginning,
[SPEAKER_03]: but your goal when you're building a grow
room, you want as much control of the
[SPEAKER_03]: lights, the air, the water, the humidity,
the temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to build a room that we can
control to set the ideal climate for these
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we should instead of just starting
building a room, we should know what we're
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to build.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want a room that you can almost
automate and let that happen and just turn
[SPEAKER_03]: everything on properly, get everything set
up properly and let it run.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when the nighttime comes,
you have a nighttime temperature selected.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll get to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: When the daytime comes again, you have a
daytime temp selected.
[SPEAKER_03]: The air conditioner kicks on at the right
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your fans move at the right time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your blowers are all at the right
schedule.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you can hit that perfect,
like 50% humidity or 40% humidity mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get your 77 degree mark in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get it all perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have just a little bit of wind.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're trying to build that super happy,
trying to build an aquarium for your
[SPEAKER_03]: plants or like a cage for plants,
like the perfect habitat for these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: A subclimate inside your house?
[SPEAKER_03]: Inside your house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's your goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I should have talked more about
that at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you achieve that, you know,
pretty dialed in perfect climate,
[SPEAKER_01]: growing becomes a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot, lot easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: The room is the room, the genetics,
what you're feeding and then the grow,
[SPEAKER_03]: like how you grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty much what your components
are.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lights, air, water, soil and love,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cleanliness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cleanliness is next.
[SPEAKER_03]: Godliness when it comes to growing every
little piece of trash or scrap and not
[SPEAKER_03]: just in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_03]: If your grow room is in like your mom's
basement or your grandma's attic or your
[SPEAKER_03]: bedroom closet, all of those clothes,
all those books, all those scraps of
[SPEAKER_03]: paper, all those cigarette butts,
all the dust, that's all a place for a
[SPEAKER_03]: spider mite to hide.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all a place for a thrip to lay a
bug.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, all that dust and cigarette smoke
will end up in your concentrate and in
[SPEAKER_03]: your flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've kind of stopped sweeping my grow room
now after about week six because I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: want to stir up the dust and put it in my
flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will let my grow room look a little
shitty on the floor for a week to not
[SPEAKER_03]: sweep it up as often.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll turn off all the fans and blowers
and air conditioners now to sweep up
[SPEAKER_03]: because I don't want that sticking to my
buds because that ends up in the hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're trying to make the best hash we
can now.
[SPEAKER_03]: That seems to be the point that
everybody's headed to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still try to grow the best flowers,
but of course we want the best hash to go
[SPEAKER_03]: with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a long rant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than things to consider,
there are responsibilities that I think
[SPEAKER_03]: you should practice being a good grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're setting up to grow,
you don't want to piss off the neighbors.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to attract unwanted
attention by thieves or thugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to get cop attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something people don't think
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are kids out there that love to
steal pot plants now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kids are getting braver.
[SPEAKER_03]: The younger kids are getting dumber and
braver.
[SPEAKER_03]: They know what pot is.
[SPEAKER_03]: They know how to find a grow and they want
to steal your shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So keep the pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are also innocent kids that will
just see your pot and want to steal it
[SPEAKER_03]: just because they're curious.
[SPEAKER_03]: So be careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep your pot away from the kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I stress that, but I'm a father.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't want my kid finding your pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I needed a drink.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a long rant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of the responsibilities that I
think, and I want to thank my friends on
[SPEAKER_03]: Facebook for helping me out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I asked for a couple of pieces of advice
on this topic and a few people chimed in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I owe a huge shout out to Mr. Chris
Barkowitz.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys know Chris Barkowitz,
you'll know why this is funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can Google his name if you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: I asked Chris Barkowitz, or asked on
Facebook, what would be a few things you
[SPEAKER_03]: could do to be a responsible grower and
not get yourself in trouble?
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris's reply was, don't do interviews.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the golden answer right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris is finally free after that interview
and welcome home, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: You look good in that iRegenetics t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a few responsibilities being a grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure your lights are not visible from
the outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you set up your grow room and the sun
goes down, turn on all your grow lights,
[SPEAKER_03]: walk outside, whatever, if you're in the
basement, attic, bedroom, walk outside and
[SPEAKER_03]: see if you can see your grow lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can see your grow lights,
fix it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're failing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: That also means you have a light leak.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That means the lights are getting in
during your flowering cycle, which you're
[SPEAKER_03]: just going to cause a bunch of
hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, your next responsibility,
make sure the blowers and fans are not
[SPEAKER_03]: heard by neighbors or people walking past
your grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's a spot where you don't think
people will ever walk, the day you build a
[SPEAKER_03]: damn grow, someone's going to walk there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The meter made, the gas guy, some kid
chasing his dog, some cop looking for
[SPEAKER_03]: someone else.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to walk right past that
blower and they're going to go,
[SPEAKER_03]: what is this?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're going to think no one's ever
going to walk there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as soon as you put a blower there,
dude, they will.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the way life works.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just be careful, plan ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure no one can hear your blowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure no one can see your lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's ways to muffle, even to insulating
the duct, insulating the blower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can disguise outlets as a dryer
outlet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can try to put it through the roof.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just move the blower to the other end of
the chain so it's not so noisy,
[SPEAKER_03]: not right at the window.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those mufflers are a great idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're actually available at a high grow
window or growing supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually a cheaper alternative to the
mufflers and better for your grow is a
[SPEAKER_01]: HEPA filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's sucking in, those will help.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over all of my ends, where I've drilled
six inch holes or eight inch holes to have
[SPEAKER_03]: my ends coming in, I get those little
square HEPA filters that are just a sheet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess they're a rectangle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just staple those right over it with
a staple gun onto the wall.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wherever I do a grow, that keeps your bugs
out, keeps all this stuff that you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: want in your hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: It keeps all that out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Filter everything twice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Twice, if you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are going, oh my God, how much is
this going to cost?
[SPEAKER_03]: Building a good grow room does cost a
little bit of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: People were asking last night,
they're like, we've got this much budget.
[SPEAKER_03]: Should we buy better this or better this?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of where I think you
should get the best bulbs and ballasts you
[SPEAKER_03]: can.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's your first start.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then move your air.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if you have to buy in chunks,
I think you buy the lights and then your
[SPEAKER_03]: air moving stuff, like your ducting,
your blowers, and then your air
[SPEAKER_03]: conditioner.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you buy your pots and soil and
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Start with the room and just buy slowly
instead of but yeah, it's all about
[SPEAKER_03]: choosing where the weakest link is always
going to be the weakest link.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to decide where to pinch your
budget there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get the good bulbs and good ballasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's definitely my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's a big issue that we've been
dealing with here in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of our new laws here that are being
proposed in Pueblo are because of this
[SPEAKER_03]: issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure nobody can smell your grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: The smell is the most offensive and
revealing part of your grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I said offensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some people that do not love the
smell of sweet sweet sticky ganja in the
[SPEAKER_03]: morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a guy here in our city that keeps
complaining to city council that he can
[SPEAKER_03]: smell pot every day when he wakes up
because his neighbors are growing the
[SPEAKER_03]: dank.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a fan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep that smell down.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you build your grow discreetly and you
don't bring attention to yourself,
[SPEAKER_03]: your neighbors will never know you've got
to grow in your home.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a security issue too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just inviting people in,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only thieves but moochies.
[SPEAKER_03]: You make more friends than you've ever
wanted when people find out you grow weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I get one of those buds?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you talking about, man?
[SPEAKER_03]: What buds?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a dead skunk in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking dog gets sprayed again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Several years ago I lived in another house
and I had a grow in the basement there and
[SPEAKER_03]: the power went out and I was mid flower so
it stinks, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: The power guys had to come through
everybody's backyard looking for the
[SPEAKER_03]: problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't at the place but my girlfriend
was there and the power guy told my
[SPEAKER_03]: girlfriend, ma'am, I'd go in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smells like you got a skunk in the
backyard.
[SPEAKER_03]: He could smell my grow completely and she
just made a cringing face and went in the
[SPEAKER_03]: house and told me about it later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if you can't smell it, people can
smell your grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're around it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You sleep by it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You wake up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're smoking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're the last person that's going to
smell it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The church lady down the block can smell
it down the street.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't let anybody smell your grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's step number four to be a good
responsible grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're building a grow room,
do whatever it takes to make sure no kids
[SPEAKER_03]: ever get into your grow space.
[SPEAKER_03]: I stuttered when I said that because I
mean it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure no kids ever get into your grow
space.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's important.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the biggest black eye you can put
on the cannabis community right now is
[SPEAKER_03]: letting kids get caught with your weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's something you might not think
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the stuff was kind of obvious,
but here's a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to create a lot of waste.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's growing plants in your house.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have plant stems and
stocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have root balls.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find a responsible way to dispose of
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of you guys live out in the rural
areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Burn that shit if you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Compost it if you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I live in the city and my grow is in
a city facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all got to be chopped up into little
tiny pieces and put into secured trash
[SPEAKER_03]: bags and it's got to be destroyed on site.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other guys, you're going to have to
find what if the trash guy is dumping your
[SPEAKER_03]: trash and finds all your pot leaves in
Connecticut when you're growing pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: What if he's not cool?
[SPEAKER_03]: What if he is cool?
[SPEAKER_03]: Then he's going to want your weed and he's
going to rob you.
[SPEAKER_03]: If he's not cool, he's calling the cops.
[SPEAKER_03]: So be careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: They might find your trash.
[SPEAKER_03]: They cannot, from Jorge's book that I
read, they cannot start a case based on
[SPEAKER_03]: your trash that does not justify a search
warrant, but the trash can be used in
[SPEAKER_03]: court as part of the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: So keep an eye on the trash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually know people, I lived in
Lawrence, Kansas, and now that I think
[SPEAKER_03]: about it, I know people that got busted
and had their trash used as evidence in
[SPEAKER_03]: court.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that I think about it, I can't
remember their names, but a couple of kids
[SPEAKER_03]: I worked at a place with, what's up guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard that for drug dealing cases
back in the day and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find that tape they wrap around the
packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had that happen to a friend too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I worked at a bowling alley and I found a
bunch of that tape, that dark colored
[SPEAKER_03]: tape, and you could tell it was wrapped
around like a, I've seen plenty of pounds
[SPEAKER_03]: of weed break like pounds of weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it was wrapped around weed
or some cocaine or something, but it was
[SPEAKER_03]: that kind of tape.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know exactly somebody had a nice
bulk of something in my bowling alley one
[SPEAKER_03]: night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You found that in the trash at the bowling
alley?
[SPEAKER_03]: In the trash in the bathroom, just sitting
on the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're telling me that someone at
evidence lockup may have been crooked?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not the evidence tape.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be a lot cooler.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know that like brown tape they wrapped
the kilos with?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a bunch of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So somebody had a kilo of coke or a pound
of weed in the bowling alley.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which isn't really surprising now that I'm
thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bowling alleys are kind of sketchy places
that people don't think about.
[SPEAKER_03]: So think about what you guys are going to
do with your trash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys, you got a bunch of shit that you're
going to have to throw away and not look
[SPEAKER_03]: obvious with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got more than two lights,
when you harvest four lights worth of
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff, three lights worth of stuff,
that's a lot of trash to take care of.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't know what to do,
if you don't know how to recycle and
[SPEAKER_03]: compost your soil, you've got soil to deal
with too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got perlite in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got old nutrients in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to be careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's another one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep your yard and house clean and
presentable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't give your neighbors or anyone in the
neighborhood a reason to dislike you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't stand out.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the house is on your block,
get the lawn mowed once a week,
[SPEAKER_03]: go mow the lawn once a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they got flowers grown outside and it's
a bunch of yuppies, look like a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: yuppies and grow flowers outside,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to fit in the best you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just don't be the neighborhood asshole if
you're going to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Help out.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it snows, shovel the extra house in
front or house next door on each side of
[SPEAKER_03]: you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just do what you can to kind of be
friendly.
[SPEAKER_03]: A friend of mine, Amanda, on Facebook said
she actually just moved into a new house
[SPEAKER_03]: and she's building her grow in there in a
legal state, so I can talk about her.
[SPEAKER_03]: She said she walked to her neighbors on
either side and introduced herself and
[SPEAKER_03]: said, hey, my name's Amanda.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the new neighbor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my phone number.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you ever have any problems,
feel free to call me.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys ever want to hang out,
just let me know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So by making friends and giving them her
number, she's done two things.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they get pissed off at her,
they won't call the cops.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll call her or they'll come over and
be like, hey, dude, your Grateful Dead
[SPEAKER_03]: music's too damn loud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hippies chill out with the drum
circle in here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Amanda.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you're listening to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then she'll stop, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also if something's wrong,
they don't have to call 911.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can call her and be like,
your house is glowing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's a bunch of light coming from
the basement window.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your curtain fell.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's happening?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they don't have to get to the cops
right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just be a good neighbor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Introduce yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be social.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number seven, we've talked about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't burn the place down and make us all
look like assholes.
[SPEAKER_03]: This cannabis revolution is new.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are tons of people who hate the
movement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fox News hates us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anytime some dipshit burns down a house by
blasting indoors or overpowering his
[SPEAKER_03]: breaker box, it makes the entire movement
look stupid.
[SPEAKER_03]: So please guys, don't be the asshole we
see on Fox News.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said earlier, they're not going to
say this medical marijuana provider had a
[SPEAKER_03]: snafu.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to say this drug lab erupted
in flames.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're going to be on the news and
handcuffs in the back of a cop car looking
[SPEAKER_03]: like a dipshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't be that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no reason to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow equipment is pretty cheap nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't use some sketchy asshole shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're running a bunch of lights,
get yourself a power box, plug it into the
[SPEAKER_03]: 240 and plug all the lights into that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're pretty much legit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can run like eight lights on that
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nine or 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen like 16 light ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And electrical upgrades aren't really that
expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're going nuts, you know,
do it the right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't run extension cords all over the
damn place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Each extension cord is a fire hazard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Each one.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you need electrical upgrades,
guys, just call.
[SPEAKER_03]: Craigslist is filled with electricians
that advertise that they're MMJ friendly
[SPEAKER_03]: or 420 friendly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get one of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get one of those guys to come wire up your
shit, because when they do it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you'll be so impressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks so cool to have your stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first time you get a professionally
wired up grow room, you got the wire going
[SPEAKER_03]: like the little conduit going all the way
across the room with the box every like
[SPEAKER_03]: eight feet or six feet for a plugin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then like a big, one big breaker box
on the outside of the room that you could
[SPEAKER_03]: shut everything off so that, you know,
you can work on shit and not get any
[SPEAKER_03]: electricity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, that is so sweet looking the first
time you get that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So have a pro come do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find them on Craigslist if you need to.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're in the Southern Colorado area,
I've got a guy, I got two guys for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if this first guy is busy, we can send
his, his old boss to come help you out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, don't burn the shit down.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no, yeah, no reason for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should be, you know, one of the
number one things when you're setting up a
[SPEAKER_01]: grow room is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys, I always add a fire extinguisher and
a smoke alarm.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put a smoke detector in the grow rooms,
put it near the, the exhaust fan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you've got a carbon filter sucking
air out, put it near there because the
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke is going to get sucked toward that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That way, put the smoke alarm there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put a fire extinguisher outside of the
damn grow room because you don't want to
[SPEAKER_03]: have to run in there and get the
extinguisher.
[SPEAKER_03]: If that room is on fire, you want to be
able to kick in the door and just start
[SPEAKER_03]: spraying that shit at high grow indoor
growing supplies.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can pick up an item called the flame
defender.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't used it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done a lot of research about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those look like the way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're going to get ourselves set
up with those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll test them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully we never have to test them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully we never find out how good those
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So guys, once you figured out how much
herb you need to produce, that's when you
[SPEAKER_03]: can start designing your grow space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, sometimes your space dictates
how you build your grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where, that's where the fun kicks
in, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Building a grow is all about adapting to
the space you're provided.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of you guys are going to use a small
closet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of you might use a spare bedroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of you guys are going to buy a grow
hut and set that up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will do a lot of talking about a grow
hut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe not on this episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're already 35 minutes in, but I will
definitely, I'm writing that down,
[SPEAKER_03]: grow hut.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very versatile.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people made fun of them at first,
but I have done some breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done some phenose selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done some great growing and just a
grow hut.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're great.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have limited space, you could put
it in the corner of your bedroom and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a whole bedroom full of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a quite the little production
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_03]: So since I'm only allowed a small plant
count here in Pueblo in my house and a
[SPEAKER_03]: spare bedroom, I run two, five by five.
[SPEAKER_03]: Five hydro huts on a flip box with a 600
watt light in each hut.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what happens, I run one ballast.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ballast plugs into the wall on a
timer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it goes ballast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's a cord that goes to the
flip box.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the flip box has two cords that
come out and a bulb comes from each one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every 12 hours side a lights up and
then for 12 hours it stays on and then it
[SPEAKER_03]: shuts off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other side comes on for 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: So instead of adding electrical upgrades
to that bedroom that I'm just using in the
[SPEAKER_03]: winter as a grow space for the,
it keeps the house warm up here actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just run that using the flip box.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can use that room all the time and have
it flowering constantly and not have any
[SPEAKER_03]: downtime in that room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like an 11 or it's like a 14 by
nine room.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those two, five by five huts fit
perfectly in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it gives me a little bit of room to
work because I really liked the grow huts.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people talk shit about them and
hate on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my friend that was doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't have the flip box, but he had
two different ballasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was, you know, one was on for 12
hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other was on for 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just had the extra ballast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't want to go buy another one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like that flip box was the price of
another ballast and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, I'll just do it this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was, it's kind of a test idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to see if I could do that on a
larger scale because I've designed an 18
[SPEAKER_03]: light room.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's two nine room or two nine light
rooms on a flip box.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I actually did some research and
a guy named Eric Bixa kind of beat me to
[SPEAKER_03]: the punch on this room that I was trying
to build.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a cool room.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a 10 by 10 room with a 10 by five
lung room in the middle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of your equipment is in that
middle room and you cool off all of the
[SPEAKER_03]: air in the middle room and one side
sleeps.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're producing CO2 in the sleeping
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys plants that are asleep kick off CO2.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can vent that CO2 into your flower
room that's awake, you can use that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so yeah, you're just, you got one air
conditioner, one set of ballast,
[SPEAKER_03]: one dehumidifier, and then you're just
moving the air around in both rooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Killer idea guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a huge room.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like multi-thousand dollar room.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of you guys are going to grow like
in closets and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm saying, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of you guys are going to grow and
grow huts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of you guys might even bust out 16
lights in a basement.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, however you do it, there will be
some obstacles presented by your existing
[SPEAKER_03]: environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you're building a building that's
designed to be a grow space from the
[SPEAKER_03]: beginning, you're going to have to deal
with some type of obstacles.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's part of the fun for me,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like taking a space like a dirty
basement or a funky attic or the back part
[SPEAKER_03]: of the dispensary and making it an
amazing, sufficient grow with the space
[SPEAKER_03]: and power that I've got without having to
do any crazy, dramatic improvements to the
[SPEAKER_03]: place.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a fun challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I, no, I don't think I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do upgrades after every single run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes upgrades that slow me down quite
a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've had some downtime for a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard you talking about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's talk about a few things that
every grow will need.
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be more things you're going to
have to add to this depending on your room
[SPEAKER_03]: and your space, but every room is going to
need these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is mostly for just one flowering
room.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to have plants vegging while
your crop flowers, you're going to need a
[SPEAKER_03]: small veg room also.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eventually you're going to want a mother
room and a clone area and a veg area and a
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding area and a place for your male
plants and a place to make pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets ridiculous when you start doing it
a whole bunch, but eventually you're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to want to add more rooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: My advice is build slowly and plan ahead
with realistic expectations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't start counting your chickens before
they hatch.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got a light and you expect a
pound of weed, start thinking you got
[SPEAKER_03]: three quarters of a pound of weed and
budget for that because you're not going
[SPEAKER_03]: to grow as great as you plan your first
couple of runs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So make your upgrades.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Jesse said, he makes upgrades every
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of plan them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't go too ambitious your first couple
of times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be realistic about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can fail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crops fail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things that kill crops, spider mites,
air conditioner failure.
[SPEAKER_03]: If your air conditioner cuts out in the
middle of a flower cycle and you're at
[SPEAKER_03]: work and it's 90 degrees outside and
you're going to come home and it's going
[SPEAKER_03]: to be 108 degrees in your grow room and
you're going to have crispy buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're already dried and cured for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That shit happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're running a hydro setup,
if one pump dies while you're at work or
[SPEAKER_03]: while you're asleep, everything can go
crunchy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me started on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a mutual friend that went to Las
Vegas for two days.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was supposed to go to a wedding and
didn't want to go, but he had to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a five-day vacation planned,
but he went for two days.
[SPEAKER_03]: He flew there and flew back right away and
came home and his pump took a shit while
[SPEAKER_03]: he was gone and his whole four-by-four
table done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a double redundancy setup,
two pumps on a setup at a dispensary and
[SPEAKER_01]: both failed the same weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone was at the Canada's Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Goodbye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two tables worth of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two whole tables.
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: See?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I've been trying that for a while too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just sounds like a better word.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Herb.
[SPEAKER_03]: I call it herb a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Rasta in me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good herb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're talking about things that all
grows need.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every grow is going to need electricity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Duh, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you're growing outside,
you need electricity.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to need lights and timers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll need intake and outtake fans,
and you're going to need a water source.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the basics that every grow will
need.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're at 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to try to squeeze as much of
this in as we can, but we might not
[SPEAKER_03]: actually even get to the build part until
another episode because I have another
[SPEAKER_03]: episode planned that is just, I've had
news articles set aside.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a couple of things Mike and I
wanted to talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to kind of go between these two
build episodes, I think, but I might put
[SPEAKER_03]: it out as like a midweek episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think after we record here,
Mike's going to come over and bullshit
[SPEAKER_03]: with me again and talk about some things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next one will be a news heavy catch
up episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'll try to get Jesse back as
soon as possible to talk more about
[SPEAKER_03]: building.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you're going to send me so many
questions I can already tell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We love the questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: That means we're doing our job.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we spark your thoughts, that means
we're doing our job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey LB, you asked me questions and I
appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope I have responded appropriately.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to say your full name because
I haven't gotten your permission,
[SPEAKER_03]: but LB, I appreciate you for listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So lights, everybody needs lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lights are actually the main ingredient to
your grow space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lights dictate the cycles of the gardens.
[SPEAKER_03]: They tell you if you're in veg or if
you're in flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lights are also the main fuel and energy
provider for your plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lights create photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lights are the main thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the number one nutrient.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put as big of a light as you can in your
space is what I always say.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So no matter how big or small your grow
space is, you will need some sort of air
[SPEAKER_03]: exchange system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to get rid of that old,
stale, funky air.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't stress how important this is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the problems I see from low budget
grows is a lack of air flow and air
[SPEAKER_03]: exchange.
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving the air around the room is great,
but you need to replace the room,
[SPEAKER_03]: the air in the room also.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you leave a freshly watered crop locked
in a sealed closet with a light above it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're creating a very humid environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plants are trying to transpire,
but there's too much moisture in the air
[SPEAKER_03]: and the plants can't sweat like they
should, which slows down photosynthesis
[SPEAKER_03]: and stunts growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: That also makes your plants look angry and
sad too.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the plants are left in excessive
humidity for long periods, they will
[SPEAKER_03]: become very susceptible to our good
friend, powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: F you, powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: As your buds grow, your risk of powdery
mildew way increases.
[SPEAKER_03]: The insides of your buds, if you're not
getting some air flow in there and you got
[SPEAKER_03]: too much moisture in the room,
that mold is going to grow right in the
[SPEAKER_03]: middle of your buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lock yourself in your car one day,
just lock yourself in the car in the sun
[SPEAKER_03]: and just try to sit in there and breathe
for the whole day.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it feels like for your plants
when you just stifle them locked up in a
[SPEAKER_03]: tight room.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good way to put it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've stressed the need for air exchange.
[SPEAKER_03]: Water should be easily accessible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I predict that each thousand watt light
will require about five gallons of water
[SPEAKER_03]: two to three times a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: This works across the board.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to put 16 three gallon pots under
the light, or I like to put nine five
[SPEAKER_03]: gallon pots or between four and six,
seven gallon pots underneath a thousand
[SPEAKER_03]: watt light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Either way, I find that that requires
about five gallons of water for each
[SPEAKER_03]: watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a real good estimate
actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad that works out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep that in mind that you guys are going
to have to get water to your grow space at
[SPEAKER_03]: least twice a week unless you set up a
drip system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Late in flower, and if your room is a
little hotter, you may be watering three
[SPEAKER_03]: or four times a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hitting my plants is a little cool
now, so I'm hitting them Monday.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hit them with nutrients real heavy,
and then I try to hit them on Thursday or
[SPEAKER_03]: Friday with just enough water to keep them
through Monday.
[SPEAKER_03]: But since they haven't been drinking a
lot, that means that on their next day
[SPEAKER_03]: when they get just water, I'm going to
really water the shit out of them to kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of wash out any excess nutrients that have
built up over time, and then we'll start
[SPEAKER_03]: refeeding the soil again around day 30.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really pummel them with a lot of sugars
and things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And smaller plants will use water a lot
more often too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, that mic stand is fired after its
performance tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a mic stand that needs Viagra.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll swap it out for that one over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry about giving you the shitty mic
stand.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got to talk to our sponsors about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys are interested in sponsoring
the iGrowCulture podcast, email me
[SPEAKER_03]: iGrowCulture at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to hear what you have to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll send you a one sheet if that's what
you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll let you know what my rates are.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been hitting, dude, we've been
hitting between 3,000 and 5,000 listeners
[SPEAKER_03]: per episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: 5,000 is our peak.
[SPEAKER_03]: 2,500 is like our low on an episode now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how many people are hearing this
show.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank each and every one of you that
are listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like we've talked about the very
basics of building a room.
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about setting a goal for how
much cannabis we need to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wrote herb right here, but I corrected
myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next step is figuring out if you're
building your room to fit your production
[SPEAKER_03]: needs, or if you're building the room to
fit the available space, budget,
[SPEAKER_03]: and electrical limitations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you can't always throw 24 lights
in your basement because you can't pull
[SPEAKER_03]: that many amps.
[SPEAKER_03]: So find a happy medium that lets you grow
a few crops, and then see if this is
[SPEAKER_03]: something that you can dedicate more time
and space and electricity to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after a couple of crops,
expand your grows, plant them out,
[SPEAKER_03]: but don't expand more quickly than you can
learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep saying that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine this, imagine getting ahead of
yourself will cause you headaches in the
[SPEAKER_03]: future.
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine if you have 24 lights and flower,
with six, seven gallon pots under each
[SPEAKER_03]: light, and now you have fungus gnats,
and it's your first grow, and you're like
[SPEAKER_03]: four weeks into flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't spray, because if you spray,
you're going to put shit in your buds,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you've got to get rid of those fungus
gnats.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you got a whole lot of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just spent, if you got 24 lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like 150 plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be 24 to 30 pounds of weed if
you do this, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Some guys are going to get 48 pounds of
weed out of these 24 lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're running some OG Kush or Girl
Scout cookies, you're hoping for those 25
[SPEAKER_03]: pounds out of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now you may have to cut it down four
weeks in.
[SPEAKER_03]: What if you got spider mites in there?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm cringing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I'm saying is start small,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fail small before you fail so large,
because when you grow, you're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: fail.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mess up at this rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still kill stuff on accident.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's the only way I learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: I encourage a little bit of experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't experiment on your mom's.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't experiment on your patient's
important crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pick a plant, torture it, see what you can
do to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But go small.
[SPEAKER_03]: Experience a few problems before you try
to battle fungus gnats in a 24 light
[SPEAKER_03]: flowering room.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are 47 minutes in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if we should try to keep
going or if we should save this next part
[SPEAKER_03]: for another episode, because we kind of
got them on the edge of their seats right
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk about this one spot right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to talk a little bit about
room size in relation to how many and what
[SPEAKER_03]: type of lights to use.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got about 10 minutes to do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a small closet set up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would use some small T5 lights,
little fluorescent lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally don't like the coiled CFLs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't feel like they put out enough
light.
[SPEAKER_03]: They work great as supplements.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's all you've got and all you can
power, it's going to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for the amount of heat that they put
off, I don't think they put off enough
[SPEAKER_03]: light.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: For a closet, I would almost recommend
it's a T5 light.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there are eight bulbs and I think
it's 24 by 24 is the dimensions of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's actually made by
Hydrofarm.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got a small closet, that is the
perfect light, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can't run a lot of electricity,
you can put that in a small fan and leave
[SPEAKER_03]: the closet cracked a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to grow room, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as you're getting that stale air
out of there and not letting it get too
[SPEAKER_03]: hot, keep those T5 lights right above your
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then every night you got to close that
closet door at the same time and turn off
[SPEAKER_03]: your light to start your flower cycle and
you got to be on the money, eight o'clock,
[SPEAKER_03]: eight o'clock every day and night.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in a small closet, I think that little
T5 light I'm talking about is perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe a small HID, a high intensity
discharge light, maybe like a 150 in a
[SPEAKER_03]: closet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like a 250 watt high pressure
sodium light.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really find those to be efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are cool lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great size light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't take a lot of wattage,
but it does make a little bit of heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if your closet's a little bigger,
400s are great.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exactly what I wrote down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say a 400 is kind of the
biggest you really want to go in a closet
[SPEAKER_03]: unless you got like one of those fancy,
like Bel Air walk-in closets.
[SPEAKER_03]: But everyone's got a small closet they can
dedicate to a grow space.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're just trying to supply herb
for you and your girlfriend or something,
[SPEAKER_03]: or your patient, just you, the closet is
fine, especially with the little T5 light.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you could pull some stuff out of a
T5.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that where your first grow was at,
in a closet?
[SPEAKER_03]: Technically, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was in a closet, but inside of that
closet, I put a grow hut in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of a large closet.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was more of a, it was a closet that was
actually attached to the hot water heater
[SPEAKER_03]: area.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the closet had another door in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I actually took the ducting from my
hot water heater and my heater and used
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the CO2 to my grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can be a little dangerous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do that if you don't know what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, perfect little closet.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great way to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can grow a little short plants in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can supply yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: A small corner of a room works.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you need to like tarp off a room or
like if you have a small room that you can
[SPEAKER_03]: just take the corner, you can put a grow
hut in the corner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grow huts are awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, I'm going to do a whole talk about
those.
[SPEAKER_03]: That will be another episode, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're at 50 minutes now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've noticed you guys don't listen past
45.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the listeners click out at 45
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're droning off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're not droning on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I meant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't mean I meant enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: After a while, if we listen to the show,
I can tell we run out of energy about an
[SPEAKER_03]: hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, oh, my throat's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the listeners are getting drowsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I meant to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't blame you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you got that small corner, small space.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can put a T5 all the way up to like a
600 watt light in like a six by six space
[SPEAKER_03]: if you can vent it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk in the next episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse is actually like a carpenter,
craftsman, house builder, manly man.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's going to talk about framing up a
space and stuff in the next episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to try to get this part done
quickly here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grow huts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will talk a lot about them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can put a grow hut in the corner of
any room.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can put multiple grow huts in a
basement.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can put one grow hut in every room.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got limited power, find out
where each room is on each breaker and put
[SPEAKER_03]: one grow hut on each breaker.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can grow plenty of cannabis in one
house or one location.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like my kind of place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think I've been to houses like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then of course there's the whole dedicated
bedroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got a nice bedroom that nobody
needs, if you're a single guy and your
[SPEAKER_03]: roommate sucks, kick him out and build a
grow room.
[SPEAKER_03]: He won't eat your food.
[SPEAKER_03]: He won't bring over ugly chicks.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a grow room in there now that's
going to produce dank cannabis and it will
[SPEAKER_03]: pay for itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something I should write down to talk
about is the cost of running the grow room
[SPEAKER_03]: because that's just on my mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had more paper here and I don't know
where the note I wrote earlier went,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we'll write that right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big grow rooms, big facilities and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Astronomical electricity bills.
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine if you and I were roommates and
you kicked me out and built a grow room in
[SPEAKER_03]: my space.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would definitely pay for itself in the
long run and it wouldn't eat your freaking
[SPEAKER_03]: Ben & Jerry's.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would get you high as crap in the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: A whole room.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can put multiple depending on the size
of your room.
[SPEAKER_03]: I say every six by six, four by four,
four by four to six by six space,
[SPEAKER_03]: you should put about a thousand watt light
if you can vent it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got a room that's like 10 by 10,
I think you should put 4,000 watt lights
[SPEAKER_03]: in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're getting bigger and bigger,
it kind of depends on your wattage and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff, but about every five by five square
should be a thousand watt light if you can
[SPEAKER_03]: vent that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to leave, people hate walkways.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of growers say that walkways are
expensive and a waste of space.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like giving myself a walkway so I can
get to every single plant and I think the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants like the space to breathe.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't like being crowded in on the bus
with everybody touching you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your plants don't like that shit either.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give them some room to breathe and keeping
the leaves off of each other will prevent
[SPEAKER_03]: powdery mildew and places for bugs to jump
around.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got a whole room, put up 1,000
watt light every five by five space up to
[SPEAKER_03]: the limit that your electricity will allow
and that you can cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a random recommendation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's about 3,000 BTUs of cooling
for every single thousand watt light is
[SPEAKER_03]: what I think you should do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep that in mind and you have to power
that air conditioner also.
[SPEAKER_03]: In your big room here, if you've got your
two 30 amp breakers, you're going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to run one, maybe two lights and an
air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be about it on a 30 amp
breaker.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to need an electrician to
come wire up your big room.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to be able to get the air
conditioner on that most likely.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got a big garage or a basement,
you need to have the electrician come and
[SPEAKER_03]: wire you up with 240 in the whole
basement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you need to have a mini split put in
the basement and hang 24 lights down there
[SPEAKER_03]: in your basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to have an HVAC guy come set that
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: That mini split is going to be fun to put
in, but you can keep it so cool once you
[SPEAKER_03]: get it there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then the next step up from there,
after you have your basement or your big
[SPEAKER_03]: garage with multiple thousands,
anything more than nine lights I think
[SPEAKER_03]: becomes like kind of extensive for a home
grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you got like 10 lights in a house,
you're kind of pushing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you move on to the commercial scale
warehouses where you've got multiple rooms
[SPEAKER_03]: with multiple thousand watt lights or one
giant room with a hundred lights in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of prefer more separated rooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to breed and if something goes
wrong in one room, you don't have it
[SPEAKER_03]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little more containable.
[SPEAKER_03]: My main point is plan the room before you
start building.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about how many lights you want to
run.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about how much cannabis you want to
produce.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about your electrical limitations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about your budget.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to cost you, we said about a
hundred bucks a month to run a light and
[SPEAKER_03]: its accessories.
[SPEAKER_03]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Until Harvest, you're going to have to
figure out how to pay for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once Harvest comes, then you obviously
have a way to pay for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be at an hour real quick
here, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a good way to make this a two-part
episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: The part we're going to come up with next
is actually the basic steps to building
[SPEAKER_03]: the room and some guidance on building a
room and things to look for.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to cut this episode off right
