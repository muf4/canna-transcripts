[SPEAKER_00]: company if you need new seeds for your
garden I highly recommend the hella dank
[SPEAKER_00]: seed company and you can find them at dank
seed dot store you guys know I like to
[SPEAKER_00]: start the show off by letting you know
what I'm smoking today I tried to kill our
[SPEAKER_00]: friend white mic with a nice array of dabs
I think we just hit the orange skittle
[SPEAKER_00]: ambrosia from apothecary how you doing
Mike?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still tasting that one how you doing
over there bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: uh feeling the burn feeling the burn you
uh it's nice and cold but you're you're
[SPEAKER_00]: nice and sweaty over there bro yeah that
last dab's got me cooking yeah it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: uh probably 30 degrees outside and I am
sweaty too I took a dab of this orange
[SPEAKER_00]: skittles ambrosia and my body temperature
just went up super fast I felt it start in
[SPEAKER_00]: like my toes my feet got sweaty and then
my armpits got sweaty and then my forehead
[SPEAKER_00]: got a little sweaty uh Mike just keeps
saying yep and nodding his head I think we
[SPEAKER_00]: tried to give Mike a collapse song you can
go ahead and cough into the mic bro that's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of part of the vibe of the show you
can cough on this one you guys this is not
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be a grow lesson let me put you
back welcome to the show everybody Mike's
[SPEAKER_00]: back I think Mike is coming out of his dab
coma there you guys this is not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be one of the grow lessons that we do we
are going to talk about Canada this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode will come out either the day or
the day after Canada enters the world of
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization welcome to the club Canada in
some ways bro they kind of did it better
[SPEAKER_00]: than us they're definitely going bigger
they're going bigger that is for sure some
[SPEAKER_00]: of their rules are better some of their
laws are better some of their
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunities are better well they had a
lot of other people blaze the trail for
[SPEAKER_02]: them true true there were several
delegations that came to Colorado over the
[SPEAKER_02]: years leading up to this looking at
different rules we had implemented other
[SPEAKER_02]: states that implemented and seeing how
they played out in practice before they
[SPEAKER_00]: went ahead with their law I think they're
doing it right most of what they're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: makes sense to me let's talk more about
what we've been dabbing on bro we uh we
[SPEAKER_02]: went kind of quickly over that we did sort
of that was a tease folks we've still got
[SPEAKER_00]: a pile of hash to talk about uh so we
started off with some I think we started
[SPEAKER_00]: with my lips are sticking together so I
took some of the uh so good I'll talk into
[SPEAKER_00]: the microphone I took some of the fatso
batter that I talked about that garlic
[SPEAKER_00]: scented one and I dunked that into the
stardog terpenes that gave me a head punch
[SPEAKER_02]: that was intense that was my first dab in
like a week and a half well welcome back
[SPEAKER_00]: that that's how we started the day then we
followed that up with the mochi gelato
[SPEAKER_02]: another apothecary farms product the smell
coming off that one just out of the jar is
[SPEAKER_00]: something that speaks to my soul I
described it much differently than Mike
[SPEAKER_00]: did I kind of said that it smelled like
the aroma of Girl Scout cookies plus like
[SPEAKER_00]: a toasted marshmallow sort of aroma Mike
had a much more unique description I
[SPEAKER_02]: thought it was uh it reminds me of if
you've ever had to like change the string
[SPEAKER_02]: on your weed wacker like the head of your
weed wacker that oil and green plant kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of smell mixed together but not real fuely
that just doesn't sound pleasant to me and
[SPEAKER_02]: that it's an odd odor but it's really
pleasant and hash I don't know all right I
[SPEAKER_00]: really liked it as long as you like it or
I guess as long as you have some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion I guess shit do what you like the
hash has been delicious today and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: followed that up with the orange skittles
ambrosia skittles with a Z the this one
[SPEAKER_00]: when they showed me the jar I was like can
I have them in that and he's like do you
[SPEAKER_00]: want this jar and I was like I want that
jar it just coats your teeth oh yeah like
[SPEAKER_02]: my teeth and lips are just sticky from it
it makes your lips sticky it makes your
[SPEAKER_00]: teeth sticky but I think it tastes so I
talk about the clementine a lot the
[SPEAKER_00]: clementine got a sweet sugary orange kind
of a thing this is just straight oranges
[SPEAKER_00]: not the sweet part this is just the
straight citrusy punch where are you going
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike okay fucking cooked I just you're
holding the jar and you're talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: it and I just want to smell it but I
leaned in and tried to sniff the mic I saw
[SPEAKER_02]: you do something I'm glad the cover is
going on but yeah my baked ass just tried
[SPEAKER_02]: to get the center that hash off the
microphone well it's loud enough to where
[SPEAKER_00]: you just might do it but you might want to
check the headphones is where it's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: come through here man take a smell of it
yeah pass that over here that is the
[SPEAKER_02]: orange skittles you also see this jar it's
just like a pile of crystals that's a four
[SPEAKER_00]: gram jar and it is it looks like the it's
not the color but it's the size of the row
[SPEAKER_00]: on the top of some sushi is what it looks
like it has got that nice shiny texture
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's about the same size of some eggs
you'd see on top of sushi maybe a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit bigger than that and I probably just
ruined a bunch of people's appetite by
[SPEAKER_00]: comparing it to the stuff on top of sushi
but that's it's beautiful I think it I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: really glad I went up there for that it
was of course apothecary ambrosia days at
[SPEAKER_00]: apothecary I had to go up there and
participate so those are my grabs the
[SPEAKER_00]: orange skittles the mochi gelato and the
star dog ambrosia of course star dogs
[SPEAKER_00]: always one of my favorites it's a great
strain it's a four gram jar and it is just
[SPEAKER_00]: two giant crystals and a little bit of
sauce in there I prefer there's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more sauce in there than I would prefer so
I've been dunking other dabs into it it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really accenting using those turps yeah
it's really nice it's a really nice little
[SPEAKER_00]: accent for other things I think the turps
give it a little bit of a turbo boost all
[SPEAKER_00]: right so we went from not talking about
what we were smoking to way talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're smoking let's uh let's talk
about Canada Oh Canada all right before we
[SPEAKER_00]: get into the Canada stuff Mike told me a
really funny story as we were setting up
[SPEAKER_00]: today let's talk about this poor dude in
Canada that tried to hold an anti-cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: rally so listeners of the show will know
that I follow the anti-cannabis community
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty closely and yet this popped across
my screen this week it was another
[SPEAKER_02]: anti-cannabis page like lamenting that
this is the way of things and this dude up
[SPEAKER_02]: in Canada is just really really teed off
about legalization and he was gonna host
[SPEAKER_02]: an anti-cannabis march on the 17th
Wednesday is sort of a counter show of
[SPEAKER_02]: force to the legalization of in Canada and
he's canceling his event because of a lack
[SPEAKER_02]: of interest nobody wanted to come support
his nobody is interested that's awesome
[SPEAKER_02]: and I just had to chuckle they've uh the
anti-cannabis community spent a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: time over the last maybe four years of
really trying to make it seem like there's
[SPEAKER_02]: this growing just wave of people who have
had enough with legalization and are
[SPEAKER_02]: coming out to fight it and it's really
just like 14 people that each run three
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook pages and then Kevin Sabat and
like the five guys he pays that's it
[SPEAKER_02]: they're just hate typing all day long just
now and it just seems like there's a bunch
[SPEAKER_02]: of groups out there when there's really
like a handful of people so if not nobody
[SPEAKER_02]: but those 14 folks showed up to protest in
Canada well know that yeah those 14 folks
[SPEAKER_02]: are spread out all over the US and none of
them felt like traveling to Canada to help
[SPEAKER_02]: with this protest so the dude got no
interest that's awesome and sorry dude put
[SPEAKER_02]: a thing up saying the events canceled no
one's interested you guys suck it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: shame no one else is isn't fired up about
legalization and how it's gonna destroy
[SPEAKER_00]: the country people are fired up about
legalization but I think they're on the
[SPEAKER_02]: other side I think they're there that's
I've been fighting the urge to do a post
[SPEAKER_02]: on my page about this because I'm waiting
for the the shots of the crowds of people
[SPEAKER_02]: that come out to celebrate tomorrow yeah
do I've been thinking about January 1st 14
[SPEAKER_00]: about that as I was cooking my breakfast I
was like candidate gets to do that
[SPEAKER_02]: tomorrow that's gonna be pretty cool I
realized that my receipt from the first
[SPEAKER_02]: day of legalization is still packed and
was like fuck I need to get that box out I
[SPEAKER_00]: really need to do that now I haven't
talked about this a lot but because I was
[SPEAKER_00]: the first person to buy recreational
cannabis in Pueblo Colorado when cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: became legal here recreationally and I
still have the two bags of weed that I
[SPEAKER_00]: bought I still have them you still have
the herb yep I still have them in the
[SPEAKER_00]: original packaging I may have the receipt
stapled to one of the bags or next to it
[SPEAKER_02]: they're near each other when I got home
and it settled in like how much I fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: paid for that 8th I was like I have to
smoke this shit it's the most expensive
[SPEAKER_00]: weed I've ever paid for I realized I
bought I bought weed on camera I was on
[SPEAKER_00]: the news buying weed they showed me buy
the weed and pay for it on the news and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I shook the guy's hand and then they
hit cut and then we walked outside and
[SPEAKER_00]: they interviewed me outside and I said my
name and they put my name on the screen I
[SPEAKER_00]: was like I just bought weed from a guy on
TV put my full name out there but I was
[SPEAKER_00]: the first person to buy recreational
cannabis in Colorado so people get to
[SPEAKER_00]: experience that all over the place
tomorrow people be the first one in their
[SPEAKER_00]: their nation and their I'm not sure how
they break it down what are they in
[SPEAKER_00]: provinces yeah I think that's the word I'm
looking for in Canada you to be the first
[SPEAKER_00]: person in your province and then you're
even smaller and then even smaller you
[SPEAKER_00]: know what I mean you get more
opportunities to be the first person in
[SPEAKER_02]: your whatever at least in your dispensary
when Canada's gonna have kind of a unique
[SPEAKER_02]: go of it no one's legalized like they're
about to and so a lot of what we're gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: go over is their first attempt at doing
this right and then the people involved
[SPEAKER_02]: know that there are a lot of rule changes
coming over the next year or three so
[SPEAKER_00]: these are not final yeah and actually a
lot of the articles I read say that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're pushing to change the rules they
just needed to get some rules in place to
[SPEAKER_02]: be on time yeah on Wednesday the rule will
be this but in the next year or two we
[SPEAKER_00]: expected to change to this so we keep
saying tomorrow or yesterday this episode
[SPEAKER_00]: will either come out on Wednesday or
Thursday I have not decided when I will
[SPEAKER_00]: put this out it depends on how the rest of
my evening and recording progress goes I
[SPEAKER_00]: may record another show that's not
relevant but what we are talking about is
[SPEAKER_00]: October 17 2018 Canada will legalize adult
use cannabis it will be mostly legalized
[SPEAKER_00]: some municipalities like in the state in
Colorado will be able to ban the use and
[SPEAKER_00]: sales but for the most part it is legal
one of the coolest parts is and I'm kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of skipping ahead let's just stick to my
notes here I'm excited about one party
[SPEAKER_00]: keeps getting my attention they will allow
flowers they will allow dried and cured
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers you'll be able to use topicals and
it said oils will be available but
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates are not available yet and
edibles are not available yet they have a
[SPEAKER_00]: year to figure that out so you can get
your topicals you can get your flowers but
[SPEAKER_00]: no no dabs yet I know edibles yet but
they're in the works of that they said
[SPEAKER_00]: about a year it's available in
dispensaries there will be dispensaries
[SPEAKER_02]: available well depending on where you live
in Canada there's been dispensaries for a
[SPEAKER_02]: while under either the medical program or
there's a system of illegal dispensaries
[SPEAKER_02]: that operate like every other dispensary
storefront but no licensure or any of that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff there's a comedy club that has one
of those gray area dispensaries above it
[SPEAKER_00]: and they allow you to smoke in the comedy
club so you go up and buy your herb and
[SPEAKER_02]: you go down and smoke and watch a comedy
show I'm gonna have to visit Canada soon
[SPEAKER_00]: yes yes so another thing that really
impresses me is the ongoing online
[SPEAKER_00]: ordering and delivery of cannabis you can
order online and have your stuff delivered
[SPEAKER_02]: in some places that'll be the only legal
outlet it's gonna be coming through the
[SPEAKER_00]: mail the 17th it's completely legal to
order your herb through the mail to send
[SPEAKER_00]: your friend stuff through the mail in
Canada that is so neat to me I like that
[SPEAKER_00]: so the California guys could just be
growing some of that California stuff be
[SPEAKER_00]: like Ross and Jeff you want to try some of
these flowers I grew and just send me a
[SPEAKER_00]: pound of it and I could try it then I
could send them out a pound of whatever I
[SPEAKER_02]: grew and then we could try each other's
stuff legal means legal and Canada's going
[SPEAKER_00]: legal they're doing it right that's one of
the things I really like is the the mail
[SPEAKER_00]: and online stuff that they're doing also
it's going to be affordable you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: like the price of cannabis and then we'll
talk about how much it costs here cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: will be about seven dollars a gram in
Canada in Canadian dollars and that is
[SPEAKER_00]: five US dollars so five dollars a gram
it's not from what I've seen and heard and
[SPEAKER_00]: read I've got friends in Canada and I do
some work with a couple of companies in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada it's not the quality of what we've
got here but it's close and I'm sure there
[SPEAKER_00]: are some places that are getting close to
what some of our places are doing you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't say that there are no good growers
in a place that always sounds stupid when
[SPEAKER_02]: you do that it cracks me up how that's
swung back and forth over the last 20
[SPEAKER_02]: years oh yeah Canada was way better than
the US a growing herb up until the point
[SPEAKER_02]: mid legalization years where the US stole
the show and now Canada's working for a
[SPEAKER_00]: comeback they may just do it they just may
do it so it's affordable it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: affordable here in Colorado right now it's
about ten bucks a gram you can find eight
[SPEAKER_00]: dollar grams you can also find seventeen
dollar grams depending on where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: shopping and what what quality you're
looking for or how much advertising a
[SPEAKER_00]: place is done it's not always about the
quality unfortunately sometimes the more
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive but is not the best quality
that's not always the case some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: shops in Denver the places I recommend
they've got closer to fifteen dollar grams
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's worth it I think it's the stuff
you're really looking for right that
[SPEAKER_00]: photogenic frosty looking shit so it's
affordable the ages they did it a little
[SPEAKER_00]: differently they have a little more trust
in Canadian citizens Canada is allowing
[SPEAKER_00]: ages 19 and up to participate in Canada in
cannabis in some places I think it's as
[SPEAKER_00]: low as 18 that's what I've got here in
Quebec you can be 18 so that's pretty cool
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear you got to be 21 I'm pretty sure
the the brackets I saw with the Quebec
[SPEAKER_02]: there there's at least a group in Quebec
looking to push that to 21 here in the
[SPEAKER_02]: next year or two but at the start it'll be
18 that's got to be so frustrating to
[SPEAKER_00]: start off at one age and then see people
going oh next year I could smoke and then
[SPEAKER_02]: they change the rules on them there's yeah
there's definitely a group of people that
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't old enough to enjoy it this week
when it goes legal but will be in a year
[SPEAKER_02]: or two if they don't change that law yeah
it will be it'll be rough for them if they
[SPEAKER_02]: change that law in the middle of there but
an unfortunate they're gonna be the only
[SPEAKER_00]: ones out there voting to keep it that way
because they're the only ones that care so
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a small demographic the Canada's
been explicit about why they have the age
[SPEAKER_02]: set there they're really targeting the
black market in Canada it's been way too
[SPEAKER_02]: prevailing prevailing it for way too long
in there that's a they know that the 18 to
[SPEAKER_02]: 24 year old demographic are the largest
can they're like a third of the marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: consuming population 24 year olds and so
they're targeting that whole bracket with
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization at least in a couple of parts
of the country that's pretty cool that is
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely a good a good idea I agree with
that it makes a lot of sense there that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the black market age that's when that's
when you buy from your black market
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and then that's when people become
black market dealers is that age because
[SPEAKER_00]: they have the black market friends it's
how it kind of how it works they go
[SPEAKER_00]: hand-in-hand all those kids need some guys
got so it works out yeah they're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminate that that's that's pretty cool
possession limits you're allowed to
[SPEAKER_02]: possess 30 grams that's not bad nope not
bad at all that's two and that's just like
[SPEAKER_00]: out that's out in the world it's 1.6 grams
over an ounce I liked that rant the other
[SPEAKER_00]: day by the way yeah thank you I'm glad you
cut my call back there so you can carry an
[SPEAKER_00]: ounce of weed with you which if you're
going out for the night or to the weekend
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever that's plenty of herb right
and if you're going out for the weekend
[SPEAKER_00]: don't take a whole ounce with you just
take a couple of eights with you in one
[SPEAKER_00]: container so that you don't look like
you're selling it take a quarter so they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't go smoke all your weed with
everybody because you'll get you'll have
[SPEAKER_00]: too many drinks and you'll smoke too many
bowls let's smoke another board the the or
[SPEAKER_02]: set it down on the table for the hockey
team is winning come back to just a gram
[SPEAKER_00]: left in your baggie yeah yeah don't take
all your weed up because you'll smoke all
[SPEAKER_00]: your weed that's one thing I learned let's
see you were allowed to smoke where you
[SPEAKER_00]: were allowed to consume cigarettes which
is basically yeah in most places country
[SPEAKER_00]: there are some places that are going to
make their own specific rules on that of
[SPEAKER_00]: course because that's just how some
municipalities go it's how what they like
[SPEAKER_00]: to do some places are uptight you're not
allowed to smoke in city parks or on city
[SPEAKER_00]: beaches but they have said they will allow
you to smoke in their national parks at
[SPEAKER_00]: their campground so it's your campground
around the fire you are allowed to light
[SPEAKER_00]: up here in Colorado you cannot smoke in a
national park so you if you were at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo reservoir whatever reservoir you
were in you cannot take your cannabis with
[SPEAKER_00]: you and if you get caught you were on
federal land with cannabis you could get
[SPEAKER_00]: in trouble honestly most of the park
rangers are pretty cool they're people
[SPEAKER_00]: they're humans too a lot of the time
they're pretty cool like hey bro you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: have that here but there's always that one
guy it wants to like I always talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: that one guy that wants to fuck up
people's day and be a hero so be careful
[SPEAKER_02]: of that guy they're the the US Park
Service is having an issue with funding so
[SPEAKER_02]: they're looking for any anything good to
squeeze an extra buck and the hippie with
[SPEAKER_02]: the stuff he's not supposed to have is
definitely a way to do that yeah you see
[SPEAKER_00]: my dreadlocked ass out there in my hiking
shoes and my backpack yeah you're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: searched they're like let's check this guy
out man yeah so you can have your stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: there when you're camping you can't have
that stuff in Colorado in a national park
[SPEAKER_02]: is what I'm saying just to be clear that's
the beauty of national legalization is
[SPEAKER_02]: there's no difference between like state
and federal there's little rule policy
[SPEAKER_02]: changes but it's not like it's illegal on
this side of the line so far the rules say
[SPEAKER_00]: for home grows you can grow four plants
four plants per home not per person or per
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it's per house is what I read so
far from what I understand you can have
[SPEAKER_00]: four plants landlords can ban you from
growing that's up to the landlord so
[SPEAKER_00]: municipalities are going to ban that also
of course that's a couple already have I
[SPEAKER_00]: believe yes yes some places that have a
lot of dispensary presence have been that
[SPEAKER_00]: which I see is kind of a capitalizing
monopoly sort of a thing but well
[SPEAKER_02]: different parts of Canada have had major
home growth issues for decades I reshared
[SPEAKER_02]: the Union recently on my my cannabis page
because a big chunk of that is like early
[SPEAKER_00]: 2000s black market Canada production when
you said Canada and black market I paused
[SPEAKER_00]: because I went do I want to go that route
and start talking about the Union so it
[SPEAKER_02]: looks like we are well it's it's if you
haven't seen it it's a beautiful
[SPEAKER_02]: documentary that gives you a nice little
snapshot of the black market in Canada and
[SPEAKER_02]: like the early 2000s and it's that
experience that has the country where they
[SPEAKER_00]: are now how come the part that stands out
most of them the most from that movie to
[SPEAKER_00]: me is when they had a power outage for
several days and the guys are showing
[SPEAKER_00]: their grows they're like I don't know we I
haven't had power for like four days and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're still going I hope everything
comes out already different documentary
[SPEAKER_00]: watching these guys is that a different
documentary I was watching these Canadian
[SPEAKER_00]: growers freak out seven had power for so
many days and they're talking about their
[SPEAKER_00]: grows how important it is that it comes
through because they put all this money
[SPEAKER_00]: into it and they're like so far in I
understand that feeling like but I was
[SPEAKER_00]: just like oh man they've had they had like
four feet of snow outside they hadn't had
[SPEAKER_00]: power for days and I was like that crop
dude is so close to being done they were
[SPEAKER_00]: shining flashlights on it and shit just to
keep it alive it's like it just needs a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of light every day it'll be
alrighty like oh what documentary is that
[SPEAKER_02]: what movie is that I can't remember off
the name of my head or off the top of my
[SPEAKER_00]: head but I've seen it somebody out there
is watching send me a tweet it's at GF YH
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast let me know what movie my brain is
is trying to remember I've got a traumatic
[SPEAKER_00]: brain injury so it's in there it's just
not labeled accurately anymore the
[SPEAKER_00]: contents fell out of the folder and now
I'm just reading a file then I'm like yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: here's a part about a movie the one thing
that is gonna drive people nuts about
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada's legalization is the little
nuanced rules like I know there are a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of people that are annoyed that
concentrates and edibles they're holding
[SPEAKER_02]: off for a year and that's largely because
of the anti cannabis groups too big
[SPEAKER_02]: talking points that have taken hold or
that edibles are scary and bad for kids
[SPEAKER_02]: and concentrates are super potent and
we've never had anything this potent
[SPEAKER_02]: before it's up to 99% THC now they rant
about all the time it's total fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: nonsense the THC pill that's been legal
since the 70s is 100% THC I wish I could
[SPEAKER_00]: just explain to these people I wish I
could explain to them that if you give me
[SPEAKER_00]: a concentrate that is 50% THC and a
concentrate that's a hundred percent THC
[SPEAKER_00]: probably gonna take two dabs of the
hundred and four dabs of the fifty I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna get the same high I'm just gonna
consume less dabs of the other one the
[SPEAKER_02]: only thing the anti cannabis community
understands about concentrates is that
[SPEAKER_02]: they look scary and the numbers sound
scary they love talking about the
[SPEAKER_02]: blowtorch but they always fuck it up they
go this stuff's it's it's not weed it's
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't have to light weed with a
blowtorch they right they think that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: setting the hash on fire with the
blowtorch yeah they don't at all
[SPEAKER_02]: understand that we're heating a surface to
vaporize a concentrate and that it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: a complicated tool involved way of hitting
a vape pen the hippie rant in me is like
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't want you to understand that man
that makes it acceptable man if they took
[SPEAKER_00]: a moment to explain it and they're like
man so what we're doing is vaporizing now
[SPEAKER_00]: the newscaster never does that they go
then they heat the hash with a blowtorch
[SPEAKER_00]: and smoke it like a crack rock just
because that sells more gets more clicks
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't sound like the simple
explanation doesn't get any attention you
[SPEAKER_02]: got to create fear there's only one or two
of them that are capable of higher level
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking of that nature the rest of them
it's just seriously you'll if you follow
[SPEAKER_02]: these people for more than a week or two
you start watching them get confused by
[SPEAKER_02]: shit that like everybody should know like
one of them tried to hand out her own
[SPEAKER_02]: printout literature outside of the
cannabis conference they do every year
[SPEAKER_02]: here at PCC and she couldn't understand
why there was a process she had to go
[SPEAKER_02]: through before she handed out literature
on campus oh yeah it's a campus lady yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: it's and she's like well I went here like
four years ago and the person she's
[SPEAKER_02]: talking to in the videos why the fuck
don't you understand what I'm saying yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah you claim to have attended here and
graduated from here but you don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: basic rules about this space is like first
of all you don't go here you need to leave
[SPEAKER_00]: you didn't pay money to be here you buy
lady you know you don't have a permit to
[SPEAKER_00]: put out approved pamphlets no you can't be
here no I get it what if she's passing out
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of like come join our cult and
you're passing it out on that campus now
[SPEAKER_02]: that campus could be liable for that coal
most of those rules exist because fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: white supremacists used to do it all the
time yeah I wasn't gonna pick a group I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't want to give anybody any shoutouts
that's why I said cult they fucked it up
[SPEAKER_02]: for everybody now everybody's got to
submit their form two weeks in advance and
[SPEAKER_02]: have two heads of whatever stamp it like
they fucked it up for everybody makes
[SPEAKER_00]: sense though I don't want you come and
stand in my front yard and passing out
[SPEAKER_00]: your white power pamphlets it's totally
not what I support right come out there
[SPEAKER_00]: and have a barbecue okay wait a minute bro
oh there's like seven side rants I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: trying not to go on right now yeah we got
cool we've no we got really far into this
[SPEAKER_00]: before the rants happen Tim Hortons by
stocking Tim Horton let's get some poutine
[SPEAKER_00]: a I've got a lot of friends out in Canada
so big shout out to all them thanks for
[SPEAKER_02]: thanks for letting me make fun of you guys
if you're in Canada listening to this
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoy this moment one of the coolest
things in Colorado was watching how little
[SPEAKER_02]: things change after legalization like you
don't see people buying weed in the park
[SPEAKER_02]: as often true the glass that you see in
head shops changes rapidly oh yeah the
[SPEAKER_02]: products on the market evolved very very
quickly I remember them when there was
[SPEAKER_02]: like one company doing hash like we've got
on the table and now there's like 40 oh
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah and it's only been months these six
eight months so quickly remember years ago
[SPEAKER_02]: we thought clear shatter was the most
amazing shit yep when that dude holding
[SPEAKER_02]: the ice puck from the hood of his car was
the most famous dude on Instagram yeah but
[SPEAKER_02]: like clothing the different parts of the
community like places where like the
[SPEAKER_02]: Comedy Club where you can go and enjoy
cannabis right you will see other little
[SPEAKER_02]: places like that pop up and there's
several technically is not legal by the
[SPEAKER_00]: way let me mention that kind of
technically that is not legal at this time
[SPEAKER_02]: the ones that are up and running now the
smart ones are already lobbying local
[SPEAKER_02]: government to hey there's a need for this
we have a customer base that loves us
[SPEAKER_02]: there's clearly a need for this in our
community license it regulate it tell us
[SPEAKER_02]: where to be tell us when we can be open
tell us how loud we can be tell us what
[SPEAKER_02]: other stuff we can do there and we're down
I can't help but think there was just a
[SPEAKER_02]: bar that got in trouble for axe throwing
oh yeah I saw that where they the local
[SPEAKER_02]: people regulators from some segment that
covers the bar industry showed up and they
[SPEAKER_02]: had like dudes and flip-flops throwing
axes at liquor bottles I don't think it
[SPEAKER_02]: was at liquor bottles but that was one of
the violations is they were fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: throwing them empty liquor bottles awesome
and they're like you can't have broken
[SPEAKER_02]: glass and flip-flops and flying fucking
axes at the same time with drums what part
[SPEAKER_02]: of Florida was this I don't even remember
but I mean when you've got that in the
[SPEAKER_02]: world and you're just talking about like I
want to do like good coffee some
[SPEAKER_02]: cheesecakes and weed with some booths and
maybe some soft music like why is that so
[SPEAKER_02]: hard to figure out rules for the children
Mike I almost said something I probably
[SPEAKER_02]: would have laughed out later but you got
kids now well like if we can do guns and
[SPEAKER_02]: we can do fucking prescription drugs and
we can do cars and we can do fucking air
[SPEAKER_02]: travel we can figure out how to sell weed
yeah bro next to each other the dangerous
[SPEAKER_02]: list doesn't include weed like lawn
equipment tide pods fucking snowblowers
[SPEAKER_02]: quicksand dry just driving is like the
most dangerous activity humans engage in
[SPEAKER_02]: regularly and we don't have any sort of
awareness of that and then you see people
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about consumption spaces or
cannabis cafes looking some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: articles I was reading about Canada if you
don't own your own property like you're
[SPEAKER_02]: not a homeowner you rent an apartment
depending on the part of Canada you're in
[SPEAKER_02]: and your landlord's preference there may
be no legal space anywhere within miles
[SPEAKER_02]: and miles of you for you to consume
cannabis yep and so you're just like a
[SPEAKER_02]: tourist in Denver with a hotel that says
no smoking there's no legal place for you
[SPEAKER_00]: to consume it's like you can see through
the computer and you can see my notes
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's my next bullet point that
was pretty good but when you sit down and
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about regulating these kinds of
spaces people bring up the craziest shit
[SPEAKER_02]: and I feel like such an asshole when I'm
like but everywhere in the civilized world
[SPEAKER_02]: already has an infrastructure in place for
adults to leave their home or place of
[SPEAKER_02]: residence go to an outside location a
secondary location where they don't live
[SPEAKER_02]: get very intoxicated and then return home
safely yeah and we've designed this system
[SPEAKER_02]: in every part of America every part of
Canada all over Europe to get people from
[SPEAKER_02]: their house to the bar and back again in
one piece and because we're talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis people are like well how they
gonna get home yep and it's like well
[SPEAKER_02]: because Uber's still a thing and like you
can be high and work that app it would
[SPEAKER_00]: increase commerce you're gonna go to a
place the for what so you go to let's say
[SPEAKER_00]: let's create Mike and Jeff's little
fucking chill and smoke lounge in the
[SPEAKER_00]: living room that's the name that's the
official name of our business Mike and
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff's little chill and smoke lounge over
there in the living room I like it it's
[SPEAKER_00]: two couches and cheesecake yeah coffee and
cheesecake I want um coffee cake with
[SPEAKER_00]: little crumbly stuff on top yeah maybe a
muffin or something we got some stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that available that's what I want in there
maybe so we do the whole muffin or just
[SPEAKER_02]: the top or am I getting too detailed can
we can you just order muffin tops that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a fucking thing dude bro we're
fucked the muffin bottoms those yeah you
[SPEAKER_00]: can send those to third world countries
where they belong those are beer drinkers
[SPEAKER_00]: we just saw the tops here all right let's
get back on track here so I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: put myself on track I got pretty high so
we've got a smoke lounge people walk in we
[SPEAKER_00]: offer we can't offer concentrates because
it's Canada that's not allowed we offer
[SPEAKER_00]: bong rips or vapes they will say vapes
because clean air it's easier so whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: you pay a cover to get in or whatever you
pay a membership you come in you take a
[SPEAKER_00]: vape what's the next thing you do need a
drink bro now you're gonna drink in a
[SPEAKER_00]: snack if we offer you a good drink and a
good snack you're gonna spend a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more money which we're gonna put back in
with taxes which goes back into the
[SPEAKER_00]: community now at the end of the day you'd
be like well now I got to get myself from
[SPEAKER_00]: here over to the Tim Hortons to go meet up
with Timmy and Miss Cannabis and Full
[SPEAKER_00]: Monty and all my other Canadian friends
and I got to get in an uber if there was a
[SPEAKER_02]: place that had good food and drinks in our
area that allowed us to consume cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: there we don't record at least half of
these shows I was gonna say I'd record
[SPEAKER_00]: there and we'd have more people meet us
there and it would be like a thing people
[SPEAKER_00]: would flow people would come and go onto
the podcast other cannabis consumers would
[SPEAKER_00]: be like hey can I have a seat here on the
show I'm like yeah bro sit on it it'd be
[SPEAKER_02]: oh my god it'd be so great but when you
talk about this stuff especially here in
[SPEAKER_02]: the states you have to overcome several
fucking hurdles that are just
[SPEAKER_02]: insurmountable it seems like and one of
them is half the population pretends like
[SPEAKER_02]: we don't have a way to you know go out get
drunk and get home in one piece like they
[SPEAKER_02]: just you you run into all this nonsense
about how everybody just enjoys the flavor
[SPEAKER_02]: of alcoholic beverage it's like well we'll
just have one glass with dinner like
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the social consumption norm and
it's like well then why the fuck do they
[SPEAKER_02]: have it at little league soccer games
there's literally booze everywhere we
[SPEAKER_02]: can't just have like three or four places
around the city to go and I'm maybe bowl
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe watch a movie or see you would be
way more likely to get me to go bowling if
[SPEAKER_00]: I could go bowling for bong hits if I
could go roll a strike and every time I
[SPEAKER_00]: got a strike I want to dab I would shoot
260 I would be a I would be a sharpshooter
[SPEAKER_00]: bro you wouldn't want to fuck with me at
the bowling alley I've got bowling
[SPEAKER_02]: experience if they just set it aside at
night and they were like Wednesday nights
[SPEAKER_02]: is it's cannabis consumption night you
have to be over the legal age in this area
[SPEAKER_02]: to come in you're getting ID'd hard at the
door bring your owner knock yourself out
[SPEAKER_02]: like I'd go at least twice a month hell
yeah bro yeah what else could we do what
[SPEAKER_00]: what would other be the movie theater if I
could just take a dab in the middle
[SPEAKER_00]: there's always that point about 45 to an
hour in a movie you probably start going I
[SPEAKER_00]: could use a cigarette yep that's when my
brain goes hey you gonna take a dab or
[SPEAKER_00]: what dude like if I could just walk up to
the little it's got to be silent you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: hear the torch in there fucking 22 dudes
watching days and confused with the torch
[SPEAKER_00]: going no but if I could walk up to a
little email station and just take a and
[SPEAKER_00]: then go back to my seat a bride be way
more likely to go watch a movie if Walmart
[SPEAKER_00]: had a dab station no let's not say Walmart
people don't want us to shop at Walmart if
[SPEAKER_00]: my local family owned and operated
organically locally sourced gluten-free
[SPEAKER_00]: vegan I'm gonna say the butcher yeah right
I'm just trying to be silly and socially
[SPEAKER_02]: conscious at the same time but there's a
dozen different businesses that would
[SPEAKER_02]: increase their customer flow if the
skating rink was allowed at some segment
[SPEAKER_02]: there was a restaurant up in Denver that
wanted to do they're gonna do the second
[SPEAKER_02]: story they had a second story seating area
that was just overflow and they were just
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna permanently mark it off as the
cannabis section and people freaked the
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck out we had a friend throw a birthday
party at probably that restaurant because
[SPEAKER_00]: they had an upstairs section that was an
overflow and when I walked in they were
[SPEAKER_00]: open for a while before they got there
were rigs and it was all of our stuff we
[SPEAKER_00]: brought everybody brought a rig and a
torch and there were rigs so fancy dinner
[SPEAKER_00]: plates and wine glasses and wine bottles
and bread and dads and we were between
[SPEAKER_00]: each course you know we'd be like hey have
you tried this concentrate we take a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple dabs with each other we dabbed out
the wait staff we dabbed out the cook they
[SPEAKER_00]: all came back and they're like you guys
partying up here and like yeah it's her
[SPEAKER_00]: birthday and they're like cool take dabs
and we and it was a great time they had a
[SPEAKER_00]: good time with us we got them stoned and
when I'm stoned and I cook my food just
[SPEAKER_00]: tastes I don't know if it's cuz I'm stoner
I'm eating it or if it's cuz I was stoned
[SPEAKER_00]: and I cooked it and I just did something
magical it's like I can make a hell of a
[SPEAKER_00]: grilled cheese sandwich and I can watch my
mom make we can my mom and I could get the
[SPEAKER_00]: same exact pan the same bread same butter
same cheese same everything and her
[SPEAKER_00]: grilled cheese sandwich is just gonna
taste a little bit fucking better than
[SPEAKER_00]: mine I don't know what she does it just
comes out it's cuz my mama made it and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just that little sprinkle it's like
that's what it's like when I get stoned
[SPEAKER_00]: and make my food it's like putting mama
magic in it's that little extra touch so
[SPEAKER_00]: you get stoned with the wait staff and
they go down there and they make a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: stoned ass meal and then you're getting
stoned and eating too and there's nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong with it there's no problem and then
you're eating so you're not lit when you
[SPEAKER_00]: leave you hang out you have and what about
the other people that are drinking wine
[SPEAKER_02]: downstairs what's the difference we used
to go to in college there was a place
[SPEAKER_02]: where I can't remember the price but it
was a lot it was like for 60 or 70 bucks
[SPEAKER_02]: you'd sit down and you get like nine
different types of whiskey like I never
[SPEAKER_02]: ordered that nine but they were it was all
little sample sizes but still and they had
[SPEAKER_02]: like a little map and it was like this
one's from here and this one's from here
[SPEAKER_02]: and this one's from here and like the
thing I liked there was their burger but a
[SPEAKER_02]: number of my friends were really into that
fucking expensive booze thing and if they
[SPEAKER_02]: can have that like are we really asking
that much and honestly I think Canada's
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna get their way fucked before we do
Canada's got it right Canada has got
[SPEAKER_02]: they've got some ugly hurdles they're
gonna have to go over the next few years
[SPEAKER_00]: for sure yeah but they're on the way on
the business business path they're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: it right on the consumption path I think
they're gonna do it right they're gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: have import and export with other
countries only for two very specific it's
[SPEAKER_02]: not recreational import export it's for
medical research and for something else
[SPEAKER_02]: okay but they're starting with import
export everybody else is on lockdown the
[SPEAKER_02]: the one or two rules that I see that
they're really gonna end up fighting over
[SPEAKER_02]: our consumption spaces and the age limit I
think the the edibles in concentrates
[SPEAKER_02]: they're just gonna end up hammering out
packaging rules like we did here oh yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: that'll take two years they say one year
but they'll get on it in about six months
[SPEAKER_00]: and they'll make it happen a year and a
half after that and they're their biggest
[SPEAKER_02]: hurdles probably gonna be the existing
market they've got a multi-tiered black
[SPEAKER_02]: market gray market white market system in
place already and a lot of that's locked
[SPEAKER_02]: out of the legal industry they're looking
to create now my favorite thing I learned
[SPEAKER_00]: from this episode was the idea of allowing
19 and 18 year old citizens to purchase
[SPEAKER_00]: and possess cannabis to further eradicate
the black market I think that's a really
[SPEAKER_00]: good strategy when you explained to me why
way I kind of dawned on me as you started
[SPEAKER_00]: saying was like oh man because that's when
I was buying and selling the most black
[SPEAKER_00]: market cannabis was between the ages of
probably I shouldn't admit like 17 to 24
[SPEAKER_00]: ish was when I was really banging out the
black market product so yeah that's you
[SPEAKER_00]: could probably change people's lives you
keep people out of trouble and keep people
[SPEAKER_00]: from taking that path and also falling
into trouble because their friend took
[SPEAKER_02]: that path and they bought it from them the
real destruction that kind of flows out
[SPEAKER_02]: from the black market is the market part
it's the amount of employees threats
[SPEAKER_02]: secrets shenanigans it takes to produce
and distribute billions and billions of
[SPEAKER_02]: dollars with the cannabis is just fucking
nuts and if you look at the size of the
[SPEAKER_02]: marketplace it's huge and then you start
doing the math and you're like all right
[SPEAKER_02]: so like a big home grows like two million
year divide by 35 billion how many houses
[SPEAKER_02]: that fuck it gets crazy fast and then you
figure about you know how many little
[SPEAKER_02]: dealers and shit all of that market is is
gonna start changing and we watched it
[SPEAKER_02]: here in Colorado where you had ten friends
that all sold herb and kind of worked in a
[SPEAKER_02]: community where when somebody was low they
would buy from the others and when
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody grew a strain that was really
good that other consumers like they'd try
[SPEAKER_02]: to trade and one by one all of those
people sort of dropping out of the game
[SPEAKER_02]: yep and converting into full legal or
leaving to someplace where the black
[SPEAKER_02]: market was still thriving but we
completely eradicated the distribution end
[SPEAKER_00]: of the black market in Colorado yeah they
all got jobs it grows or dispensaries or
[SPEAKER_02]: as trimmers or wherever else you see
people talk about oh all they have to do
[SPEAKER_02]: is on you know just don't charge the taxes
and there's still no fucking profit in it
[SPEAKER_02]: right like you can't make a living with
three lights in a basement and five dollar
[SPEAKER_00]: grams and it's not worth it anymore
there's so much competition yeah there's
[SPEAKER_02]: literally no profit in it you're barely
making what it took to produce back on it
[SPEAKER_02]: and if you're only doing that in an
at-home scale there's literally no fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: money in it you've got to do a hundred
percent of the work yourself there's no
[SPEAKER_02]: wiggle room in your profit margins for
helpers or waterers or trimmers or is
[SPEAKER_00]: miserable so one by one they all drop out
trim all that shit yourself again yep I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't miss those days oh and for a dollar
profit a gram when it was 28 gram all day
[SPEAKER_02]: long to everybody it was worth it oh yeah
but that's all your profit that's gone now
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds went from 4,000 to 35 to 32 they
stayed at 32 for a couple of years and
[SPEAKER_00]: they started getting like 27 and then they
were 25 for quite a while and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: next summer 1500 you were like oh shit my
weeds not worth anything $100 an ounce if
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm lucky and now it was Colorado you can
get a pound of weed for 1200 maybe $900 if
[SPEAKER_00]: you want that low shelf not beautiful
stuff but it's available and a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people time of the year and which market
you're pushing in give it a month from
[SPEAKER_00]: here you're gonna see thousand dollar
pounds all over the place a month we had
[SPEAKER_02]: two nasty cold freezes at the start of
October like people are gonna be early
[SPEAKER_02]: harvesting which means that crop didn't
finish right when you add that into places
[SPEAKER_02]: that have acreage in the legal market when
that hits the rec market the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: industry just holds their breath for four
months until that fucking supplies gone
[SPEAKER_00]: yep you see a lot of hash you see a lot of
different kinds of concentrates but
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada's about to get all of this you guys
are lucky that's fun right now it's such a
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah it's so much fun to watch I'm gonna
try to get this episode out as soon as I
[SPEAKER_00]: can so that Canada can enjoy this on their
day of legalization congratulations Canada

start wrapping up the show I admonish
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody for trying to do a final thought
because only Jerry gets to do that shit if
[SPEAKER_02]: you insist if you're in Canada and don't
dig the rules that are rolling out and
[SPEAKER_02]: your area by all means work to change them

[SPEAKER_02]: several organizations already fighting
this fight in Canada all you have to do is
[SPEAKER_02]: lend your support there are several ways
to do that real easy contact me if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking for specifics and enjoy it it's
this is something that thousands and
[SPEAKER_02]: thousands of people have been fighting for
their whole lives to achieve and Canada's
[SPEAKER_02]: going legal coast to coast and everyone up
there should get to enjoy this and all the
[SPEAKER_02]: anti-pop people ha ha ha the harder you
fight the easier this fight gets I like
