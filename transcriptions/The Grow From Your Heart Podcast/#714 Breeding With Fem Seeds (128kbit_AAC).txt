[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, here we go!
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, ganja farmers!
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 714 of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to talk about
growing feminized seeds and working with
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I get to that part of the show,
let's do a few shots out to a few of those
[SPEAKER_00]: great folks who continue to support the
show on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's kick it off with a big Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you shout out to Danny Dave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a big thank you shout out to
our buddy Bob.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a thank you to Alabama Man and
JG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a big salute and a fist bump
and a thank you shout out to the captain
[SPEAKER_00]: and commander of the Irish Army,
my friend Lemur Priest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a big thank you shout out to
Billy Podunk holding it down in Alaska.

buddy OG Purple Thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a special thank you shout
out to my buddy Gaiute Gros.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send a thank you to BlackHawksFan
and Matt H.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's wrap it all up with a big Grow
From Your Heart podcast thank you shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out to TreeumUp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks and big shout out to everybody
who continues to support the show on
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not already supporting the show
and you would like to learn how to do so,
[SPEAKER_00]: all you have to do is visit www.patreon
.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need will be
right there on the screen and you know I
[SPEAKER_00]: do include a link in the show notes and in
the video description to make everything
[SPEAKER_00]: nice and easy for all of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to make one quick update,
maybe an announcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times when you sign up for
Patreon you type in a name and that is now
[SPEAKER_00]: your Patreon account name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people put their regular name,
some people put their full name,
[SPEAKER_00]: some people make up a cool name and put
Gaiute Gros in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have Lemur Priest in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people however are just putting their
real full government name in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you want me to say your
real legal name on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that that could get you in
some trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe your co-workers, your boss,
your friends, maybe your wife finds out
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're contributing to the Patreon
and she doesn't want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to get in any trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm saying the wrong name or if I
haven't said your name and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned, simply send me a message on
Patreon and let me know what your name is
[SPEAKER_00]: under on the account and let me know what
the corrected name I should say on the
[SPEAKER_00]: show is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have an update from one person here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been possibly saying the wrong name
but they do want me to give a shout out to
[SPEAKER_00]: ohcannabis613.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to ohcannabis613.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure from this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if that was the message was
from ohcannabis or if their friend paid
[SPEAKER_00]: for this shout out honestly by the looks
of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But either way, if I'm not saying the
correct name because I've called a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of people the wrong name for several
episodes, just update me, correct me,
[SPEAKER_00]: send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a cannabis podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means I do consume cannabis before,
after, and possibly during this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have forgotten, if I have failed to
make the adjustments and corrections,
[SPEAKER_00]: simply send me another email, send me a
nudge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get it corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say the right thing on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so once again, big shout out to
our buddy ohcannabis613.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if that came from you or your
friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, big love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the support to both of you or
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a real topic for this podcast
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a screenshot here in my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to grab the phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm not flirting with anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not scrolling Instagram looking at
butts and boobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am actually reading a message here on
the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, I found this on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer not to take the comments from the
YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much easier to capture them and print
them and use them here on the show when
[SPEAKER_00]: they come through either an email or the
Grow Help tab on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that before we even get
to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the website, iregenetics.com,
there is a Grow Help tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a tab that says Grow Help.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have questions or need grow help
with your plants, all you have to do is
[SPEAKER_00]: fill out a quick, it's like a
questionnaire.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like basically asking your blood
pressure, height, and weight, but we do it
[SPEAKER_00]: about the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you indoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing under LED, HPS,
ceramic metal halide?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you using campfire and flashlights?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of soil are you in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you using hydro?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know some questions,
and then I give you an opportunity to type
[SPEAKER_00]: in your question and ask what you need
help with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I ask so many preliminary
questions is because people say,
[SPEAKER_00]: why are my plants yellow?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, that could be a billion
things with that little questionnaire,
[SPEAKER_00]: that little preview, that little survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: That helps me get an idea of what's going
on with your plants in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It answers all the questions I was going
to reply with anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It saves us a step.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got grow questions,
if you need grow help, I do recommend the
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow Help tab on iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That goes straight to the phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you send that message, it goes to my
phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: My phone jingles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will check that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will print it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll end up in paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best way to get it on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got papers piled up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know which episode they go to,
their paper clips together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just my organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I did like this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to read a lot of them from
YouTube, because it's harder to find them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's harder to print them, keep them,
access them, file them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this one was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking high and rambly, but it's
going to work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one goes a little bit a lot,
if not just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, can I do this with feminized
seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they ask a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clone a P1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that basically means grow a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've grown your parent, your P1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to clone the P1,
which was feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've assumed this was feminized,
so they're asking about femme seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clone the P1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use colloidal silver on one clone,
and use that to pollinate multiple plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, yes, you can absolutely do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what is commonly done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take a P1 plant,
and we're going to clone that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to reverse one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to do what I call
pollen chucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to put that pollen on a cut of
the same thing and a cut of other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we've got a breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're off to a good start here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, now I'm going to take another P1
clone and spray that, cross that with the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds from the first batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that should give me F2 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been watching you more and more
lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friend Sean Cross
from the YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's parts of this question that I have
questions about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to clarify that right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you say, then take another P1 clone
and spray that, if that P1, so what you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to do now, if you want to make that
F2, there's a specific step because you
[SPEAKER_00]: could mess this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me try to clarify the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to, of course,
ramble on Rose about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, so you're going to take a plant and it
does not matter if it's feminized or
[SPEAKER_00]: non-feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about that's going to be
the main chunk of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me scroll up and get myself to that
part of the notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about that part a lot
here, but let me get myself back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to take a feminized plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter at this point,
if it's regular or feminized is all the
[SPEAKER_00]: same.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm going to ramble about in a
moment here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to clone it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just like I said, we're going to
reverse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use colloidal silver, whatever
works best for your situation,
[SPEAKER_00]: your experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reverse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chuck some pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're going to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now to make F2, which is the filial second
filial generation, you have to take seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: a batch of those seeds that come from the
same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just say you took a golden goat
and you pollinated lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've now made lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an R1, also technically can be an F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this case, we're going to call it an
F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: To make an F2, you would have to take a
batch of those lemon Jeffrey F1 seeds or
[SPEAKER_00]: S1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or R1 is what it technically, it's an R1
and an F1 at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to take seeds out of that batch
and you're going to have to reverse that
[SPEAKER_00]: and then make that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the same male and female out of that
batch, because that's how you make the
[SPEAKER_00]: filial generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go back and use one of the males or
females from previous, notice I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they came from the same batch of seeds,
if that's a, this is a filly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you make seeds, what comes out of
there is the filial generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are the same filial generation
that you're crossing, then you move
[SPEAKER_00]: forward in filial generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cross to anything else,
you are making a new F1 or a batch back
[SPEAKER_00]: cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that will sum up that part of
the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you only cross one plant to another
plant and then you get those seeds and you
[SPEAKER_00]: find a male and a female out of those or a
female that you reverse out of those and
[SPEAKER_00]: cross that again, that is an F2 because
that's a filial generation moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you moved backwards using a previous
parent or a previous mom, now you are
[SPEAKER_00]: going backwards to a back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that makes it clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the chunk of this I want to focus on
is something you really said at the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning was a feminized plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said, can I do this with feminized
seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of myths, misconceptions,
misunderstandings, rumors, falsities,
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whackness, fuckery around feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of rumors and shit that
people don't simply do not understand
[SPEAKER_00]: around feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is understandable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you only learn from the internet,
if you only learn from what your cousin's
[SPEAKER_00]: uncles told you that he heard from his
brother in Vietnam that they met at a boot
[SPEAKER_00]: camp one time, that info is old and who
knows what the fuck that person really
[SPEAKER_00]: said.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody heard one thing because we
only half pay attention when we fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to each other anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people have misinformation,
misconceptions, bad info about femme
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feminized seeds are no different than a
regular seed other than the fact that the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen, the pollen is the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollen was the part that was
feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are the same exact thing as a
male female plant, except you won't find
[SPEAKER_00]: that male chromium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to borrow a lesson from my
friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Soul, big shout out to Mr. Soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Soul and his amazing dude puts out
some great seeds, puts out the Cindy 99
[SPEAKER_00]: and some other great shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Brothers Grim Seed
Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Soul made the greatest analogy that I
can ever think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't come up with anything better than
this, but I want to give him credit
[SPEAKER_00]: because give credit when credit is due.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to honor and credit your
teachers, your masters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something Mr. Soul taught us the best way
I can explain it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we make feminized pollen,
we are reversing a female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a full here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go on a side tangent of my
tangent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're walking down alleys holding hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this together.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say that when we make
femme seeds, we are using a treatment to
[SPEAKER_00]: make the female plant become a
hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are not intersex or
hermaphroditic plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they were, I would not be making seeds
with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stress test them and make sure they are
not intersex plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm doing is not causing
hermaphroditism or intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is hermaphrodite intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not the right word here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are treated and reversed to make
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are female plants creating pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're treated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get that correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the part that Mr. Soul taught us.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we make feminized seeds, we are
treating the female plant a fully female
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I touch on that again, fully female.
[SPEAKER_00]: We treat that with a either silver
thiosulfate or colloidal silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer the thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say it today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking promise I know what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer the silver thiosulfate method
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do the other way or any other way,
have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Power to the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have learned how to make female
plants produce pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Soul taught us that basically we have
learned to put up a filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine your male plant, your pollen
donor, or in this case our reversed female
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's making pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's jizzing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's busting a load.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's doing its thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to sneeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's making you fucking sneeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here, we've got female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got their hairs like you guys like
to call them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're ready to get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their female parts are sticking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are horny.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got dudes blowing loads or a
reversed female blowing a load.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got ladies over here ready to get
it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Somehow through the magic of science,
basically what we have done by reversing
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants, Mr. Soul says we put up a
screen that works as a filter that only
[SPEAKER_00]: sucks out male pollen because the sex is
determined through the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That pollen is going to hit a female
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those chromosomes then are going to mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's male chromosomes in there,
that's when the plants will decide if
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll be a male or a female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already got the female pollen going
over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: No male pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only difference is we basically
found a filter or a vacuum and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: sucking out the male pollen out of the sky
before that male sperm ever lands on the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only female sperm, female pollen
getting over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're only making female babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not the scientific method,
but that is the easiest way to explain it
[SPEAKER_00]: that most people will understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, credit to Mr. Soul for that
explanation because that is the most
[SPEAKER_00]: reliable, teachable explanation I've ever
heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have found a way to suck out the male
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only big difference in these seeds
in the offspring is that there will not be
[SPEAKER_00]: any males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is science and nature coming
together and nature always has a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen full-on male plants pop up
from feminized projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is highly unlikely and highly uncommon,
but it does happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just because this is nature and
science and we cannot control everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have seen Jurassic Park.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life does find a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit does happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we do this correctly, we should
come up with 99.9% pure female pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, with that being said, there should
not be any significant difference in the
[SPEAKER_00]: performance of a feminized or a regular
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should both germinate the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should veg at the same rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you're going to have strain
dependent variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some strains that simply veg
slower than others and it doesn't matter
[SPEAKER_00]: if they came from a fem seed or a regular
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the vigor and growth of that
specific plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly do not think that regular or
feminized has anything to do with it
[SPEAKER_00]: because sometimes the slower growing
plants honestly can be those regular
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they germinate the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They veg the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They flower the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency will be the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here's something that I will say can
be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found two variables as I'm thinking
about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find less intersex plants in packs of
feminized seeds than I do in regular
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, since we've got feminized seeds
dialed down and breeders are doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: work, I do find more problematic seeds in
regular packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is something I do notice that I
will testify to as something who pops a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of seeds, grows a lot of plants,
works with a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do see more anomalies, more variables,
more freaks from the regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another thing I can testify to is
there is likely and commonly less
[SPEAKER_00]: variation in feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we're making a self plant,
if we're making, let's say, golden goat
[SPEAKER_00]: self seeds, a golden goat feminized plant,
I cut a clone of golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut another clone of golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I treat one with our silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's thiosulfate or colloidal silver,
whichever, we treat one clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use that pollen to put on what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: What genetics are in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pure golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to find anything but
golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see some grandparents,
some parent traits of golden goat,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're not going to find adulterated
golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other option is golden goat BX,
which of course you've got another plant
[SPEAKER_00]: in there, another line of genetics which
adulterate that, which give you way more
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypical options.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my opinion, in my experience,
in my testimony, I see and find less
[SPEAKER_00]: variation amongst feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a pro to the fem seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to try to say that there's no
difference and that they're even,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we have found a solid difference here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the regular seeds, I do find more
problems, more mutants, more weirdos,
[SPEAKER_00]: more intersex plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the fems, I see less variation,
more reliability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is what we are calling stability in
the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's elaborate on this a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of this question was about breeding
with fems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I often get asked, can you breed with
feminized seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you keep mothers of feminized seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer to all of that is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just like a regular male female
plant, except you did not have to fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: with the male plants when you were doing
the sexing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the breeder did the work, that
feminized seed will be everything the
[SPEAKER_00]: same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll have the vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said this before, it will be all the
traits, all the qualities, all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: abilities of a regular plant, except you
don't have to worry about getting a male
[SPEAKER_00]: in that pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes, there's no way to get a
certain strain like real Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: People talk about they've got Gorilla Glue
number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way you've got, it was a clone
only.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you got the clone, if you bought
seeds, they had to be feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: because there was nothing put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no seeds put out of the Gorilla
Glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you wanted seeds of it, you had to
get feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had to be the Gorilla Glue,
cut a clone, cut another clone,
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse it, put it on the Gorilla Glue,
make feminized self seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the only way to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, you had to adulterate it and
cross it to whatever I was working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it King Solomon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I hit the Gorilla Glue with Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I've got something in the works
right now with a feminized Gorilla Glue
[SPEAKER_00]: project coming up that I don't want to
talk about yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason that we do a lot of fem
stuff is because it is simply not
[SPEAKER_00]: available in the regular form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, we don't want to put out
misrepresentations of our lines out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put out Golden Goat fem seeds and I
don't want to ruin the reputation of
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Goat by putting out bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did work hard at making sure that
those seeds were correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got on a big ramble there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there are less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use feminized seeds for anything
that you can use a regular male female
[SPEAKER_00]: seed for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make a mom out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cut clones with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can breed to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do anything and it will work
beautifully if you have done your
[SPEAKER_00]: selection properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that goes back to if the breeder did
their work properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they select female plants that did not
show any intersex traits?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they select plants that handle stress
well, handle bugs well, possibly pathogens
[SPEAKER_00]: well, abuse well?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really try when I'm making fem seeds
that are going to market, I try to find
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that you can beat the shit out of
because I want my clients to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a product that they can beat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to set them up for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I find plants that can take abuse,
can handle pests, pathogens, problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So did the breeder do the work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they stress test their plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they sex test them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they intersex test them and put them
through the ringer before they bred to
[SPEAKER_00]: them?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they did all that part, then you did
your proper selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you selected your females and you ran
them through a few stress tests a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of times, did the proper phenohunt,
then if you're going to breed with them,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will work just like any other seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk again about lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a, it's a lemon skunk plant from
greenhouse seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it in a pack of seeds as a gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a champion lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came from seed, so nobody's got the one
that I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the best parts about growing
from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got this phenotype that you don't
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got the lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reversed golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put that reversed golden goat pollen
onto the lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now made lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got the prized keeper of lemon
Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the champion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This cut of lemon Jeffrey does everything
you would want it to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hits in potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hits in weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a perfect fucking plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took that plant and I pollinated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did I pollinate it with?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've hit it with the grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also hit it with, oh, the grateful
dog is also feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great thing to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grateful dog is feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Jeffrey is feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have reversed the grateful dog and put
that pollen on the feminized lemon Jeffrey
[SPEAKER_00]: and that makes amazing what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Feminized offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've never released those to many
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put out some testers and then my social
media accounts got squashed right as I put
[SPEAKER_00]: those out and I lost contact with all
those testers and I've only got a few
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds left.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can make more, but that's not what I'm
going to do right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also with that, what else have we made?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have made lemon sunrise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's lemon Jeffrey to the Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a regular King Solomon,
regular male to a feminized plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: makes amazing offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, I do keep a lemon Jeffrey mother
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grateful dog is a feminized mother
plant, which has been around for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time, which has been bred to regular and
feminized stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've done it both ways, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done regular male plants to feminized
females and I've done reversed females to
[SPEAKER_00]: regular females, which sounds weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done everything you can think about
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reverse to regular, regular to reverse,
reverse to reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it all and they all work because
they are plants and that feminized factor
[SPEAKER_00]: only makes a difference when it comes to
making the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ensuring that the consumer,
the customer, the clientele, the grower
[SPEAKER_00]: ends up with a feminized seed,
a feminized plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've covered my notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I covered all the bullet points I
wanted to touch on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how long this episode was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I was going fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels kind of quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once again, I don't need to ramble and
make this too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would just get worse from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start wrapping it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies, gentlemen, boys, girls,
pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers,
[SPEAKER_00]: grovers, clone cutters, Paul and Chuckers,
