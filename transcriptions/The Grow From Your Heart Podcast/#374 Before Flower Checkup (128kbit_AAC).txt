[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 374 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company and you can find them at www
.dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took a gigantic dab of Sour Clem
Ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label says it has 71.1% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a total of 85.7% cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not have much more information on
the label here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This came from our friends at Apothecary
Farms in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, Apothecary has recently
opened a Pueblo location, so make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today I picked up the Sour Clem
Ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is sour diesel and clementine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a really sweet, delicious,
orangey, citrusy clementine aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Followed by a funky, sour diesel-y,
just nasty aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the background, and I say nasty,
but I mean it in the best way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is pungent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you dab it, it goes straight
to the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes your eyes open wide up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes you talk a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes you real rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this will be great podcast
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to our friends at Apothecary
Farms and an extra big shout out to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really digging this batch of Sour Clem
Ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, let's jump into a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do another grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing a long series of grow
lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new listener, I suggest you go
back to at least episode 351 and start on
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow lesson series.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like you're caught up,
welcome to the grow lessons today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to do a before flower
checkup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far in my grow lessons, we should have
healthy, happy veg plants that are in
[SPEAKER_00]: their final finishing pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggested three, five or seven gallon
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go larger, you do it your
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you've topped these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a nice canopy going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you've got a big, fat,
healthy root system going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're aiming for healthy, happy plants
that are thriving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we don't have any bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you haven't over fertilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you haven't had any pH issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we haven't had any environmental
problems that we didn't expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully everything's going well and
you've got big, fat, healthy plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: are almost ready to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably about knee high at this
point, maybe a little bit taller,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on what kind of lights you're
using, what kind of genetics you're
[SPEAKER_00]: working with, how often you've been
feeding them, what kind of treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: you've been giving them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our plants are probably getting large
enough to consider putting them into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we go into flower, I feel like
there are a few important points we should
[SPEAKER_00]: cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go over my before flower checkup.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it gets close to flower time,
one of the first things I think about is,
[SPEAKER_00]: do I have clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have clones for the next run?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to be self-sufficient?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, you need to create clones for your
next run before you put your plants into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend taking clones from
flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will teach you how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not my style.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend that you get your
clones from your vegging plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before you put your plants into flower,
do you have clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a way to supply plants for
your next cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plan on growing from seed again,
or if you plan on purchasing new clones
[SPEAKER_00]: from a friend or a dispensary or however
you get your clones, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to be self-sufficient,
now is the time to think about making
[SPEAKER_00]: clones from your current plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you decide that you want to be
self-sufficient, you've got a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: options.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to designate one of your
clones as a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the idea behind a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A mother plant is a clone of a plant that
we have grown and tested and we know is
[SPEAKER_00]: reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that that plant is a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that it puts off a good harvest
weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that it is potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that it tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hopefully have learned that it is
pathogen and pest resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a reliable strain that we
want to keep around in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way we do that is just by keeping
it in a vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perpetually, and then we can take clones
from it as needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way you keep that mother plant in a
vegetative stage is by leaving it under at
[SPEAKER_00]: least 18 hours of light every day for
mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I would recommend 20 on and four
off, maybe for stubborn mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may even go all the way up to 24 hours
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked a little bit about that in
previous episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also done a full episode about mother
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggest you check out episode 315 for a
full breakdown of mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you don't have room and space for
an extra plant, maybe you just can't have
[SPEAKER_00]: that extra plant because of your plant
count, because of state laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another option is to clone off of your veg
plants perpetually.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people will say that will create
something we used to call genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not believe in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants are healthy, I've done a
full episode on that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea of taking clones from your veg
plants is very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're about to go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right before you take them into the
flower, take a couple of clones off of
[SPEAKER_00]: each of your veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have faith in your clone taking
skills and you don't have room for an
[SPEAKER_00]: extra mother plant, this is an ideal way
to do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, some people may claim that this
will result in genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not believe in genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe in it so much that I have
changed my vocabulary to where I call what
[SPEAKER_00]: is known as genetic drift to regenerative
mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a full episode on genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to learn more about it,
I recommend you listen to the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's episode number 343 and it's
actually titled genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggest you give it a listen and
understand why we now call it regenerative
[SPEAKER_00]: mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point of that rant is to make sure
that you have got clones for your next
[SPEAKER_00]: run.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a supplier, a provider,
or a source for your next batch of clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: it may be really advantageous to take a
few clones, start vegging them out,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that way you've got another crop lined
up before you even have this one finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really want to max productivity of
your grow, you'll start running what is
[SPEAKER_00]: known as a perpetual grow where you use
two spaces, you've got a veg space,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a flowering space.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as that flowering crop is done,
you cut it down, you clean the room,
[SPEAKER_00]: you reset the room, and you drag a set of
flowering plants right back in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you never miss a beat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That room never gets a break, so you're
always on top of production, which means
[SPEAKER_00]: you always have to have a supply of
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll have veg plants, you'll cut a
few clones off of them, you'll cut down
[SPEAKER_00]: your flowering plants, you'll clean up
that room, drag those veg plants right
[SPEAKER_00]: into there, and then you'll start growing
those little clones up into the next
[SPEAKER_00]: batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be your veg plants, you have to
top them, you have to train them,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a full nine weeks to get them
as big as you need them and get them
[SPEAKER_00]: prepared for the next run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when that flowering crop gets done that
you've got in the flowering room,
[SPEAKER_00]: you cut it down, clean it up, drag those
veg plants right in there, but before you
[SPEAKER_00]: do that, you take a few clones so that you
can keep the cycle going.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is to create a perpetual cycle
for yourself so you're always
[SPEAKER_00]: self-sufficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never have to bring anything in from
outside, that way you can keep the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: clean, that way you know if you get any
bugs or any pests it's your fault,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't blame anybody else, but it
really limits the opportunities to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: in problems and it also helps you develop
a relationship with one strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you run a perpetual grow with just one,
maybe two strains max, you can really dial
[SPEAKER_00]: those strains in, you can build a
relationship with them, and then you can
[SPEAKER_00]: get them to reach their full potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several ways to do perpetual
grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it by swapping the whole room,
you can do it by having part of the room
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest every couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a full episode on that,
but I do plan to redo it in the future for
[SPEAKER_00]: a six plant count because Colorado is now
limited to six plants for recreational or
[SPEAKER_00]: medical patients, so I will do a revised
perpetual grow episode based on a six
[SPEAKER_00]: plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in listening to the
current or maybe the old scheduling a
[SPEAKER_00]: perpetual grow episode, that is episode
number 73.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is a great episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a lot of time and effort into
creating that episode, so episode 73 all
[SPEAKER_00]: about creating a perpetual grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let me get myself back on
track.
[SPEAKER_00]: My point is to make sure you have got
either a source for clones or clones for
[SPEAKER_00]: your next run, and also it is always a
good idea to think about becoming more
[SPEAKER_00]: self-sufficient and you can do so by
creating a perpetual grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the next thing on my checklist that I
would think about in this brand new grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room that we just recently built is,
do we have any light leaks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have grow lights leaking out into
the outside, and do we have outside lights
[SPEAKER_00]: leaking into the inside?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very important to find out before
we go into the flower phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to go in that grow room and turn
off the grow lights and sit in there for
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 or 20 minutes and let your eyes adjust
to the total darkness and see if you see
[SPEAKER_00]: any light at all in your flowering room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can see any light, that is too
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should not be able to see your hand in
front of your own face.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be completely dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done an episode called total
darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check that one out also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any light leaks in the flowering phase are
going to cause your plants problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're either going to get no flowering at
all, you're going to get slow flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you're going to get hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get plants that will start to
flower and they'll never finish,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you just may get crazy weird mutated
plants because of an odd light leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go in the grow room, turn off all the
grow lights, and just sit there for a few
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your phone away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have any light making your eyes do
weird things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let there be total darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let your eyes adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you see any light, you need to
correct it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need some of that silver foil tape,
or maybe you need to fill the gaps with
[SPEAKER_00]: some caulk and cover it up with some duct
tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just seal up all of those light leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if your grow room is on an exterior
wall, meaning that wall is next to the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside, or if there is a lot of activity
on the opposite side of the wall of which
[SPEAKER_00]: you are growing, I suggest you go in your
grow room and turn off the grow lights
[SPEAKER_00]: during either the sunshine hours or the
busy hours of that room and see if any of
[SPEAKER_00]: the light from either the sun or that
adjacent room are leaking into your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room during their busy hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your grow room has a window and the sun
is shining on that window and the curtains
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't thick enough to block out that sun,
or whatever you've put over that window is
[SPEAKER_00]: not thick enough to block out that
sunlight, we need to know that before we
[SPEAKER_00]: go into the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun may come up an hour before your
grow lights come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may start getting a full hour of
sunlight coming through that window that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're unaware of and that's going to
disrupt their flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go in there and check it all hours and
see if you are getting total darkness,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially the hours you plan on putting
your plants in their night cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that room is actually dark and
if it's not, correct it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the next thing we need to do is the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to go outside and make sure that
none of our grow room lights are leaking
[SPEAKER_00]: to the outside, especially if you're
running your grow lights during the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside night cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are lighting up the outside
neighborhood with your grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those grow lights are going to bring
unwanted attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will bring thieves and law
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you're not leaking any light
out of your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is also a good time to start thinking
about, when am I going to run my flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want the lights on when it's dark
outside?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want the lights on when it's light
outside?
[SPEAKER_00]: Electricity is cheaper during off peak
hours, which means when all the business
[SPEAKER_00]: is closed and everybody goes home,
electricity gets cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look on your bill and find out
when peak and off peak hours are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since electricity is more affordable at
off peak hours, many growers will choose
[SPEAKER_00]: to run their lights during those hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when the sun is not up, we don't
have to try to keep the room cool with the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow lights and the sun competing against
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the sun goes down, it automatically
gets a little bit cooler outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can fire up your grow lights and you
don't have as much heat to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a place that gets really
cold, you can run those grow lights at
[SPEAKER_00]: night and it will really help keep your
house warm if you've got a small house and
[SPEAKER_00]: you run the ducting right and you plan
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know several East Coast growers that
used to keep their apartments warm by
[SPEAKER_00]: setting up a four or 600 watt light in the
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would kick out a small winter crop of
super potent cannabis out of their very
[SPEAKER_00]: small apartment and they would also use
that same light to keep themselves warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a very efficient way to do
things back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now is a good time to start thinking
about when you're going to run your lights
[SPEAKER_00]: in your flowering room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably have to go to work part of
the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want those lights to come on right
when you get home from work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want those lights to come on so you
can work on the plants before you go to
[SPEAKER_00]: work?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a lot of things to plan and
think about now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggest you work on the plants after
work because you don't want to go to work
[SPEAKER_00]: smelling like dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people work a day job nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to go to work and then
you'll get off hopefully in the evening,
[SPEAKER_00]: come home, work on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That works out really well because you are
now on off peak electricity hours and it
[SPEAKER_00]: is nighttime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not fighting that heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to run as much electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get off work, come home,
work on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can take a nice shower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you don't stink for work next day and
nobody knows that you're growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were in a place, you need to keep
it on the down low.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since I'm talking about being careful
and keeping it on the down low,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you have a carbon filter set up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is your filtration in place?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you ready for a stinky crop of
flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: In just a few weeks, these plants are
going to start stinking very heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get a nice aroma around 20 days
in, depending on your genetics and what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using for nutrients and the airflow
in your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the time to order a carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't already, you need to get
that set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get it in place and you need
to start controlling the aroma,
[SPEAKER_00]: leaving your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I need to back up and cover one thing
that I overlooked when I was talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: light leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you were using vented lights,
which means you have got a light with
[SPEAKER_00]: glass between the bulb and the plant
canopy and that's all sealed up in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's got a duct coming off of one end
and off of the other and you're blowing a
[SPEAKER_00]: blower over it to get that heat from the
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you were using a light out of the
grow space, a lot of people will run that
[SPEAKER_00]: ducting to the outside of the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll run it out of a window just to
make it go outside of the house somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times the sunshine will reflect
right down that ducting and come into your
[SPEAKER_00]: light reflector and work just like a
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were channeling that light down that
ducting right into your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were not doing that while the
lights are on, you were lighting up the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and disrupting your night cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were using ducted hoods and you
were running that to the outside of the
[SPEAKER_00]: house, you may need to adjust the duct to
where the light does not make it into your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the inside of that ducting
is quite often made with a very reflective
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably going to have to give it a
lot of bends or you'll have to create a
[SPEAKER_00]: baffle at the end of it toward the light
is not allowed to even enter down that
[SPEAKER_00]: ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another option is to get a can of flat
black spray paint and spray paint the
[SPEAKER_00]: inside as far as you can make that spray
paint go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put a nice little black layer in
there and take that reflective layer off
[SPEAKER_00]: and that will prevent the light from
getting in there as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still may need to make a bend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to put some sort of light
baffle over it, but please check and see
[SPEAKER_00]: if the light is coming through your ducted
hoods and disrupting your night cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sunshine will make it so far down that
ducting you will be amazed and just one
[SPEAKER_00]: little speckle of sunlight will completely
disrupt your flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think the plants are in the dark
and they're getting that one little
[SPEAKER_00]: pinprick of sunlight, they're not in the
dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also take a quick look at all of the
equipment in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does your air conditioner have blue and
red lights on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there something in the grow room that's
illuminating a blue display?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any lights in there,
you need to put some tape or some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: a flap over it so that light does not
disrupt your flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only color of light that is acceptable
during the night cycle is a green light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are still situations where I
have seen those green lights cause
[SPEAKER_00]: problems with people's plants by running
that green light too much during a dark
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would prefer it be completely dark in
your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nobody in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are sleeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want any light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it as dark as you can get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it scary dark and then a little
bit darker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want us to be able to see your
hand in front of your face when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: touching your nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how dark we need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I've done an episode called total
darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give that one a listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't understand why total darkness
is so important in our indoor grow
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing on my pre flower checklist,
is can you correctly identify females,
[SPEAKER_00]: males, and hermaphrodites?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are running from seed, especially
you have got the option to run into
[SPEAKER_00]: females, males, or hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be able to identify these very
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find a male in the garden,
it needs to be cold immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you come across a hermaphroditic plant
early in flower, you need to know what
[SPEAKER_00]: that looks like so you can get it out of
the grow room before it causes you
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants are going to start showing sex
somewhere around 10 days into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: By day 12 or 14, it will be really obvious
if you've got male or female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: By day 12 or 14, your female plants will
be able to receive pollen from the male
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not paying attention,
sometimes by day 10 or 12, a male plant
[SPEAKER_00]: can open up and start dropping pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now your whole crop is pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is going to have seeds in it
and you didn't even know because you
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we get to this risky phase,
open up some books, do some Google
[SPEAKER_00]: searches, and learn to identify a female
cannabis plant, learn to confidently
[SPEAKER_00]: identify a male cannabis plant,
and learn how to identify a plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: shows both sexes in the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the next episode, I plan to talk about
phenohunting and selecting a mother plant
[SPEAKER_00]: from that phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that episode, I will also include a
talk about sexing our cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very important at this phase and
this stage of the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to know how to confidently
identify males and females.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be able to provide you detailed
descriptions, but I recommend you look
[SPEAKER_00]: online for pictures of males and females
of cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very easy to spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you look a few times, it will become
very obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need to develop the confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will include a talk about it on the
next episode, but you will still need to
[SPEAKER_00]: go look in a book or look online and get a
good visual understanding of what you are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for so you can spot it right away
if something should pop up in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now another thing you should think about
before you put your plants into flower is,
[SPEAKER_00]: are they healthy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you burned them with nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they nutrient deficient?
[SPEAKER_00]: We may want to get them a little healthier
before you put them into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want these plants as healthy as we can
get them before they go into the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another important thing to think about is,
do you have any pest infestations?
[SPEAKER_00]: We aren't able to spray the plants with as
many products once we get bud set,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we want to eradicate any pest problems
before we go into flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do have a pest problem at this
time, it is time to step up the frequency
[SPEAKER_00]: of the sprays and quite possibly increase
the potency of your sprays if not start
[SPEAKER_00]: introducing new products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not want to enter the flowering
phase with a known pest problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is much easier to combat a pest problem
while in veg, so let's focus on getting
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of any problems now and then we can
move to flower a week late if that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to do or we can adjust our plans
accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's make sure to get rid of every
bug before we move to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, we should have some
backup clones for the next run.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that the room is dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know there are no light leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no light getting in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no light getting out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our aroma control.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no stinky air getting out of the
grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, the number one way people get in
trouble is by having stinky air coming out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Control that aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you take care of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are allowed to grow cannabis in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are just fine until somebody comes in
and complains and says they can smell your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, they send out an
investigator and they come knock on your
[SPEAKER_00]: door and ask to look and see how many
plants you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got too many plants,
you do get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no matter how many plants you've got,
I recommend you've got some sort of odor
[SPEAKER_00]: control so none of your neighbors get mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody snitches on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody comes knocking on your door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you are within your legal amount
of plants, it is still nerve wracking and
[SPEAKER_00]: stressful to have to deal with law
enforcement because of your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So simply control the odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we've got clones for the next
round.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a nice dark room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are controlling the odor that is
leaving our room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how to identify males,
females, and hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what to call so that we don't
cause any problems in the grow so that we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't seed up our whole grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know there are no pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know we haven't overfed the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are almost ready to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how do we know when to flower these
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of things that will
help us determine when to initiate the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering phase for our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the main factors will be the
height.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much ceiling space do you have in your
grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us are in a residential area.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us are going to be modifying a
bedroom or something similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us may be using grow tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to flower your plants
at a height to where they have plenty of
[SPEAKER_00]: room to grow, to where they don't work
themselves into the lights and you run out
[SPEAKER_00]: of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to plan to leave, depending on
what type of light you're using,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to plan to leave an appropriate
gap between the top of your plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: your light source.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using LEDs, you can get much
closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using the ceramic metal halides,
you can get kind of close.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a high pressure sodium
light, you need to stay kind of a distance
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a double-ended Gavita,
you need to stay even further away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plan for that when you're planning your
flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a good thing to think of when you are
new at growing and you haven't grown a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of crops and you want to prepare for
flowering time and have enough space is
[SPEAKER_00]: prepare for your plants to double in
height.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were growing a sativa strain or
something, a sativa hybrid with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa genetics in there, it could double
in height throughout the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you vet your plant and the plant is
three feet tall, you initiate flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time it is done, you can expect a
six foot tall plant if you're not doing
[SPEAKER_00]: anything to control that vertical growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that case, I would plan to flower
that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have got, if your light is six feet
tall, we're going to say if your light is
[SPEAKER_00]: seven feet tall because we need some
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your light is seven feet off the
ground, I would veg those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I grow them, I would veg
them until they are three feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they are three feet tall,
initiate the flower phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to double in height.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll end about six feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll still have that one foot of space
between the light and the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is not a rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have not grown your strain before,
if you don't know what these genetics are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do, allow yourself room for these
plants to double.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, if you've got plants with big
obvious fat white indica leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: you may not get that doubled growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may only get a little bit of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get stretch for about
three weeks and then they'll slow down on
[SPEAKER_00]: the stretching and the bud sets will
really set in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But try to plan ahead for too much head
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing worse than having a big,
giant, beautiful top cola that is just
[SPEAKER_00]: beefy and covered in trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it starts murdering itself by
growing directly into your lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts touching the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts burning itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts getting ugly colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to think about, do I want to bend
that butt over?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I actually want to cut part of that
off?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I do at this point?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is really heartbreaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plan ahead and try to give yourself
plenty of head space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also keep in mind spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want the plants touching each
other too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just think about if you and I and another
couple of dudes were hanging out in a
[SPEAKER_00]: room, if we all just started spreading our
arms around, just touching each other all
[SPEAKER_00]: weird, you're going to get kind of weirded
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, bro, why are you touching me?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to want your own space.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: When one plant feels another plant touch
it, it indicates to itself, I probably
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't grow much further that way
because I'm already touching a limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other plant says the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've got two plants that have
just stopped out branching and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to start growing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So allow your plants plenty of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spread them out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we do want to maximize canopy space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do want to maximize the space of our
grow, but we don't want to crush them in
[SPEAKER_00]: so much we can't get airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to crush them in so much
that they're uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a little bit of airflow and we
don't want leaves stacking on top of each
[SPEAKER_00]: other because that's where you start
causing problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give them some space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Space your plants out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them some breathing room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them some growing room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind that when you put your
plants into the flowering phase,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are only halfway through their life
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still need to bush out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to grow much taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're only halfway there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So allow that extra space for flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're running a screen of green
or a trellis system, I suggest you veg
[SPEAKER_00]: until you kind of fill up most of that
screen system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is to try to get one little
branch coming through each of those
[SPEAKER_00]: squares in your trellis system.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can maximize that, that's when you
really start cranking out as much bud as
[SPEAKER_00]: you can produce in your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I suggest you fill that canopy up and
fill that screen up before you flower
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're spreading it out nice and
wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going straight up like the guys
without the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're spreading it out, you've still
got all that vertical growth left for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can spread it out, then put it into
flower and it's going to grow vertically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend you use all of that screen
space to the best of your ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I feel like that is a good
explanation of when to flower the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to give yourself about double the
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to allow some space between the
lights and the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also want to give the plants some
space so they can breathe and so they can
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you've done any topping,
I would definitely recommend 10 to 14 days
[SPEAKER_00]: of recovery time before you move the
plants into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plan ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do all of your topping plenty of time in
advance so the plants can heal,
[SPEAKER_00]: so they can redistribute the hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way the plant can produce big fat
chunky top buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you top a plant and move it into flower
too soon, you'll notice those top buds
[SPEAKER_00]: don't really produce the colas that we're
expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give your plant time to recover from
topping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let those hormones move around and it will
make a huge difference in the productivity
[SPEAKER_00]: of your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like that is a pretty good
before flower checklist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure the plants are healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you understand how to find
males, females and hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're pest free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And make sure you've got a good idea of
when to flower those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to set a schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to stick to it as long as you are pest
free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest that you keep twisting and
popping the stems, making those stalks
[SPEAKER_00]: nice and robust until it's time to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep pulling off any yellow or funky
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the plants looking nice and healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them thriving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it's time to flower, flip that
timer to 1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a note of what day you did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you are in the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several people have asked me when
flowering starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does flowering start the day you change
the timer to 1212?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or does flowering start the day you start
seeing buds set?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are looking at a package of seeds
and it says these seeds will take 8 to 10
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks to flower, that 8 to 10 weeks starts
the day you change your timer to 1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: The day you do the flip is the beginning
of your flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when that new schedule,
that new calendar, the new countdown,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is when that begins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are running 24 hours or 20 on
and 4 off or 18 and 6 in veg, you just go
[SPEAKER_00]: in and you change that timer to 12 hours
on and 12 hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is day one of your flowering
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: In about 10 to 12 days, you'll start
seeing pre-flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants will start showing you sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to go through and start pulling
out all of the boys by this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: By day 14, the boys will be very obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be getting ready to pollinate if
they have not already dropped pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay close attention to the boys and get
them out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the first two or three weeks,
of flowering, you're going to focus
[SPEAKER_00]: heavily on looking for male plants and
plants with hermaphrodite traits and
[SPEAKER_00]: removing them from the garden safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I suggest that you start now
doing some research on understanding what
[SPEAKER_00]: a male and a female and a hermaphrodite
cannabis plant look like so that when you
[SPEAKER_00]: are 8, 10, 12 or 14 days into flower,
you are certain what you see and you are
[SPEAKER_00]: confident so that you can make the correct
decision to keep your garden in top shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I feel like that is a great place
to stop because my next lesson is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be about phenohunting and sexing the
plants and selecting a mother plant from
[SPEAKER_00]: that phenohunt process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to work our way into the
flowering stage of the grow lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, it is almost time to flower
the hypothetical plants in the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is coming up very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will talk in depth about probably three
week chunks of the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll probably do week one through three
and then we'll do four through six and
[SPEAKER_00]: then we'll do seven through nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was hard for my brain to process that
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is my idea for the flowering
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to break it down into three,
three week chunks and then we'll talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about finishing the plants up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is coming up very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like this is a great place to
wrap up this episode.
