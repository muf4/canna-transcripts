[SPEAKER_00]: Happy 710, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be the 710 celebration episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people may be confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going, what is 710?
[SPEAKER_00]: But have no fear because this episode will
be focused on teaching you and explaining
[SPEAKER_00]: what 710 is all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is 710?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you probably already know about
420.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're watching this show, if you're a
cannabis consumer, if you're part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: community, you're probably very familiar
with 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: 420 is when we celebrate cannabis
consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to get together at 420,
smoke a bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be the code in high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey bro, you want to bust out a little 420
between classes or meet me at this place
[SPEAKER_00]: at lunch for a little bit of 420 or meet
me at 420 for some 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just kind of cool to smoke down at
420.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 420 got super popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't listened to my podcast
about 420, it was started by a group of
[SPEAKER_00]: young men who called themselves the
Waldo's.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would meet every day after school at
420 and smoke together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why my friends and I, a bunch of
the Grateful Dead community is where it
[SPEAKER_00]: got popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it traveled around.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of my friends and myself,
we all started saying 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody around us was saying 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got super popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we started seeing 420 festivals and
420 events.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got really commercialized with the
legalization of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is where 420 came from and 420 got
popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's segue into 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is 710?
[SPEAKER_00]: With the evolution of cannabis
legalization has also come the evolution
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the greatest things to come out of
this evolution in my opinion is high
[SPEAKER_00]: quality cannabis concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's shatter, if it's batter,
if it's rosin, whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: I love a high quality cannabis
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it first started getting popular,
BHO concentrates were known as oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would come out looking like honey
oil, BHO, butane honey oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to tell you how it's done,
but you would use butane and some products
[SPEAKER_00]: and the resulting product would look like
oil and it would look like honey.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call it butane honey oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We learned how to refine it, do a bunch of
different things to it, but that BHO,
[SPEAKER_00]: that butane honey oil, it looked like oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were calling it oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we realized that if you turn the
number 710 upside down on the clock,
[SPEAKER_00]: it does spell the word oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: 710, flip it upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why at 710, we smoke some oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why 710 has become the new 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why 710 has become the new 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have upgraded a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do find that 710 is a little bit more
convenient a lot of the time compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes me much less time to prepare and
consume a dab than it does to prepare and
[SPEAKER_00]: consume as much cannabis as it would to
get me where I want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there's not as much aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take a dab, some of the dabs I've
got on the table smell like straight up
[SPEAKER_00]: candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I hit this blue fruit right here,
it's not going to smell like I just smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: a blunt in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to smell like I smoked a
fat joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to smell like this fruity blue
candy, incense, potpourri, delightful air
[SPEAKER_00]: freshener stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may be a little bit easier to
conceal and it makes it a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: convenient for a lot of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've talked about what 710 means.
[SPEAKER_00]: 710 is simply oil upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is when we smoke a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of you have that 420 alarm set on
your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: When 420 comes, we all got to get together
and smoke a bowl, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: At 710, we take dabs in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of places are taking dabs at 710,
definitely here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 710 is oil upside down and that is dab
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to give a big shout out to my
friend Task Rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Task Rock from Highly Educated Titanium,
now also Highly Educated Quartz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also from Task and Linus T&L, The
Movement, big up to Task Rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also big shout out to our friends from
Healthstone Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may have been other people in the
room, but to the best of my knowledge,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a meeting and people were
talking about the new term.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Task Rock is the one who
coined the phrase 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go ahead right here on the
show and give credit to Task for coining
[SPEAKER_00]: the phrase.
[SPEAKER_00]: 710, I want to make sure that he got that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we talk about 710, I keep saying
the word dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people might not even know what a dab
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is a dab?
[SPEAKER_00]: A dab, when I talk about a dab,
a dab is a hit of a concentrate,
[SPEAKER_00]: a hit of a cannabis concentrate,
just a hit, just one consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why we call it a dab,
let me just go ahead and get out a dab
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to open a brand new package of
Blue Fruit Live Batter from Green Dot
[SPEAKER_00]: Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody pays me to talk about this product,
but I'm just going to talk about it for
[SPEAKER_00]: the fun of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we're here, this is Blue Fruit Live
Batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of Sex on the Beach and
Black and Blue, two different strains
[SPEAKER_00]: extracted together in the same machine and
the same device on the same run.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes one great tasting concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do describe the flavor of this
concentrate as blueberry, cheesecake,
[SPEAKER_00]: and exotic fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back, it says it contains 74.99%
THC and non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little pull here tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can pull this and probably get more
information if we open this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't usually do that, but let's see
what's in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, through the magic of editing,
I got that really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I opened the little book on the back
of the package here, I've never done this
[SPEAKER_00]: with this brand, I don't think,
I pop it open and it says, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: we should talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does say the grow where it was grown
and it says the infused product place
[SPEAKER_00]: where it was processed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got those two numbers on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't see the numbers, but I see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a 403R and a 404R number.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any problem with this product,
they could trace this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to that cultivation facility and that
extraction lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's cool that they've got that on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wanted to mention that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside this little book, it says extracted
using 99.9% distilled and butane.
[SPEAKER_00]: This product was produced without
regulatory oversight for health,
[SPEAKER_00]: safety, or efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This product complies with testing
requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be long-term physical or mental
health risks from use of marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: including additional risks for women who
are or may become pregnant or are
pregnant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Car breastfeeding, use of marijuana may
impair your ability to drive a car or
[SPEAKER_00]: operate machinery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intended use, inhaled product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that is the end of the book
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's the end of the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does come with a nice little warning
label, a bunch of stuff on the inside
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're gonna crack this open.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are getting to the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it smells so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells disgustingly good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concentrate's definitely, this batter
definitely has a really concentrated aroma
[SPEAKER_00]: in there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna try to show you this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to lose my concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just bought this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want it to fall out of the jar
there, but I want to put it up on the
[SPEAKER_00]: camera for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't do that, but I'll kind of grab
it, show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a gram of green dot batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it'll focus on that or
not, but we'll try.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to zoom in and editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll put it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna show you why we call it a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we take a dab, we go like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We scoop out just a little piece and most
people would take, I don't know if you can
[SPEAKER_00]: even see it, because it's just a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just get a little dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little dab will do you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of a big dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would make Mike cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna show off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to brag, but this is the
size of dab that I would normally do here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scoop this up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm not talking into the mic,
but this is the kind of dab that I would
[SPEAKER_00]: normally do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something about this size.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a decent size dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna do that while we're here on the
podcast in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the size dab I would normally do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We scoop up a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: A dab is a hit of a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let me talk about what is a
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe concentrate doesn't even make any
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we have cannabis, we have dried
cannabis flower tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's usually what we consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cut off the tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cut off the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We dry and cure the tops, and then we
smoke those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need all of the green leafy
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vegetable part doesn't really do
anything for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the carrier for the potent part.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichomes, the crystals you guys call
them, the little mushrooms that are
[SPEAKER_00]: growing off the weed plants, those are
where the potency is hidden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the potency is in the cap of that
trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through science and technology,
people have learned how to basically rinse
[SPEAKER_00]: or remove all of that potent part from the
green part.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we don't have to smoke a bunch of
green shit to get stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can just smoke the important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've taken the good part and washed it
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, using solvents or water,
we've learned how to just strip that
[SPEAKER_00]: potent part from the green leafy matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the green leafy matter is discarded.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potent part is turned into a delicious
batter, which I do love to consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what a dab is.
[SPEAKER_00]: A dab is a hit of that concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the phrase dab first started,
I think it did refer to a BHO concentrate,
[SPEAKER_00]: because a lot of this movement did evolve
because of the BHO concentrate movement
[SPEAKER_00]: when cannabis became legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to teach you too much about
BHO, about butane extracted products,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that is how it is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to say, that's not safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can't be healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Butane is very clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how to clean it out of the
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's none left in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's lab tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been doing it for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking great products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, a dab was a BHO hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we call a dab basically anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's rosin, if it's batter,
if it's shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put it on the dabber and put it in
the banger and take a dab of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they'll call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just said a bunch of words right there
that you may not even know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the dabber?
[SPEAKER_00]: The dabber is the little stick that I
scoop up the dabber with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the dabber, the stick that I went
and put the dabber on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I am a dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a person who consumes dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep talking here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say concentrates, that means a lot
of different kinds of hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of you older smokers, you'll think
of just old school hash, water hash,
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just basic hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can dab that, but it does make a mess
on your banger sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make concentrates with dry ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people take a sieve bag and dry
ice and product and just shake the shit
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dry ice works as a solvent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works like how you get gum out of your
hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: It freezes up the vegetables and then the
crystals fall off, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not exactly, but that's the short
version of what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people press stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can press plenty of stuff into
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're shattered.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're solventless.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many different styles and
preparations of dabs, but all of that is
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that falls into the label of hash
or concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a very good distinction between
two types of concentrates that people
[SPEAKER_00]: really do love.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is solventless and solvent-based
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: People like to make concentrates with
heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you've heard of people making
rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, people are using any kind of
heat and pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use a hair straightener or a
hydraulic press, but with heat and
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure, people are making rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're squeezing the potency,
the potent part out of the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: squeezing it right out and getting that
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a solventless product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't use any chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: No solvents were used in the making of
that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, people will consider water hash to
be solventless because, yes, I do
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that water is a solvent,
but let me try to quote my friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ Nicky T from Essential Extracts has
taught us that when we are making water
[SPEAKER_00]: hash, water is not being used as a solvent
because trichomes are not water soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is being used as an agitator.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are using ice and water to simply wash
the trichomes off of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not using it as a solvent,
so when we use water and ice to make hash,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is technically solventless
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people really like the
solventless.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that have had seizure problems,
some older people, they're afraid of the
[SPEAKER_00]: butane, so a lot of those folks,
a lot of the younger, the rosin heads,
[SPEAKER_00]: they really love the solventless products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there are people like myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love a butane-extracted product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The product I'm going to dab was made,
I said a moment ago, with 99.9% pure
[SPEAKER_00]: butane, so that's a butane-extracted
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, the butane-extracted
products burn cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't leave any residue on the nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't leave any mess in my rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they work a lot better for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do smoke some rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Dot makes an amazing garlic banger
rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes disgustingly delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells so grossly good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a garlicky trash can with hints
of vomit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds gross, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take four grams right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I smoke that, my lungs feel a little
bit heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes all of me heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me want to sit down and almost
take a nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes my face and my eyes heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost makes me want to cough,
and it leaves a little bit of a gook on my
[SPEAKER_00]: banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rosin doesn't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The live batter doesn't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The live batter gets me a nice head buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: My eyes perk up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start getting wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get active and lively.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the big difference between those
two products, but I do enjoy both of them
[SPEAKER_00]: just in different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rosin from Green Dot is made without
any solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is heat and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the BHO, the batter, is made with the
butane, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like both of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about solventless and solvent
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about rigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said rig just a moment ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that you smoke your oil through
is a rig, an oil rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we call it that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer a little rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my dab rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one I have chosen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of rigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got several rigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my favorite rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my go-to hitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to hold it up here to where you can
see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not very big.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just big enough to where when I put
the dab in the ... This is a banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I put the dab into the banger,
I'll put the carb cap on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll show you that in a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smoke will travel down through here
through these bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always prefer something with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm smoking concentrates, I want it to
go through water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to heat it up pretty hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take a pretty vicious-sized dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need some water to cool that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it comes up through the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I like this really flared-out
mouthpiece.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I take a dab, if the mouthpiece is
too small, I feel like the concentrates
[SPEAKER_00]: stick to my lips, my mustache,
my teeth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I take bigger dabs than the average
bear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the flared-out mouthpiece.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my favorite rig in my collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the most expensive, not the shiniest,
the brightest, but this one punches the
[SPEAKER_00]: hardest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a rig that is small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just enough to get water and enough to get
the smoke cooled off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then a nice flared-out mouthpiece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I do pay attention to when I'm
buying the rig is how far from my eyes and
[SPEAKER_00]: face is the nail or the banger or the
bucket going to be when I'm trying to take
[SPEAKER_00]: a dab?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I going to be able to carb it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I going to be able to work the banger?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't want it right here in my
face where I'm all cross-eyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need it down here by my fingers
where I can't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need it up here where I got to
look up and it's all awkward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the way this one sits.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm buying a rig, I look for
something small.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look for something with a flared
mouthpiece, something that holds water,
[SPEAKER_00]: and something that's not awkward when I'm
going to hit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that's comfortable in my hand,
something that I can function with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put it to my face and give
you an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to go right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can look right into where my banger is
where I'm going to be lining up,
[SPEAKER_00]: putting my dab into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can definitely manage that all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not going to miss, not going to go
cross-eyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're too close, I feel like I go
cross-eyed and it just feels weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a little rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have cleaned it a little better
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some dab residue in there,
but hey, we've been dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the rig is for.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about this part.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: This part comes off right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a separate purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the part where you're going to
heat this and then you're going to put
[SPEAKER_00]: your dab in here and then you'll put the
carb cap on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you the cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cap fits on right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of swirl it around a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that does, when the cap goes on,
it creates a vacuum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the air cannot flow inside of this
area because I've just sealed it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also smoking through here at this
time, so I'm pulling air through here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a small hole in the cap,
so I'm now restricting the airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heat in here now does not need to be
as intense because I've created a vacuum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like putting a lid on the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've trapped the heat in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, my dab will cook at a lower
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll burn more cleanly, more smoothly
without so much heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less heat is a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about heat and
temperature in just a moment, but the less
[SPEAKER_00]: heat on there is better for your lungs,
better for your throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't burn as bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the less heat will work better for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll taste better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't mess up your throat, your lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be a more enjoyable experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I do enjoy a little bit of an
excessively hot dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is my banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I should mention is the sizes of
bangers that are available.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 14 millimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe that 14 millimeter is my
favorite size for the joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that all depends on the size of the
joint on your rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your rig may have a male or a female
joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a male joint on the rig,
a female joint on the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, they meet just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both 14 millimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got a 14 millimeter, 14 mil male,
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: They connect like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 90 degree banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Goes at a 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's nice and flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me show you another option.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, my friends, is a 10 millimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get it out of here real carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to break it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only 10 millimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of delicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's 10 mil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit skinnier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's obviously four millimeters skinnier.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's also a 90 degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can see the shape on the end,
let me hold it over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one goes in, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The piece that goes in is a male,
just like us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The piece that goes in, that's a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: My rig is a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see it's got a hole right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch me do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of rig porn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, that just sits in there just like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this one I've got, let me get them out
of here so I can show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have got these little guys, little glass
balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call them turp pearls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm holding two of them up to the camera
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tiny little glass balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put these in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, when I take a dab, I use a carb cap,
a spinner cap that makes those balls spin
[SPEAKER_00]: around the nail around inside the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that does is it stirs my oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stirs my dab and it makes it move
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It moves it around the hot surface of the
bottom of the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get the whole dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't waste any of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get a little puddle that didn't
get roasted up for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a 10 millimeter banger with a male
joint on the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one we've got over here is a 14
millimeter male I may have done that
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a female 14 millimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Female 14 mil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we've got a male 10 mil over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this rig a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is my favorite though.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about the rig, the nail,
or the banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other options.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of other options for
nails.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get a turp slurper, which then
you're going to need a gasket and a marble
[SPEAKER_00]: and some other stuff for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other options that look
different, but they do the same thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just happens to be my preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like these round bottom bangers with the
carb cap on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just what I prefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just hits real nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I like the flared mouthpiece.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find what you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now talking about finding what you like,
let's talk a little bit about dab
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that I like to take my dabs a
little bit too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people prefer them a little bit
cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a dab right thermometer
or an e-nail, dialing in your dab
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature can take a couple of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to waste a couple of dabs to
figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: My advice would be to just scoop up a dab,
then get your torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't go over the torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically a creme brulee torch from
Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this one because it spits out two
flames.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if the camera will catch
this, but there are two flames coming out
[SPEAKER_00]: of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of blend into one in the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have two little flames,
which really heats up the stuff really
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly, so my banger gets real hot real
quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would scoop up my dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would heat up my banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I heat up the banger, I heat it from
the bottom corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a round bottom banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it were a square bottom, I would heat
it where the floor and the wall meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is kind of the rule of thumb that I
follow, where the floor and the wall meet,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll kind of work my way around it
just a little bit, but I heat right about
[SPEAKER_00]: here because I know just from dabbing a
lot, I know that when I put my dab in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, that's where I'm going to hit,
right there in that corner, and then since
[SPEAKER_00]: I hold it kind of tipped, it all tips to
that direction anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I put the cap on, it's going to start
spinning it around, so I heat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heat it until it almost starts glowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's dirty, I'll clean it with the
torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll heat it until I see that it's hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I let it cool down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I let it cool until I use my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not hot right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep touching.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a loaded gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to keep checking it or a maybe
loaded gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I check it with my finger, my hand,
the palm of my hand, and I can tell by the
[SPEAKER_00]: palm of my hand when the dab is ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it to feel like if I pushed the
banger into my skin, it wouldn't burn the
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck out of me, but it wouldn't be
pleasant at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be like, oh, I burned the shit out of
myself, but then it'd be red for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might get a little blister,
but it's not going to make a fucking big
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it goes and fucks your skin up,
that's way too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a good way to test it,
but if it's sizzling up your skin,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it to feel kind of like a painful
pinch, but not a scary burn when I get
[SPEAKER_00]: close.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm just right about here,
it's like feeling the baby bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to get it close and see what
it feels like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I feel like it's close, then I just
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll give it a pull.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell the temperature of this nail by
pulling through this water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's still super hot, don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still super hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heat it up, let it cool, give it a feel,
then put the dab in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already inhaling as the dab goes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just happens kind of simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a dab on the dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll use the other end, but I go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just happens like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm inhaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put the dab on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts smoking up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your dab goes and sizzles right away,
it shows way too hot, way too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your lungs are going to sizzle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Abort mission, quit inhaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it bubbles up real nice, oh yeah,
next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I forgot a step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your dab in there, set the dabber
down, then grab your trusty carb cap and
[SPEAKER_00]: put that carb cap on top and watch that
shit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it bubbles up and just boils really
smooth, you might have a pretty close
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a good pull.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you getting smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the smoke real thick?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the smoke real thin?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not getting any smoke,
if the dab didn't melt, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not hot enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that shit sizzled up right away,
way too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take a few more dabs and kind of
feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember where you were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is way too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is way too cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then find your middle ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do take a dab and you've got some
concentrates puddled down here in the,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the bottom of your banger, put the carb
cap on it, hit it with the torch for two
[SPEAKER_00]: and a half to three seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's not much time, but that's
enough to get a reheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call that a reheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got your carb cap on here and then
you're just going to hit it with set the
[SPEAKER_00]: torch down, grab the cap and then hit it
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you'll get smoked that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a reheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that worked, that means that the
first time it was not hot enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have super like super accurate
dial it in advice to get the temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer a hotter dab than most people for
a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a trend of you got to waste it
to taste it where people were burning at
[SPEAKER_00]: so low temperature that it would taste
super good, but you'd have to get two
[SPEAKER_00]: Q-tips and clean up the fucking banger
because they would leave so much junk
[SPEAKER_00]: behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't leave shit behind when I take a
dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take mine a little bit hotter than that,
but also sometimes I roast myself and I
[SPEAKER_00]: got to catch my breath and sit down for a
minute, but I kind of enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe I'm a sicko.
[SPEAKER_00]: My advice, like I said, heat it up,
feel it with your hand, feel it,
[SPEAKER_00]: feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it too hot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it not hot enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a dab, maybe waste a few dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang out with your girl, get a gram or two
of concentrates and just take a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs and dial it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get one dab that will make you so
high that you'll be satisfied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a few mental notes like it was way
too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not hot enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn what you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may like it a lot hotter than your
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your bro may like it a lot hotter than
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know what people may like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dial in that temperature the way that
is perfect for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that you may want to do is
get yourself an e-nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's an e-nail?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got devices that plug into the
wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little wire that comes off of a
box that hooks up to your banger or your
[SPEAKER_00]: nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or whatever device it may come with
depending on what company you shop with.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that box it's got a number which you
set it to and that number will control the
[SPEAKER_00]: heat at the end of the nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can get a consistently heated
nail every time you want to dab and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: always on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this had an e-nail cable on it and I
wanted to hit it, I could just grab it
[SPEAKER_00]: right now and take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: There would be no need to heat it up,
no need to torch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would already be ready already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an e-nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great device.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could definitely dial that in,
get that completely perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I'm going to say about the
e-nail, most of those devices,
[SPEAKER_00]: the number on that device does not
correlate with the number on the surface
[SPEAKER_00]: of the nail in temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just a number on the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a volume setting on your car.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got one through whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go with one through 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe your spinal tap and you got 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we got one through 10, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that if I turn my car stereo up to
10, it sounds like total shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm overdoing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The speakers can't handle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gear is not meant to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know if I hover around seven,
it fucking rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's as loud as I want to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know if I get down to six, that's cool
for traffic.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the cops come, I go down to like
number three.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm trying to find an address,
I turn it down to number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do I need it down so low to find an
address?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just weird shit that we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm getting at is that number on
the one through 10 on my car stereo
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't mean that it's coming out at level
10 on the speakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just one through 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are just arbitrary settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not one decibel or 10 decibels.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just one through 10, basically one
through 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm getting at is on that box,
that's not a temperature on the nail that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't correlate as a temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's high, medium, low.
[SPEAKER_00]: But find the number that works for you and
set it at that number.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't think that that number is the
exact temperature that your nail is at
[SPEAKER_00]: because I don't think that that works that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to find out, get yourself a
dab right and then put the dab right under
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn on the email and see what the dab
right measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're new to dabbing and you want to
spend some money, a dab right is a great
[SPEAKER_00]: device.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not have one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've thought about getting one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If dab right would like to advertise on
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll trade you a dab right for a couple of
ads here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll use it on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do it on Instagram live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, enough pitching myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, your ad could be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to do some advertising on
the show, reach out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking high and rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get an email, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dial that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't think that the number on the
email is actually a temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's actually a frequency like
megahertz or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably more likely what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: For on the road dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the Puffco.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, allegedly, possibly,
you may see me hitting this rig in the
[SPEAKER_00]: car.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, I may be hitting a Puffco,
a Puffco Pro, Puffco Peak, whichever the
[SPEAKER_00]: newest one is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growing on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: At first, I didn't like them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take a lot of maintenance and care,
but they are growing on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I should talk about is a
nectar collector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nectar collectors are great if they've got
some water.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy Tenasia is a big fan of the honey
badger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends at the honey
badger.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for an email,
I recommend a Colorado company called the
[SPEAKER_00]: Bee Nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the Bee Nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell them Rasta Jeff sent you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going kind of fast because I feel like
I've been going for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: My throat's getting dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about some more things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most importantly, I want to take a big fat
dab for you and show you how I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else you're going to need if
you're going to start taking dabs are
[SPEAKER_00]: Q-tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned Q-tips earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: After I take a dab, there's going to be a
little bit of stuff left in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Possibly, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do grab a Q-tip and I just give it a
couple of good swirls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean all that shit out there so my banger
is clean and fresh for the next lovely
[SPEAKER_00]: container.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other great accessories you
could think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about the Tert Pearls that I've
got in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do sell a little grabber so you could
pull the pearls out and clean those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use a product called Dark
Crystal Glass Cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark Crystal is from Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use it quite often on a lot of my
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably cleaned all the shit on the
table with it recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good product.
[SPEAKER_00]: My shit's dirty now, so don't judge the
product by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Dark Crystal is a great glass cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got 10, 14, and 18 millimeter
bangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like a rig with water in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've covered all of the notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of my favorite things about dabs is
most of the flour that you buy,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can buy, that is available in a
Colorado dispensary is going to come in
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere between 19 and 30% THC-A.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at the back of this container
of concentrates, this product contains
[SPEAKER_00]: 74.9% THC-A.
[SPEAKER_00]: One big fat dab of this is like basically
smoking two or three regular size joints
[SPEAKER_00]: to the face by yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get to get all that potency into my
bloodstream, into my lungs, into my face,
[SPEAKER_00]: into my brain just that quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: One quick fat dab, maybe a fat cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, I can move on with my
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to sit here and roll up three
or four joints and smoke three or four
[SPEAKER_00]: joints and cough a bunch of times and
smell like herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could just smoke a big fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do love smoking flowers, but sometimes
that dab is what I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of dabs, I'm going to take a
little sip of a frosty cool beverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already got part of a dab up here on
the dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to heat up the nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to kind of do a little
tutorial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you guys how I take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to wrap this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast rolled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was interrupted by the UPS guy bringing
me a cool package that we will talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: on a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back into the show here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was about to do a dab and wrap up the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does occur to me that maybe I should
start doing the wrap up before I hit a dab
[SPEAKER_00]: so that the show does make some sense here
at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start wrapping up the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to heat up my dab nail,
my banger while I do ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we will do a dab and we will say good
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me start like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
pimps and hoes, friends and foes,
[SPEAKER_00]: smokers, growers, clone cutters,
pollen chuckers, all of you beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis enthusiasts out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to thank you once again for
listening to another episode of the Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions, corrections,
comments, or concerns, I would love to
[SPEAKER_00]: hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email address is growfromyourheart at
hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also make sure you check out the Patreon
campaign at patreon.com forward slash grow
[SPEAKER_00]: from your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else you might need will be on
my website at iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, this nail is super hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to let this cool for a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: While that cools down, I do want to thank
you once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do appreciate you dabbing with
me, you hanging out, you trusting me with
[SPEAKER_00]: all this guidance, all of this grow
advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all of the comments,
all of the feedback, all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: constructive criticism.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does mean a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does keep me going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep sending me those emails,
those messages, keep the YouTube comments
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate all of the support from
the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am of course just kind of rambling while
this does cool down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bit too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using my hand to measure the
temperature here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit too warm still.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could tell because it feels like I would
burn the shit out of myself if I touched
[SPEAKER_00]: it right now, but it is getting super
cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to move the microphone out of
my way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a big shout out to my
buddy, Purple Skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy 710 everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
