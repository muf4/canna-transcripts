[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, here we go ladies and gentlemen,
it is time for episode 495 of the Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new regular, feminized,
or auto flower seeds in your garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend Seeds Here Now,
and you can find them at www.seedsherenow
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Cherry
Fluff Full Spectrum Extract from our
[SPEAKER_00]: friends at Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of bottle wash and cherry
kush mints.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, the flavor is described as
cherry marshmallow and leather musk.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I crack the jar open, I get a hint of
cherry candies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that CBD cherry that everybody is
familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different cherry candy,
more like a cherry sweet tart,
[SPEAKER_00]: a softer cherry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that Ludens cough drop, but a
different, softer cherry candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you dab it, I believe I got more
of a chocolate covered cherry sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on the exhale, there was a bit of
sweetness that I will say may cover that
[SPEAKER_00]: marshmallow flavor they are talking about
on the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely made me nice and talkative.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should be a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back of the package, it does say
that this product contains 69.84% THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's got a great flavor,
it hits really smooth, and I think it has
[SPEAKER_00]: got a really nice buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, big thanks and big shout
out to my friends at Green Dot Labs for
[SPEAKER_00]: the delicious Cherry Fluff Full Spectrum
Extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, friends and foes,
[SPEAKER_00]: pimps and hoes, smokers and growers,
breeders and seed hoarders.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to talk about
another strain that I bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to highlight the strain Prana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to the strain review,
let's do some shout outs to a few of the
[SPEAKER_00]: folks who support the show on Patreon.

[SPEAKER_00]: Those Patreon contributions are voluntary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are donations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I noticed that you reached into your
pocket and you threw something my way for
[SPEAKER_00]: my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can't contribute to the show
financially, keep listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I want you to do is tell somebody
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say, bro, have you ever heard this Grow
From Your Heart podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell two of your friends that grow ganja.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one of them will actually subscribe
to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them will say, I don't listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not into podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if one more person subscribes and then
they hear this message and they tell one
[SPEAKER_00]: more person, it spreads like wildfire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we can get everybody growing
better cannabis, everybody on team
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get all on the same page.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll quit rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into a strain review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people may not be aware that I am the
breeder, the sole proprietor and founder
[SPEAKER_00]: of iReGenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make many regular and feminized seed
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, we're going to talk about
a cross I have made that I have called
[SPEAKER_00]: Prana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prana is a wonderful and unique little
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate and enjoy this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got a special spot in my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got a special spot in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got a special spot in my catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a really special plant to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about Prana.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I want to cover is that
Prana is not named after the fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not Parana.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Prana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prana is a word from Sanskrit and is often
used in like a yoga type setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I straight up got this by thinking I was
like, I need a yoga type word that means
[SPEAKER_00]: positive energy or upward flowing energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Prana is what I found.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it means life force or life energy or
vital force or vital energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's talk about why I chose that
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a cross of flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you already see flow, moving energy,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the other parent in this plant is,
of course, a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought the flow of upward energy,
the upward flow of energy is where my mind
[SPEAKER_00]: was going when I was trying to find a
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of looking at Hindu words and
yoga words and uplifting words.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Prana is what I came across.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really stuck with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounded right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost smelled the strain in my nose
when I read the word Prana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really works for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prana is the name of the strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's talk briefly about the parents
of Prana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should go ladies first, but let's talk
briefly about the male I used to make this
[SPEAKER_00]: cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about this plant quite often.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a male Arise plant known as King
Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a very special selected Arise plant
that is a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: To differentiate that one from my other
Arise plants in my garden, this one has
[SPEAKER_00]: been named King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the champion.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the king.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is my stud male plant that does most of
my regular breeding work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's King Solomon, a very select
Arise male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arise is a golden goat female,
which was pollinated by a daybreaker male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daybreaker is Chem D and Joseph O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the daybreaker end of this cross is
going to bring sort of a fresh tennis ball
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you open a can of tennis balls and give
it a smell, it's kind of got a sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh tennis ball aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only thing that smells like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also got sort of a fresh tires aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also hints of gas and pine and
fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what comes from the daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I bred that to the golden goat because
it was the exact opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is sweet and it is tropical and is a
little bit fruity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really found great contrast in those
two parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I bred them together and it created
Arise, which was an amazing plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a full episode on the strain
Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are interested in hearing a very
detailed strain description on Arise,
[SPEAKER_00]: check out episode 329 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go way in detail about the strain Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the male side of the cross of
Prana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an Arise male.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the female end of that cross was a
plant known as Flow and she's spelled
[SPEAKER_00]: F-L-O.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no W on the end of this Flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Flow was bred by DJ Short.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a very select cut that goes around
Colorado that is known as the Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: Flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a very beautiful and distinct
aroma to it, which really transferred very
[SPEAKER_00]: well into the Prana cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was mainly my goal was to get that
aroma into the Prana cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I acquired this Flow clone from a man
named Tom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if Tom wants to be identified
too deeply on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy Tom has a lot to do with why I am
the grower that I am today, a lot to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with why I am the cannabis person that I
am today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to give myself a label.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a person involved in cannabis and a
lot of that has to do with Tom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really had a passion for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really wanted to get involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tom really gave me a great avenue for
branching out my career in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I owe Tom a big shout out, a big thank
you right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I acquired this cut of Flow from Tom
around the year 2007 or 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time, the medical marijuana
market and the medical marijuana movement
[SPEAKER_00]: was really blossoming here in Southern
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, I was running the only
dispensary in my city.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's actually where I also ended up
meeting White Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: White Mike ended up becoming my backup
budtender and helping me out in the first
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary here in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was serving many patients this Flow
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were getting the finished product of
Flow and I found that it was helping a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also found that it helped me quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed it was great before work smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you don't want to go deal with
people first thing in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got to get up and get ready for
work and drive to work and just deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: people immediately, sometimes it's nice to
have a little bit of a buffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found that Flow was a beautiful
buffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I burned one down a Flow on the way to
work, it would just put a smile on my
[SPEAKER_00]: face.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't give a shit that I just had
to deal with everybody in my town that
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to buy herb and they all wanted it
right now and they all had a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: questions and I haven't had a chance to
handle my day yet and I didn't even care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just smile and help these people out
because I just smoke some Flow and I feel
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great social lubricant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning buzz, good smiley buzz,
but it didn't fuck me up so much that I
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't count money, that I couldn't
function properly at work, that anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: would be like, bro, you're way too stoned
to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All it did, the more I smoked it,
it just made me happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just made me give two fucks less about
anything that was wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was why I really liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed that a lot of medical patients
were really enjoying the flavor,
[SPEAKER_00]: the aroma and the effect of the Flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really enjoying the flavor,
the aroma and the effect of the Flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually I acquired a clone of the Flow
and I put it in my own garden and I
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly discovered that this plant
finished about a week or two sooner than
[SPEAKER_00]: all of my other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This cut of Flow was finishing around
eight weeks and if I got it too cold and
[SPEAKER_00]: overfed it, it would finish at the end of
seven weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was really blessed with a fast
finishing plant and I didn't even know it
[SPEAKER_00]: did that when I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just excited about the quality of
the medicine that I knew it would produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was growing this plant indoors in
multiple gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in the Metomar garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in my personal garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also ended up in our friend Steve's
outdoor garden and we all noticed that
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant could take anything you could
throw at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could take cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could take heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bugs didn't want to get on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some reason, spider mites just didn't
jump on the Flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would jump on everything around it,
but they didn't get on the Flow for some
[SPEAKER_00]: reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could take overfeeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could take underfeeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could take bending.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could take twisting and anything it
would do would just go, yeah, that was
[SPEAKER_00]: cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was such a beautiful plant to work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could take all of the abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could win all of the struggles and
still it would grow really stout and
[SPEAKER_00]: really robust and it would finish by the
end of week eight, for sure, indoors or
[SPEAKER_00]: out and then if you dried it, and cured it
properly, it gave this most wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I describe it as temple ball incense and
dirty feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost smells like you tried to hide a
bag of kush with some nog champa,
[SPEAKER_00]: is kind of what I think it smells like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really fell in love with this Flow
cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a little while, everything in my life
smelled like Flow because I was growing it
[SPEAKER_00]: in every garden that I had because it
produced well, it stunk real nice and then
[SPEAKER_00]: in the end of flower, if you grew it
indoors or outdoors, if you got it just a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit cold or maybe if you dropped
the pH a little bit, that plant would
[SPEAKER_00]: produce these beautiful orange and maroon
and purple and gold hues, late in flower
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was so beautiful and it would
change depending on your environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I saw so many great colors come from
these plants and they never got too tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They always stayed nice and stout.
[SPEAKER_00]: They always gave us a nice harvest,
whether it was indoors or out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really fell in love with the Flow and
that is why I knew that I had to breed
[SPEAKER_00]: with the Flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to put my Arise pollen on the Flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave a bunch of seeds to a bunch of my
friends and everybody came back with the
[SPEAKER_00]: same reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all said, bro, these plants kind of
smell like incense and hash and dirty feet
[SPEAKER_00]: and they all made purple short squatty
plants and I was like, I did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is exactly what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about what I
think the flavors and aromas of Flow smell
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: One time I was in Boston.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went to a store on Newbury Street.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not remember the name of that store.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy Robbie called it the Hindu store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's racist or not,
but that's what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had all kinds of Hindu stuff in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know the store I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one in every hip city.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smelled like way too much incense and
it also smelled like they were cooking
[SPEAKER_00]: some very ethnic food, but it also smelled
like somebody in there needed a fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: shower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is very much what I think Prana
smells like, which is what part of led me
[SPEAKER_00]: to the name Prana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of smells like the fucking yoga
studio in Boulder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells really nice like some incense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like maybe some, I don't know,
some good tea or something, maybe some
[SPEAKER_00]: Thai food or something like that in the
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then also it just smells like somebody
needs to wash their ass, but it is so good
[SPEAKER_00]: for some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know it sounds disgusting,
but the most disgusting cannabis aromas
[SPEAKER_00]: always translate to the best smoke is what
I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it smells like incense and armpits and
a little bit of Thai food or ethnic food,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is so wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is dominated by the power of that
incense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second smell is, I don't
know, body odor or feet or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's also like they were cooking
something ethnic in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the flavor and aroma of Prana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some phenotypes have a little bit of skunk
to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some phenotypes have a little bit of hint
of berries and feet, but most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes are going to be dominated by
that incense and body odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe like somebody is cooking
some ethnic food in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everybody who has grown this,
everybody who has sampled it, everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: who has reported back to me has used the
word unique in their descriptions of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors and aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very unique, but I think it smells
just like the Hindu shop on Newbury street
[SPEAKER_00]: in Boston, Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody, let's take a field trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's all meet up at the Hindu shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Newbury street, we'll walk in there and
go, and we'll go, oh, that's what it
[SPEAKER_00]: smells like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll high five and we'll all come
back home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll see you guys there tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk more about the buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buzz from Prana is not overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my strains are quite potent and
can kind of put some beginner smokers into
[SPEAKER_00]: a panic attack or stick you to the couch
or make you want to call your mom for
[SPEAKER_00]: help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prana is not going to do that to you in
most cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prana is going to give you a nice,
smooth head buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably going to talk too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to do some painting or do
whatever type of art you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to grab a guitar and just
strum out a few chords and write that new
[SPEAKER_00]: tune.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like most of the time, Prana is a
very uplifting and happy sort of a buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like that trait from the flow,
that happiness and that smiles and that
[SPEAKER_00]: good morning vibe and that social vibe,
I think that really translated from the
[SPEAKER_00]: flow and that came over into this cross
quite nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it puts me in a good mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really, it's kind of
energizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not too energizing to where you're
going to be wired and want to run around,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's really uplifting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll put a smile on your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like a cup of coffee and
whatever else you are taking these days to
[SPEAKER_00]: enhance your mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like that just in a bowl
form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk more about the actual growth
characteristics of this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you grow Prana, you'll know that it
doesn't get as tall as many of my other
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my crosses will get really tall in
length.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my plants will get a little bit
more bulky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prana is known to stay a little bit
shorter and get a little bit whiter and
[SPEAKER_00]: stockier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can expect some phenotypes of Prana to
potentially double in height during
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know I said it's not as tall as some
of my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will triple in height and flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one won't grow as rapidly in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That 21 day stretch is not extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will stay a little bit shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you top it or if you give it some
love, it will branch out and get quite
[SPEAKER_00]: wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant really likes being trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It likes screen of green type stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really takes well to being popped and
twist and defoliated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can take all of the abuse you want to
throw at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can expect many phenotypes of Prana to
finish at the end of week eight,
[SPEAKER_00]: but some may take longer because King
Solomon is a longer finishing plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Arise can go nine or 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that trait does carry to some
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be outliers that will finish in
the middle of week seven and the start of
[SPEAKER_00]: week eight, but you can count on some end
of week eighters and end of week nine
[SPEAKER_00]: plants for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there will be outliers both directions
because the parents of these are vastly
[SPEAKER_00]: different flowering times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I have found when I've grown a
lot of these plants is the thinner-leaved
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes are obviously the Arise
dominant plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to take longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: When those plants are getting taller and
thinner, those are obviously going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: your longer flowering phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The short one with the really wide leaves,
it gets maroon right up the pedials really
[SPEAKER_00]: early.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the early finishing phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically the wider leaves, the earlier
this plant is going to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prana is basically an easy plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's one of my most simple plants to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I recommend her for beginners.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is in my top three for recommendations
for beginner growers, as well as my top
[SPEAKER_00]: three for my outdoor strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want outdoor stuff or if you're
a new grower, Prana is one of the strains
[SPEAKER_00]: to grab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one of my recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is fairly easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: She could take abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's quite vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: She bounces back if you do mess her up.
[SPEAKER_00]: She can take feeding mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: She grows very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'll give you a generous harvest,
even if you do have some problems with her
[SPEAKER_00]: and the outcome is always quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people think that a plant that is
very forgiving may not be high quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not true with this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: She will still put out high quality,
even if you do have a couple of small
[SPEAKER_00]: mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: She really does like it if you spread her
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: She likes to become a wide plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could trellis her.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could screen her out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use a tomato cage and stretch it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: She really likes that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: She really enjoys being cleaned up on the
bottoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take all that crap up off the
bottom, the plant will grow up toward the
[SPEAKER_00]: top and really give you a lot better,
more dense top buds if you clean up the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great thing I should mention about
Prana is she is very resistant to mold and
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never had bud rot in a Prana plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen powdery mildew on a Prana
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also mentioned earlier that the spider
mites tend to stay away from the flow and
[SPEAKER_00]: the Prana.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something about that dirty feet,
that nogchampa sort of a smell that the
[SPEAKER_00]: spider mites just go, bro, I don't even
want to go over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may find that the spider mites
avoid your Prana plants if you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: other plants with spider mites on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not encouraging you to get mites to
try it, but it's something you may
[SPEAKER_00]: discover.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the best things about Prana,
which I mentioned earlier is she is an
[SPEAKER_00]: early finisher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those phenotypes will be done at
week eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is always nice to get a crop down,
especially if you're growing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your crop is harvested and indoors and
safe and secure while everybody else still
[SPEAKER_00]: has two weeks to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yours is dried and cured and ready for
market while everybody else still has time
[SPEAKER_00]: to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that puts you ahead of the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also puts you ahead of the thieves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It puts you ahead of the frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It puts you ahead of potential problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting a crop down, dried and secured
earlier than everybody else is a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you come to one of the best traits of
Prana is when you smoke it, it is very
[SPEAKER_00]: satisfying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it brings a beautiful buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't help but just sit there and
smile and enjoy how stoned you are and how
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect that uplifting, goofy buzz is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit more about
growing this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets bushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can expect it to double in height by
the time it is done flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may need some supports because you're
going to get fat, chunky buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have stout plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should have big fat branches,
but hopefully those buds are huge and you
[SPEAKER_00]: need some sort of support.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plan on trellising, plan on tomato
cages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't like a bunch of stakes in
the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you get those wooden stakes and you
run them a couple of times in your grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you crack them open, you'll see they're
just filled with crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's possibly mold in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had any bugs, those bugs laid eggs
inside of those sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend getting away from the
wooden stakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you insist on using stakes in your
grow, I recommend the green or red
[SPEAKER_00]: washable and replaceable stakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you could clean them and make
sure they're not getting mold inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can spray them down with a pesticide,
make sure they don't have bugs all over
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I prefer not to use stakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're dangerous and there are much more
efficient methods, but you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: need some sort of support for these big
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you'll see some beautiful
colorful plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about how to bring out some
of those colors, temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Late in flower, get it a little bit cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will really bring out the color of
these prana plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that comes from DJ Short's Flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That flow really turns beautiful colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get them cold late in flower,
you will really bring out those purples
[SPEAKER_00]: and reds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also some kelp products will bring out the
colors and the kelp products also seem to
[SPEAKER_00]: enhance that funky, stank aroma from this
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk more about feeding prana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prana likes to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can feed the shit out of your prana
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flow parent is a semi heavy feeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: The golden goat on the other side of the
parental line is a very heavy feeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of these phenotypes will be able to
eat very high PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not encouraging you to burn the plants
from the very beginning, but start pushing
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend pushing them until you start
seeing the leaf tips burn just a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can either stick with that
much nutrient or dial it back just a
[SPEAKER_00]: little.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really feel like prana can take a
heavy feeding if you are careful and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know what you're giving her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind these plants do finish
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to boost them up with a
lot of nutrients, you have to save
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself plenty of time for flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she can be a heavy feeder, but don't
forget to schedule your flush early
[SPEAKER_00]: because these plants may finish earlier
than you're anticipating and they may be
[SPEAKER_00]: done earlier than the rest of the plants
in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall she is a heavy feeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: She can take the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: She can take the potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: She could take the phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: She may need some Kalmag.
[SPEAKER_00]: She does have golden goat in her genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody that messes with golden goat knows
that plant likes to get nutrient deficient
[SPEAKER_00]: really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So prana may need some extra nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to her.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have also noticed that you can lower the
pH of prana and she will respond very
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lower pH will usually bring out some
aromas and some different funks and some
[SPEAKER_00]: cool colors in many phenotypes of prana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got to keep in mind that some
of these things are phenotype dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also these things are dependent on your
environment, your room, your feed,
[SPEAKER_00]: your equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all generalizations on things I
have seen in my rooms and in my tester
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms from growing large populations of
these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your setup may be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about specific phenotypes in
just a minute, but from most of what I've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen, this is the easiest plant to grow in
my lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the seeds I have put out are for
more advanced growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some beginner growers may have some
struggles figuring out what's going on
[SPEAKER_00]: with some of my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get tall really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get out of hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: People may panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is very easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most phenotypes of prana are going to be
very forgiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do make a mistake, the plants
will bounce right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another great thing is they don't take
a real long time to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do make a mistake, they're
almost done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to start another crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to try again and you don't get too
far behind schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think these plants will do great in an
indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they do great in most outdoor
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say these plants are going to grow
great everywhere, but I've gotten good
[SPEAKER_00]: reports of them from both coasts and
almost everywhere in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew well outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They finished on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They beat the frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't get any mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't get many bug problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that seems to be a good report for
outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work wonderfully in indoor grow
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bred them in an indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tested them in many indoor
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work well under HID lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work well under LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen beautiful results under ceramic
metal halides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're great plants in
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is a great plant for a
beginner grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really think that an advanced grower
will find some beautiful phenotypes and
[SPEAKER_00]: really be able to push this plant to a
really great level without spending nine,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 or 11 weeks flowering something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll still reach great potential with
prana plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think that King Solomon put a lot
of vigor and a lot of potency into this
[SPEAKER_00]: cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I really think that the flow
brings that intense, unique aroma,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the combination still gives it
potential to be first-class top shelf
[SPEAKER_00]: connoisseur smoke, even if it finishes
around week seven, eight or nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very diverse, very versatile
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the consumers at the end will
really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that patients really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about some of the phenotypes to
look for before we start wrapping up this
[SPEAKER_00]: long, rambly episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few phenotypes that I have
noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is one that is obviously the flow
dominant phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks just like you're growing flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of has a flow blueberry sort of
aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of dark in color.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've grown flow at all, it is very
obvious, the flow dominant phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then of course there is the Arise dominant
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is skinnier, and that phenotype
absolutely takes longer than the flow
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: In comparison, the flow dominant phenotype
will stay shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will stay wider.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will stay more squat, and it will have
thicker branching on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom branches will be more stout.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Arise dominant phenotype will grow
taller more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will have the branching, but it won't
have as many nodes on the branching,
[SPEAKER_00]: if that makes any sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the nodes will come off, but they won't
have as many sub-branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks more like a switch than a bush,
if that makes any sense to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that you'd go get for grandma to
whip your ass with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flow dominant phenotype will not work
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's more like swinging a menorah at
somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too many branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Arise dominant phenotype, I guess you
could say is more like a fishing pole in
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison to the menorah compared to the
flow dominant phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's move forward to a couple of more
phenotypes you may see.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is one that I call the flow OG
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is nothing like the flow OG that's
released by another breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just see traits of flow, and then I see
Joseph OG and Kim D in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stays short.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stays squat, but it makes really wide
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves on this one get really,
really wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: That comes from the daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the crosses I made with daybreaker
have this trait where the leaves are
[SPEAKER_00]: really wide, and they like to droop and
hang down.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how happy that plant is,
those leaves won't go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are so big that the plant struggles
to keep them up, but that is just a trait
[SPEAKER_00]: that comes from the daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that in the flow and the OG dominant
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the one that is really purple,
really squat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, that one is the smallest of
the yielders.
[SPEAKER_00]: She puts out super nice frosty golf balls
that are covered in resin, but
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately, she doesn't give you a lot
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll still get a good yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get a nice harvest, but there is a
better harvest in that pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is another phenotype that I've
seen quite a bit, and I call her the
[SPEAKER_00]: float.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is flow and golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the purple coloring of the flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that funky aroma of the flow,
but it grows kind of tall, and it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very distinct golden goat leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown golden goat for several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see those leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The larger leaves get this crinkle right
where they all come out of the pedial.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this weird crinkle that the golden
goat leaves do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see that in the float phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the purple pedials.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets a little bit purple and it gets
that smell, but then it gets those golden
[SPEAKER_00]: goat leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not my favorite phenotype,
but the float phenotype is very desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got many great traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little head racy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little extra talkative,
but it does give you very nice harvests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to talk about my favorite
phenotype that I have found that comes
[SPEAKER_00]: very commonly in a pack of prana seeds,
but before I do that, I want to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a reminder or a public service
announcement, or I don't even know what
[SPEAKER_00]: it's called, but I talk about phenotypes
on this show a lot, and then I will get
[SPEAKER_00]: emails from people showing me pictures of
their plant saying, hey, is this the float
[SPEAKER_00]: or is this the flow OG phenotype or is
this the flow dominant or the arise
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant phenotype?
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are really curious about which
phenotype they've got compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: labels I have assigned by seeing a lot of
different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really cool that you want to
know which phenotype you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I have, can I call this the flow
dominant or can I call this the arise
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant phenotype?
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're doing a phenohunt,
don't worry so much about the plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worry more about the plants that you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're the grower, focus on the plants
that grow the best in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one performed the best out of that
pack of seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: So take careful notes of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one grew the best?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one recovered the best from
problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one gave me problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then become the smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you smoke it, which phenotype tasted
the best?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which phenotype gave you the best buzz?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which phenotype was your best overall when
you smoked it?
[SPEAKER_00]: But try to do these two tests as two
separate entities.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grower and the smoker need to separate
themselves when you're doing a phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have grown it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got notes from the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know which plant worked the best in
your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You knew which plant was a pain in the ass
that you really don't want to grow again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've still got clones of all of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You dry it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then take notes on each phenotype as you
smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find which one is your favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be one that tastes better.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be one that gets you more stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's probably one that you find is
your favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you may have to smoke all of them
multiple times in multiple situations to
[SPEAKER_00]: realize which one really stands out to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or perhaps you're growing for somebody
else's medical needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we've got to have them consume
this product and see which one works best
[SPEAKER_00]: for their medical needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once you've got plenty
[SPEAKER_00]: of data from the person who is going to
consume the smoke, and now you can make a
[SPEAKER_00]: decision based on the product and the
plant and the phenotype that is
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate for you instead of trying to
find the phenotypes that I have told you
[SPEAKER_00]: are my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We probably like very similar things,
but we probably like very different things
[SPEAKER_00]: at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We both like food, but you don't want me
deciding your next three meals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may nail it and decide three perfect
meals for you, or I may frustrate you and
[SPEAKER_00]: you may have to eat the worst shit in your
opinion for the next three meals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't focus too much on the phenotypes
that I point out and that I say I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the phenotype that works best for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I tell you what phenotypes I
have seen and what you can expect is just
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of give you an idea of what to
look for and what to expect when you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you something to visualize,
some sort of landmark, some sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: base, some sort of a jumping point,
something to relate to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love and appreciate how much you trust
me and how much you want to take my
[SPEAKER_00]: advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But find the phenotypes and the plants
that work best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make you happy, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you've got seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you're growing for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you make the decisions that make
you happy in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the phenotype that I
would select for myself if I were growing
[SPEAKER_00]: a pack of prana seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mainly like this phenotype because of
the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has got that perfect incense and kind
of maybe someone's cooking some Indian
[SPEAKER_00]: food or some Thai food or something in the
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's got just that perfect aroma
of a little bit of foot and ass to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the combination is deliciously
disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can tell that's what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: About six weeks into the flowering cycle,
you'll smell it and you'll go,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's the incense and dirty feet that he
was talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think the Thai food or the
Indian food, that spicy part, that doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really come in until the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you smell incense and feet,
I think you are on pace to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype I am talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one has big leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are not the big leaves that come
from the Oji Kush phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're big, but they are also long and
fingery.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very serrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that comes, so the big trait comes
from the daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: The serrations come from the golden goat
and the basic leaf shape that I'm talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about comes from the flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are kind of big leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very long and fingery and very
serrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes this one has purple petioles and
the leaves will start to purple up later
[SPEAKER_00]: in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really good indicator that you
have got my favorite phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is kind of short and she grows kind of
wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't talk this plant, it will turn
into a Christmas tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be shaped just like a Christmas
tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have very far nodal spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll have a little bit of branch and
you'll have a node and then maybe two
[SPEAKER_00]: finger spaces and then another node and
two finger spaces and more nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a lot of node branching out of
this phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is also very leafy is one thing I've
noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This phenotype is leafier than most of the
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it looks really bushy, if it's kind of
stout, kind of purpley, kind of wide,
[SPEAKER_00]: you are probably on pace to have the
phenotype that I am looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite phenotype doesn't make a
really ridiculous giant top cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a kind of a menorah shape to it
with one bud that sticks up a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it doesn't have that extreme dominant
glory bud like a lot of strains will make.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do not top it, it will just kind of
grow into a Christmas tree with the
[SPEAKER_00]: branches below it just just a little bit
lower and the branches below that just a
[SPEAKER_00]: little lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get that extreme different layer
of growth from different branches like you
[SPEAKER_00]: do a lot of other strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep using the word menorah because I
see everything wanting to grow to the same
[SPEAKER_00]: height.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you see a menorah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got eight tops that are all the
same height.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sort of what this strain will do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the middle, you'll have one that
gets just a little bit taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's got a lot of light and a lot of
nutrients and it's doing really well,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes it grows into this beautiful
Christmas tree shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's got a really beautiful
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for only taking eight weeks to flower,
I really think this phenotype gives very
[SPEAKER_00]: generous harvest weights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great plant to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said a moment ago, don't focus
too much on the phenotypes I talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the phenotype that works best for you
in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now one hint that I can give you,
the skunkier and fuelier phenotypes are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be your lower yielding phenotypes
and your insane sensey kind of Thai food,
[SPEAKER_00]: Indian food scented phenotypes are going
to be your more generously yielding
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost all phenotypes of this plant will
give you pretty generous harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, almost all phenotypes of this plant
are going to give you that smiley,
[SPEAKER_00]: happy, shake everybody's hand,
high five everybody, skip through the day
[SPEAKER_00]: without a care kind of a buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sticking to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my breakdown of my strain prana.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: To arise, I hope you enjoyed my strain
report.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I put these episodes out,
I start getting emails from people asking,
[SPEAKER_00]: where can I get a pack of prana seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The easiest way to find a pack of prana
seeds is to find me at the Endo Expo in
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver, Colorado on January 25th and 26th.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be at booth 533.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't make it to the Endo Expo,
you can always visit seedsherenow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's obviously at www.seedsherenow
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there is the Hella Dank Seed
Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then don't forget about our friends,
Oregon Elite Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, OregonEliteSeeds.com.

[SPEAKER_01]: They won't help you through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only a chance you get when you're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, don't smile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's to be wonderful, your brother,
like a blind man in the dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your phone points just to score.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fly too high or wax my mind, and you'll
fall down to your knees.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I ask from you, my friend,
is that you have nothing from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dreams, well, they're like a thousand
little dreams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eagles steadfast like mountains in our
brains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those of us who let no one be swallowed,
left here to die.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not look to the sky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will not rain for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not look too strange, as they won't
help you through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only a chance you get when you're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: don't smile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's to be wonderful, your brother,

Oh, don't smile.

help you through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only a chance you get when you're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, don't smile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's to be wonderful, your brother,
like a blind man in the dark.
Blind man in the dark.
Blind man in the dark.
