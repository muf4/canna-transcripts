time for episode 328 of the grow from your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart podcast thanks again for joining me
you know I like to start the show off by
[SPEAKER_00]: letting you know what I'm dabbing today
I'm smoking star dog ambrosia batter from
[SPEAKER_00]: our friends at apothecary farms if you
know me you know I love the star dog I
[SPEAKER_00]: love the aroma I love the flavor I love
the high I love the way it grows and of
[SPEAKER_00]: course I love taking pictures of star dog
she's a very photogenic strain so today
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking dabs of star dog ambrosia
batter from our friends at apothecary now
[SPEAKER_00]: if you've been following the show lately
you've probably caught the episodes about
[SPEAKER_00]: determining ripeness of your cannabis
plants then we did an episode about
[SPEAKER_00]: flushing your plants then we did an
episode about harvesting then we did an
[SPEAKER_00]: episode about drying and curing your
cannabis plants then we did an episode
[SPEAKER_00]: about trimming now it is time to clean up
the grow room and get restarted for the
[SPEAKER_00]: next cycle let's talk a little bit about
after harvest cleaning it sounds pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: basic but there are a few things you may
overlook now if you had bugs or powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew you may want to step up your
cleaning product you may want to step up
[SPEAKER_00]: your cleaning regimen but if you didn't
have any bugs or any issues I think a
[SPEAKER_00]: light bleach and water solution should
work or maybe you might want to get
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself some phyzan and use 15 to 20 mils
of phyzan per gallon of water use that to
[SPEAKER_00]: clean up your whole grow either way
whatever product you use let's clean
[SPEAKER_00]: everything let's clean the walls wipe down
every inch of every wall start at one
[SPEAKER_00]: section at the top and just work your way
down and to the right and then just keep
[SPEAKER_00]: going until you've covered every inch of
that grow room also if you can reach scrub
[SPEAKER_00]: the ceiling if you can't reach find me I
can probably reach if not get a ladder
[SPEAKER_00]: scrub the ceiling let's clean it with
either bleach and hot water or phyzan and
[SPEAKER_00]: hot water and just get anything off of
there that may be hiding that we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want in that grow room maybe you've got a
spider mite up there chilling out maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a little bit of powdery mildew
spore that you don't know about maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a piece of pollen up there that
you don't know about let's clean
[SPEAKER_00]: everything just to be sure so clean the
walls clean the ceiling clean your light
[SPEAKER_00]: reflectors clean the lights the top of the
lights they're probably dusty up on top
[SPEAKER_00]: the reflectors they're dusty on the inside
clean those things take this opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: while the room is empty and clean
everything you guys so take the light
[SPEAKER_00]: reflectors down if you think they need
some cleaning clean them hang them back up
[SPEAKER_00]: clean your fans take the fans off of the
wall take the little grate off the front
[SPEAKER_00]: unscrew the little thing that holds the
blades on take the blades off clean the
[SPEAKER_00]: blades I know they're dirty fans get
disgusting the grate on the back is filled
[SPEAKER_00]: with muck and hair and just weird random
gunk that I can't even tell you what it is
[SPEAKER_00]: clean that shit out of there you're
probably going to be disgusted that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: been blowing that shit around in your grow
clean your fans while you're cleaning the
[SPEAKER_00]: fans look at anything that moves air or
blows air look at the air return on your
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidifier that things pulling in a
bunch of water and a bunch of air and then
[SPEAKER_00]: it's blowing air back out does that filter
need to be changed does that dehumidifier
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be cleaned off is the water line
that's draining water out of your
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidifier is it gunky does it need to
be cleaned is the reservoir that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: draining your dehumidifier water into
starting to develop slime and algae if so
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to clean that stay on top of
those sort of things so clean the walls
[SPEAKER_00]: clean the whites clean the fans clean your
dehumidifier dust everything the top of
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is dusty the top of everything
is funky you've been spraying pesticides
[SPEAKER_00]: in there imagine you sprayed some sticky
pesticide like azimax in there then it got
[SPEAKER_00]: dusty it's just sticking to the azimax
it's funky it's gross clean everything
[SPEAKER_00]: wipe it and dust the top of everything
clean your hydro tables if you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: tables in the room clean them if you've
got trays and you can take them outside
[SPEAKER_00]: take them outside spray them down with the
hose if you've got a power washer hit them
[SPEAKER_00]: with the power washer if those tables are
real dirty scrub them down with some
[SPEAKER_00]: phyzan scrub them down with some bleach
make sure you rinse them out real good and
[SPEAKER_00]: just get them real clean you guys the
phyzan is going to foam up be prepared for
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're going to make foam with phyzan
and make sure you clean everything out
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're done using cleaning products
clean out your tables and reservoirs
[SPEAKER_00]: really well if you use a cleaning product
or rinse the shit out of those hydro
[SPEAKER_00]: tables rinse the shit out of all your
tubing and all of your lines clean that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff so that it's not clogged and so
there's no algae in there here's something
[SPEAKER_00]: people don't pay enough attention to clean
the floor yes i know we just walk on the
[SPEAKER_00]: floor all day right sweep it mop it clean
it up if you've got some sort of poly film
[SPEAKER_00]: or panda film on the floor some sort of
subfloor does it need to be replaced are
[SPEAKER_00]: there holes in it has your poly or your
panda film started stretching and getting
[SPEAKER_00]: holes from the staples do you need to duct
tape some spots check that kind of stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: out clean your floors everything lands on
the floor the floor is gross clean it up
[SPEAKER_00]: also here's something i should mention if
you've got light reflectors with glass on
[SPEAKER_00]: them so that they're air cooled clean that
glass take that glass out wipe that shit
[SPEAKER_00]: down with some windex let it dry and put
it back clean the reflector glass also
[SPEAKER_00]: clean all of your air conditioner filters
check them make sure they are clean if you
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got ducting anywhere check your
ducting make sure the ducting isn't bent
[SPEAKER_00]: in any weird places make sure there are no
clogs make sure all of your duct is
[SPEAKER_00]: secured make sure it's duct taped or
clamped somewhere so that the air you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to move away from the grow doesn't
accidentally end up being blown right
[SPEAKER_00]: where you don't need it if you've got a
leak that air is just going to come flying
[SPEAKER_00]: out of there you may just be moving the
heat from the light right back into the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room then your air conditioner has to
work harder and you can't figure out why
[SPEAKER_00]: the room isn't cooling down and it gets
frustrating so check all of your ducting
[SPEAKER_00]: check your carbon filter is that carbon
filter still filtering can you smell the
[SPEAKER_00]: herb outside when you grow did anybody
mention that your harvest stunk really
[SPEAKER_00]: badly how long have you had that carbon
filter did you write it down you should
[SPEAKER_00]: know when that carbon filter needs to be
replaced a lot of the brands say they will
[SPEAKER_00]: last two years i never believe in that
i've never had a carbon filter last two
[SPEAKER_00]: years also that carbon filter cover maybe
you're going to leave that filter there
[SPEAKER_00]: for two years and it's got that little
dust cover on it take that ugly thing off
[SPEAKER_00]: throw it in the washer with some oxy clean
and clean that thing nobody wants to see
[SPEAKER_00]: your pictures of your black and gray
carbon filter dust cover that is gross
[SPEAKER_00]: also you guys get in there and clean out
the reservoir if you've got a reservoir
[SPEAKER_00]: that you mix your nutrients in or that you
use as part of your hydro system that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're pumping your nutrients from right
to your plants clean that reservoir why
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't you want to clean fresh start you
don't want biofilm and funk in there
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's going directly to your
plants also clean all of the tubing i've
[SPEAKER_00]: already said that once but clean it all
because all that gunk will end up into
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants another thing we should
remember to clean is the emitters if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a hydro system with some
sprayers or emitters or sprinklers at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of a line make sure you pop those
emitters off and clean them they like to
[SPEAKER_00]: get filled with some gunky funk now is the
perfect opportunity to take all those off
[SPEAKER_00]: and clean them up real well another really
important thing we can do while we've got
[SPEAKER_00]: the room taken down we can decide if we
need to replace any bulbs how long have
[SPEAKER_00]: your bulbs been in the grow depending on
what type of lighting you're using it may
[SPEAKER_00]: be time to swap out some bulbs when bulbs
get old they still draw the same amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity but they do not put out the
same amount of light so you're paying for
[SPEAKER_00]: that electricity and it is not making it
to your plants so check your bulbs and see
[SPEAKER_00]: if they need to be replaced a good way to
find out if they need to be replaced is to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a lumen meter a lumen meter will
measure how much light is coming from your
[SPEAKER_00]: bulb if your bulb is putting out less than
75 or 80 percent of its maximum output it
[SPEAKER_00]: is time to replace it now how do you know
what the maximum output of that bulb is?
[SPEAKER_00]: the way to find that out is to buy a brand
new bulb put the bulb in your reflector
[SPEAKER_00]: and turn it on then you've got to wait a
few minutes and let that bulb get to its
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum brightness it takes a little while
for the bulbs to heat up and get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: right spectrum and get all the way bright
once it's bright and all the way heated up
[SPEAKER_00]: go about 12 to 18 inches from that bulb
and measure what the lumens are right
[SPEAKER_00]: there and write it down write down the
date and the amount of lumens then check
[SPEAKER_00]: it now when you're cleaning the room go
the same distance away with that lumen
[SPEAKER_00]: meter and see how many lumens are popping
up if you're not satisfied with the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of power you're getting out of that bulb
it is time to replace it if you feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: you're paying for electricity that is not
making it to your plants it is time to
[SPEAKER_00]: replace your bulb lumen meters may be
expensive but a lot of times the grow shop
[SPEAKER_00]: will let you borrow one because they know
that if your bulbs are bad you're probably
[SPEAKER_00]: just gonna come buy more bulbs when you
return the lumen meter so ask them at the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow store they may have one available
that you can borrow alright guys most of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cleaning stuff should be fairly
obvious clean the shit out of everything
[SPEAKER_00]: scrub everything if you're gonna put
plants in anything that had a cleaner in
[SPEAKER_00]: it make sure you get that cleaner out
replace the bulbs replace the filters some
[SPEAKER_00]: other things we may not remember to think
about are check and reset your timers and
[SPEAKER_00]: all of your programs if you've got your
lights on a certain schedule fix that
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule if you've got your co2 or your
auto watering on a schedule make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: correct that schedule before you put new
plants in here did daylight savings time
[SPEAKER_00]: happen check that is the timer on the
right time is your timer on the right day
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of the controllers have a day that
you can set is it monday tuesday or
[SPEAKER_00]: wednesday is it the proper day do you have
am and pm set properly make sure you check
[SPEAKER_00]: out all of your controllers before you put
plants in there and you accidentally
[SPEAKER_00]: flower them way too early also check out
all of your co2 controls another thing i
[SPEAKER_00]: like to do at this point in time is
calibrate all of my pens and meters i like
[SPEAKER_00]: to calibrate my ph pen i like to make sure
that my ec meter is working properly these
[SPEAKER_00]: are all things that you should check on
between harvests i like to calibrate my
[SPEAKER_00]: meters about once every two weeks to tell
you the truth probably every 10 days i
[SPEAKER_00]: just like to check on them and make sure
that those things are accurate another
[SPEAKER_00]: thing you should have a fire extinguisher
near your grow check on that look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: little gauge on there make sure it's in
the green if your fire extinguisher gauge
[SPEAKER_00]: is not in the green either buy a new one
or take it to the fire department and have
[SPEAKER_00]: it refilled correctly i really hope you
don't have to use that fire extinguisher
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you need it i really want it to
work for you also check the batteries in
[SPEAKER_00]: your smoke alarm yes i said smoke alarm
your grow should have a smoke alarm you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to burn down the house because
something went wrong in the grow room and
[SPEAKER_00]: you did not have a smoke detector and a
fire extinguisher so be a responsible
[SPEAKER_00]: grower make sure that the safety
precautions are in place now since we're
[SPEAKER_00]: checking on the fire extinguisher and the
smoke alarm it is a good time to check on
[SPEAKER_00]: your respirator are you using a respirator
to apply pesticides i really hope you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using something to keep yourself safe if
you're using a respirator now is the time
[SPEAKER_00]: to check those cartridges how long have
they been on there is it time to replace
[SPEAKER_00]: them is that respirator clean maybe it's
time to watch a google video and learn how
[SPEAKER_00]: to properly clean and take care of your
respirator that thing is going to save
[SPEAKER_00]: your life over time take care of that also
it's a good time to replace your gloves do
[SPEAKER_00]: you need more nitrile gloves do you need
more type x suits now is a really good
[SPEAKER_00]: time to make a list and go to the grow
store and stock up on those types of items
[SPEAKER_00]: all right so we've got the grow room nice
and clean we have checked all of our
[SPEAKER_00]: safety precautions we've refilled all of
the necessary supplies now is a good time
[SPEAKER_00]: to do a quick inventory of your pesticides
and nutrients and any accessories you
[SPEAKER_00]: think you may need if you're going to need
pesticides or nutrients start ordering
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff now so that when you move your
plants back into the room you have got all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the nutrients and all the supplies you
need so that you don't miss a day of the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth cycle so we've got everything
cleaned up we've checked out all of our
[SPEAKER_00]: safety equipment we've restocked all of
our personal protective equipment we've
[SPEAKER_00]: reordered all of our nutrients now if we
didn't have any problems with pests or
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew it is time to start running
that room and get it prepared for the next
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle now if you did have pests or
problems there are a couple of more steps
[SPEAKER_00]: that we need to take we need to clean this
room thoroughly we need to spray it with
[SPEAKER_00]: some products we might want to go a little
harder with the bleach water we might want
[SPEAKER_00]: to go a little harder with some phyzan you
might want to get a product called procure
[SPEAKER_00]: if you had powdery mildew you're going to
want to spray something to get rid of the
[SPEAKER_00]: spores in that room if you had bugs I
would recommend spraying some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide through the entire room just mix
up your pesticide sprayer your pump
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayer if you don't have one go get one
from Lowe's get a good one get a deck
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayer that can handle bleach because
you're going to be putting some chemicals
[SPEAKER_00]: in here they're not that expensive you
just need one that holds about a gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe two gallons of water fill it up with
water put your cleaning product in there
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's phyzan whether it's procure
whether it's a bunch of bleach maybe you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to use granulated sulfur if you had a
PM issue mix that up spray the shit out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire room this is your best
opportunity to spray everything and
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminate your problem there are no plants
in there so you can use products that you
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't spray when you've got plants in
there so get in there and clean the shit
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the room I would start with the
normal cleaning I recommended take
[SPEAKER_00]: everything down and clean it then put it
back up then set up the room and before
[SPEAKER_00]: you put the plants in there go in there
with this extra hard commando cleaning
[SPEAKER_00]: spray and go really hard you guys you got
to get all of the bugs out of there or
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just going to bring plants in there
and they're going to get bugs or they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get PM and you're going to have
another struggling harvest and nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: likes to struggle through a harvest so now
we've taken everything apart we've cleaned
[SPEAKER_00]: the shit out of the room we've replaced
the bulbs we've replaced all of our
[SPEAKER_00]: filters we have calibrated all of our
equipment we've got new protective
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment we have tested our safety
equipment we've put the room back together
[SPEAKER_00]: we've gone in there and done another final
spray maybe we hit it with phyzan maybe we
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayed procure on everything to try to
get rid of our problems maybe we just
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayed bleach water real hot bleach water
in there maybe we went in there with some
[SPEAKER_00]: h2o2 that would work really well also but
if you use any type of products like that
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys make sure you wear personal
protective equipment some goggles and a
[SPEAKER_00]: respirator you don't want to spray bleach
you don't want to spray h2o2 you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to spray phyzan without some sort of
protective equipment that should be
[SPEAKER_00]: terrible for your eyes terrible for your
skin please take care of yourself and if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using a sprayer to spray anything
please use some sort of respiratory
[SPEAKER_00]: protection please now once the room is put
back together here is something I suggest
[SPEAKER_00]: I would turn on the lights I would turn on
your blowers I would turn on the fans I
[SPEAKER_00]: would turn on the air conditioner and I
would let everything run for a few minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: and I would stand in the room and pay
attention is there anything wrong is there
[SPEAKER_00]: anything you could dial in is there
anything you could adjust do it while
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in there then go outside and walk
around your grow space if your grow is at
[SPEAKER_00]: your house just go walk around the house
just go pick up trash around the house or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever and see if you can identify any
light leaks do you see light coming out of
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow room if you see light coming out
there is light going in we do not want and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot have light leaks in our grow room
so walk around the house walk around the
[SPEAKER_00]: perimeter identify any possible light
leaks also listen do you hear the blowers
[SPEAKER_00]: do you hear the fans do you hear your air
conditioner is anything outside making it
[SPEAKER_00]: obvious that you're running a grow in that
house this is a good time to discover that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got light leaks or that we've got
noisy equipment so that we don't get
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves in trouble you do not want to
attract law enforcement it may be legal
[SPEAKER_00]: where you grow it is legal where I grow I
am still stealth because you know who's
[SPEAKER_00]: worse than law enforcement fucking thieves
you don't want people to know you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow in your house because somebody may
come and take your crop from you that is a
[SPEAKER_00]: real thing keep that in mind you have to
be careful even in a legal state keep your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow stealth so walk around outside look
let us in smell pay attention see if
[SPEAKER_00]: anything is going wrong outside once
you're sure that everything is fine
[SPEAKER_00]: outside that's when you can go back in the
grow room turn off the lights in the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room and stand in there for about 10
minutes let your eyes adjust now is the
[SPEAKER_00]: time to find out if any light is leaking
into the grow now is the time to find out
[SPEAKER_00]: if the sunshine from outside is coming
through your duct for your vented hoods
[SPEAKER_00]: right into your light reflectors into your
grow room and shining light on your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: during a dark period now is the time to
find that out now the catch to these last
[SPEAKER_00]: two things you're only gonna be able to
tell if you have a light leak outside if
[SPEAKER_00]: you go walk around the house and it's dark
outside the only way you can tell if you
[SPEAKER_00]: have a light leak inside is if it's light
outside and you go in the grow room and
[SPEAKER_00]: you turn off the lights on the inside of
the grow room so you're gonna have to find
[SPEAKER_00]: the time of day to do that you're gonna
have to do some investigating and some
[SPEAKER_00]: inspecting but these are very important
details to not overlook make sure your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room is light proof make sure there's
not a lot of noise coming out of there and
[SPEAKER_00]: also find out if you've got too much aroma
and correct it if you do you don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: attract attention that you don't need once
you've been growing for a while or if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're somebody who is looking for grows
so say myself i've been growing for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time when i used to go walk my dog in my
neighborhood i would always discover a new
[SPEAKER_00]: grow i would go a different route i'd go
two blocks that way three blocks that way
[SPEAKER_00]: a block that way and then i'd come back
and then the next day i'd just do a
[SPEAKER_00]: different pattern i would always find a
new grow about once a week because i know
[SPEAKER_00]: what i'm looking for listening for and
smelling for i know the details i know the
[SPEAKER_00]: clues if i hear your weird blower at three
in the morning going from your basement
[SPEAKER_00]: window chances are you got to grow in
there if you've got an air conditioner in
[SPEAKER_00]: your basement window in the middle of
winter chances are there's a grow in there
[SPEAKER_00]: if you've got one window by the basement
that has no snow and the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard is snowy there's a grow in there
if there's one spot on your roof above one
[SPEAKER_00]: bedroom that there's no snow on it there's
a grow in there there are really easy
[SPEAKER_00]: signs that give it away so pay attention
you guys because if i can see it law
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement can see it and so can the
thieves so be careful with your grow try
[SPEAKER_00]: to stay stealth even in legal states
there's no reason to brag there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: reason to set bait alright podcast world i
feel like that is a pretty good clean and
[SPEAKER_00]: reset episode hopefully i mentioned some
details that you would have overlooked
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully i rescued you through a couple
of pitfalls now you don't have to make
[SPEAKER_00]: those mistakes hopefully everything was
well in your grow and you don't have any
[SPEAKER_00]: problems hopefully you don't have anything
funky to deal with also now that the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: is nice and clean let's fucking keep it
clean let's get in there with a mop and a
[SPEAKER_00]: broom every day if we need to and mop and
sweep that bitch let's get in there with a
[SPEAKER_00]: shop vac and suck out you know that shit
in the corner you've been looking at get
[SPEAKER_00]: the fucking shop vac and back that out
it's not going to shop back itself and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a great place for a spider mite to
hang out that's a great place for some
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids to hang out and breed that's a
great place for some powdery mildew to
[SPEAKER_00]: start that is just a vector for problems
so now that you've got it nice and clean
[SPEAKER_00]: don't be lazy get in there and clean it as
often as you
[SPEAKER_00]: need anything that you're low on go get
yourself organized also get a notebook and
[SPEAKER_00]: start making detailed notes start
