[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, what's up podcast world?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 312.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start these episodes
off by letting you know what I'm smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I'm taking dabs of Apollo 13 live
batter from our friends at Apothecary
[SPEAKER_00]: Farms in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, this concentrate smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always thought Apollo 13 had sort of a
funky smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they made it into a concentrate,
it definitely brought out that funky
[SPEAKER_00]: smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sort of like a rotten mangoes or a
filthy apricot with some dirty peaches on
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a rotten fruit sort of a smell,
sort of like you're making some some bum
[SPEAKER_00]: wine, some prison hooch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like the very start of that funky
fermentation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, I love that smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just something about fermented
funk that I kind of enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this really hits that note.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you smoke it, that fermented funk
flavor doesn't come through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes through more like a sweet funky
sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually enjoyed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the the head high is just
tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, my head is spinning.
[SPEAKER_00]: From this Apollo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Apollo 13 from Apothecary Farms is what
I'm dabbing today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're smoking something delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you're smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me a tweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at GFYH podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world, let's get this
show on the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we want to start?
[SPEAKER_00]: How about some good news?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been listening to the show for a
while, you've been hearing me talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: making more lemon Jeffrey and more Golden
Goat Feminized Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the creator of the strain Lemon
Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also made the Golden Goat into
Feminized Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not invent or create the Golden
Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I simply put it into Feminized Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't give me credit for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Lemon Jeffrey, however, is my
creation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are both made from a reversed Golden
Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take a girl Golden Goat plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reverse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I turn it into a boy that makes female
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I put that pollen on more Golden Goat
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I put that pollen on more lemon
skunk plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I create Golden Goat Feminized
Seeds and I create Lemon Jeffrey Feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Jeffrey is one of my most popular
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a super sativa with a super lemon
flavor and it harvests very heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: harvests.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been a huge hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I haven't made seeds of that in
several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is time to make more Lemon Jeffrey
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will be available in about 90 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you check back with the Hella
Dank Seed Company at dankseed.store in
[SPEAKER_00]: about 90 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm recording this at the very start of
May.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got all of May and all of June for
them to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's going to take me a little
bit to get the seeds pulled out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: buds and everything packaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're looking into July.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully the middle or the end of July
there will be Golden Goat Lemon Jeffrey
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds available about 90 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bear with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I'm going to make a Instagram
post.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about it on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't be left out and I will not let
you forget about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also speaking of seeds and speaking of the
Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently put a name to one of my new
crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a cross that has needed a name
for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been racking my brain and bugging all
of my friends about what to name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have finally settled on a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strain that I've been trying to name
of course was Stardog to Arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were many great options.
[SPEAKER_00]: I narrowed it down to Starbreaker because
it was Stardog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stardog to Arise and Arise is Daybreaker
and Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was Daybreaker in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to call it Starbreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also somebody in my Instagram live feed
dropped the name Starstruck.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as they said Starstruck I think I
knew that that was going to be the name
[SPEAKER_00]: but I wanted to hesitate because I got
super excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since they said that I've known since
then that the name of that strain was
[SPEAKER_00]: Starstruck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Stardog to Arise is officially called
Starstruck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys thanks for all the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody on my social
media that pitched in with name ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody on my Instagram
live feed that helped with name ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the guy who actually
threw out the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if he wants his name said on
a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also a big shout out to Adam Ill for
helping me narrow down and decide the
[SPEAKER_00]: final names.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys Stardog to Arise is officially
known as Starstruck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get it at dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright I've only got one more thing I
want to talk about before we start getting
[SPEAKER_00]: into some cannabis talk and start reading
some emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about what I got today.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I did do on Thursday night.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys if you listen to the podcast if
you know anything about me you know that I
[SPEAKER_00]: am a huge reggae fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know that Morgan Heritage is my
favorite reggae band.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes me a lot to commit to something
and say that something is my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: To fill that spot really takes a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Morgan Heritage is my favorite reggae
band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alive or dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any country any planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morgan Heritage is my favorite reggae
band.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been on fire for the past two
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me talk about Morgan Heritage for
just a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are mainly three brothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There used to be a sister in the band but
she's not traveling with them anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Miss Una Morgan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is Mr. Mojo Morgan who is a big
smiley dude with big thick dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a big thick man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He plays percussion and backup vocals and
does a little kind of some rappy type
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of reggae songs have that perfect
opportunity for a rap verse and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: always where Mr. Mojo drops in.
[SPEAKER_00]: He walks up to the front of the stage,
throws out a nice clean rap and then walks
[SPEAKER_00]: right back to his percussion and keeps
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in the band is Gramps Morgan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gramps Morgan is another giant man with
giant dreadlocks and a giant smile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a giant heart and a giant voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gramps Morgan plays keyboards.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's his turn to sing he walks out to
the front of the stage and he sings with
[SPEAKER_00]: this super low voice and this big giant
smile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ladies just go crazy for Gramps
Morgan and that giant voice that comes out
[SPEAKER_00]: of that man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes he'll like look at the crowd
like all right if you don't quit screaming
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't sing because nobody can hear me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he loves it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He milks the crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got huge stage presence and he knows
it and he plays it very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's Gramps Morgan.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a ladies man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He makes the ladies go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also love the way the man sings.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got such a soulful style to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's always wearing his sunglasses indoors
because I'm sure his eyes are super red.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just a big happy joyful rasta man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next to them is his brother Peta Morgan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peta Morgan's kind of a small guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not as huge as the other two but he's
got a huge presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a silky smooth Michael Jackson
reggae voice and I think it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sings the high parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got Gramps over there doing the lows
and then he got Peter up there doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: highs and it just the way that they
contrast each other is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: They contrast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They harmonize.
[SPEAKER_00]: They match.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also there's a backup singer named Natasha
that sounds a lot like Peta.
[SPEAKER_00]: They blend very well together but Peta
Morgan has this really great, he's got a
[SPEAKER_00]: very neat accent.
[SPEAKER_00]: His patois accent is very thick and it
comes out very neat when he gets fired up
[SPEAKER_00]: and gets going and he's so passionate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The three brothers and the backup singer
Natasha together have such a great
[SPEAKER_00]: harmonious feel to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could come out and just sing without
instruments and I think it would be a
[SPEAKER_00]: great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Morgan brothers along with Una Morgan,
their sister, have been singing together
[SPEAKER_00]: since they were children so they've got a
really tight vibe to them and they can
[SPEAKER_00]: just look at each other and know what
songs they're gonna play.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't even have to talk and Natasha's
been on tour with them for two or three
[SPEAKER_00]: years now so she's really fallen in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see her finding her space.
[SPEAKER_00]: She knows little drum parts now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be drum fills that she does that
she air drums to the fills.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen this band a lot you guys if you
can't tell but the vibe that this band
[SPEAKER_00]: brings is amazing because they're a family
and they've been together for years and
[SPEAKER_00]: they just bring such a good family vibe
and they're well rehearsed and their
[SPEAKER_00]: harmonies are so strong and Natasha has
fallen in perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also there's another singer that joins
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gramps Morgan's son Jamiri Morgan is an
up-and-coming reggae star.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got an album out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He comes and sings a couple of songs with
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamiri's always great but they would be
awesome without the band is what I said a
[SPEAKER_00]: moment ago but they do bring an amazing
backup band.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bring a bass player who is Toots's
grandson.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Toots Hibbert's grandson.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is an awesome drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's kind of you could call him maybe the
Tony Royster or maybe the Tony Royster
[SPEAKER_00]: junior of reggae music.
[SPEAKER_00]: He looks like Tony Royster and he plays
with that aggressive movement and that
[SPEAKER_00]: non-stop action and he makes a bunch of
great funny faces which I really love in a
[SPEAKER_00]: drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their guitar player is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a reggae band you don't really need a
show-off of a guitar player.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a guy that can keep a solid
rhythm and then throw down a solo when
[SPEAKER_00]: it's needed and the guy they've got does
that perfectly right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been on tour with them for quite a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's recorded with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fit together so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a keyboard player.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same story as the guitarist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need a guy that can hold the
rhythm and remember all of the songs and
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the changes and pull off a solo
when needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their keyboard player can also throw out
some rap verses.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are one or two songs where he'll
grab a mic and run up to the front of the
[SPEAKER_00]: stage and spit out a rap verse and then
run back to the keyboards and keep
[SPEAKER_00]: playing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's always fun when your guys can
add more stuff to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah Morgan Heritage just has a bunch
of great musicians, a bunch of great
[SPEAKER_00]: singers, they're great to go see.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bring such a good vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always leave there with such good energy
and I always feel so refreshed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Morgan Heritage was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the show was opened by... There were
a couple acts that I didn't make it on
[SPEAKER_00]: time for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to leave work, I had to come home,
get cleaned up, drive out of town and get
[SPEAKER_00]: there and then parking took for freaking
ever and then getting into the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I missed a couple of the opening acts
but I did catch a new up-and-coming artist
[SPEAKER_00]: by the name of Anna Lee Brown,
a very beautiful young lady from the
[SPEAKER_00]: islands who sang like an angel.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had some poppy reggae type stuff that
I was really enjoying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also there was a group that was fronted by
a man by the name of Fiji.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never seen Fiji live until that
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't even heard that much of them
until I saw Morgan Heritage was going on
[SPEAKER_00]: tour with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently in Hawaii Fiji is super popular
and apparently in Colorado Springs we have
[SPEAKER_00]: a big gathering of people from Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a large community of Hawaiians or
islanders in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not aware of that because this guy
Fiji and his brother Maui come to do
[SPEAKER_00]: reggae and everybody from the islands and
everybody from the island community that
[SPEAKER_00]: lives in Springs they all filled the black
sheep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys I've never seen the black sheep
this full for a Morgan Heritage show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year when I went to see Morgan
Heritage there there were maybe 30 to 50
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe 75 people in the entire club during
Morgan Heritage's set.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time the place was sold out,
it was packed, people knew all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: words to Fiji and his friend Maui.
[SPEAKER_00]: They knew all the words to these guys'
songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also knew all the words to Annali
Brown's songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never heard of these bands before
but the islanders knew every word.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the way that guy Fiji gets
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude's got some soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a big dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can sing high, he can sing low,
and he also isn't afraid to get silly on
[SPEAKER_00]: stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll crack himself up in the middle of a
song and have some fun which I really
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy seeing an artist do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that I really enjoyed was
the band that backs up Fiji and Maui.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come on stage and they play a
pre-recorded Polynesian sounding
[SPEAKER_00]: soundtrack and it may I'm not sure what it
was honestly I have never heard anything
[SPEAKER_00]: like that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was intense and it was very neat but
when that ends the band goes into an
[SPEAKER_00]: instrumental and they play an instrumental
really intense instrumental jam while Fiji
[SPEAKER_00]: and Maui walk out onto the stage and then
once the singers get out onto the stage
[SPEAKER_00]: they start doing a chant and I don't want
to sound offensive but they say it's
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaiian words and it's short sentences
and it's just like and then the crowd
[SPEAKER_00]: responds with like just quick words back
and then fucking the band did it again and
[SPEAKER_00]: then the crowd responded back and I have
no idea what the fuck's going on you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were like 50 or 75 Polynesian people
surrounding me and I was the tallest
[SPEAKER_00]: person in the front row by like an entire
foot and they all knew what was happening
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was just kind of looking around like
wow this is fucking amazing it was really
[SPEAKER_00]: neat it was really intense I was also high
as giraffe pussy that may have had
[SPEAKER_00]: something to do with it but this went on
for two or three solid minutes and then at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of it the guy ended it with like a
really high one he's like and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: all did this really high pitch thing and
then they stopped instantly like all
[SPEAKER_00]: together and then the band took off
playing reggae music it was really intense
[SPEAKER_00]: it was really beautiful it was really neat
I've never seen anything like it so if you
[SPEAKER_00]: get the chance you guys go see Fiji and
Maui they were fucking awesome and always
[SPEAKER_00]: go see Morrigan Heritage reggae music just
makes me feel so good if you can't tell by
[SPEAKER_00]: the enthusiasm in my voice when I talk
about it you guys I need to take a dab I
[SPEAKER_00]: need to calm down a little bit I also need
to get some water so I'm gonna press pause
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube doesn't like it when I play reggae
music but I'm gonna sneak in a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds of some Morrigan Heritage and then
I'll be right back and we will talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis thanks for hanging out you guys
what you doing
[SPEAKER_02]: to destroy all things
[SPEAKER_01]: is destruction for the children
[SPEAKER_00]: all right podcast world I am back thanks
for hanging out and jamming some reggae
[SPEAKER_00]: music with me let's get into some emails
this first email comes from a listener I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not sure if he wants me to say his name he
clearly typed his name here in the email
[SPEAKER_00]: but I am not going to say it just out of
respect he says hey Rasta Jeff aloha it's
[SPEAKER_00]: me I live in Maui Hawaii how are you doing
hope all is iry man first off I hope all
[SPEAKER_00]: is well with you it looks like the big
island is erupting and I hope you and your
[SPEAKER_00]: family and all of your people are safe the
email goes on to say I made a big big iry
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics purchase on 420 during the sale
and I look forward to running your beans I
[SPEAKER_00]: got an email from the hella dank seed bank
about your blueberry cookies crosses I
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't heard you talk about this on the
podcast I know you've had trouble in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past with genetic labeling with this
company I was wondering if this is your
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics first off yes those are my
genetics those are my blueberry cookies
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized crosses I've been talking about
that a little bit on the show recently
[SPEAKER_00]: also the hella dank seed company is not
who was mislabeling my stuff it was the
[SPEAKER_00]: dank team the dankteam.com was getting
bulk seeds and then just inventing a name
[SPEAKER_00]: for them strains that I hadn't named yet
they were just putting a name on it so the
[SPEAKER_00]: hella dank seed company is totally cool
they have never done me wrong they've
[SPEAKER_00]: never mislabeled anything I fully support
and endorse them those are my seeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got I no longer do business with
the vendor that was changing my names so
[SPEAKER_00]: when they run out of my seeds they won't
be able to advertise that they've got any
[SPEAKER_00]: of my products they won't be able to give
out any of my freebies and they certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: will not be able to change any of my
strain names or invent names for me so I
[SPEAKER_00]: fully endorse and fully support the hella
dank seed company they've never done me
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong those are my blueberry cookies
crosses on there and also they're gonna go
[SPEAKER_00]: very quickly so make sure you grab them

[SPEAKER_00]: love the podcast brother keep up the good
work I don't have a question then he says
[SPEAKER_00]: wait I do have a question and it's a
really good question too so I'm glad you
[SPEAKER_00]: came up with this he says do you map where
you get the seeds off of the plant like do
[SPEAKER_00]: you save main stock seeds lower plant
seeds and upper cola seeds do you map
[SPEAKER_00]: where you take them off of the plant
because I feel when I run main stock seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: I get cup winners my patients feedback is
that they are a lot more potent than bud
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds if you do use the question on your
podcast you can use my real name I don't

the Golden Goat.

[SPEAKER_00]: That was done by a guy named Mr. Dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the clone from a friend that I call,
I call him Pineapple Express just because
[SPEAKER_00]: he's from Hawaii, and a lot of Hawaii
references in the past week.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the clone from that guy,
and I loved it, so I bred with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But shout out to Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also says, I was curious what your
thoughts are on the pathogen deathwands I
[SPEAKER_00]: hear so much about from California
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm experimenting with a 1000 watt HPS and
an infrared UV LED as a cheaper
[SPEAKER_00]: alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: The death wand sounds like it's too good
to be true and costs $500 to $800 a piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't justify that expense, so I'm
making my own from LED strands and
[SPEAKER_00]: different light spectrums.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he said thanks again,
and then he signed his name and I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: sure if he wants that said, so I'm not
gonna share that out of respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey dude, thanks for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you'd like to send me an
email, it's growfromyourheartathotmail
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to answer your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about pathogen deathwands.
[SPEAKER_00]: What he's talking about, you guys,
it kind of looks like a lightsaber.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different versions of them
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a lightsaber with the shield
over one end of it so that that way the
[SPEAKER_00]: light doesn't shine into your face from
that direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of looks like one of those,
like a bug light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different versions, but the one
I'm familiar with plugs into the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a handle on it that you would
kind of hold sort of like the weed eater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're gonna do the weed eater,
the handle is kind of shaped like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's got basically a small light
reflector on it with a light bulb inside
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a UV light inside of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that light does is it destroys
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: That UV light breaks down powdery mildew
almost instantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what growers will do is they will
plug in this light and you've got to wear
[SPEAKER_00]: protective eyewear.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell you certain glasses with this
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to wear those glasses and do not
by any means ever look into your death
[SPEAKER_00]: wand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is called a fucking death wand.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look into it, your eyes are toast,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: You will go blind.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing is not a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be really serious about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things we play with in
the grow that can hurt us.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, you will instantly feel the
effect you will be fucking blind,
[SPEAKER_00]: no more Fortnite.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I don't play video games,
but everyone's stuck on Fortnite right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you fuck up with the pathogen death
wand and look into it, you don't get to
[SPEAKER_00]: play Fortnite anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pathogen death wand, they're making
them with that's a UV light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're putting different types of lights
in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hold it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got this handle like I explained.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the reflector coming off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's got a light that shines down
and you just simply walk down the rows of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and just shine this light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the canopy and try to get the light
on each leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't touch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shine it over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go about 10 to 14 inches away and you
just hover that light above every single
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf and you try to get it over each leaf
for about one to two seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go too long, it will kind of
wrinkle and burn the leaves if you stay
[SPEAKER_00]: there too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would pick a spot that you can get to
and just shine the light over there and
[SPEAKER_00]: then just start walking down that row and
then finish that row and then go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: other side of the table and walk up that
row.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you can't get to the middle,
maybe reach your arm out real far,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe hang it on a pole or something,
put it on a PVC pipe or a two by four and
[SPEAKER_00]: just get it a little extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just do your best to get over the entire
canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to get that light over each and
every leaf of that whole canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ever do it while the plants are wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if you've got morning dew or if
you've applied not the strain morning dew,
[SPEAKER_00]: actual morning dew, like some dew in the
morning, some moisture, or if you've
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayed the plants or if it's rained or
something like that, don't shine this UV
[SPEAKER_00]: light over any more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just walk the rows and shine the light
over every single plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to help you get rid of
your powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to help you get rid of other
spores and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is, the one that you are
making, I'm not sure it is going to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: correct spectrum and the correct lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason they're so expensive is because
they're using the UV light and the
[SPEAKER_00]: infrared lighting, and those are
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand you're trying to save a few
bucks but I'm not sure if you're using the
[SPEAKER_00]: right spectrums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know how it works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're already battling PM and you run
your thousand watt HPS and your infrared
[SPEAKER_00]: and UV and LEDs, if you run that over
there and it destroys your powdery mildew,
[SPEAKER_00]: let me know how that works because you're
right, those death ones are somewhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen them for as low as $400 for a
very entry level one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would probably take you two weeks to
run that little light over your entire
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have to be at it every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, they are super expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope your homemade MacGyver device works
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish you the best of luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand not being able to justify the
expense at the time, but what you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to really have to do is you're going to
have to figure out what is causing the
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just simply treating it with the death
wand all of the time is not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to find yourself in there way
too frequently, spending way too many man
[SPEAKER_00]: hours trying to fight this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be more cost effective to
eliminate the problem, find the cause and
[SPEAKER_00]: correct that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you need more HVAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you need more dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe your vapor pressure deficit is off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's too cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you have too far of a swing in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have something in that room that is
letting you know what your temperatures
[SPEAKER_00]: are constantly?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we've all got the hygrometer that
hangs in the room, the hygrometer
[SPEAKER_00]: thermometer combo that lets you know how
hot it got and how cool it got.
[SPEAKER_00]: But does it tell you for how long and when
it happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: We need something that lets us know what's
going on in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So find out what's happening in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet your problem is happening right when
the lights go off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's usually the temperatures drop,
the humidity goes real high because all
[SPEAKER_00]: that moisture is in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got all that dew in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just welcoming powdery mildew right
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So find out what's happening in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you will not have to spend money on a
death wand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't have to spend hours on time
walking around shining a light over
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't feel like you're doing anything
when you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used one of these things before in
another grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did not feel like anything was
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see that the powdery mildew would
disappear, but you're just walking around
[SPEAKER_00]: shining a light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like such a waste of time when
there are such other important things to
[SPEAKER_00]: be done in a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope this does work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You asked about my thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you buy the appropriate death wand,
it will work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually make lights out of the same
UV and infrared that go inside of your
[SPEAKER_00]: HVAC equipment that will work to kill the
spores in the HVAC as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're quite expensive to install,
but they're constantly running and
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that passes through your HVAC
system will then be killed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will not even make it to your grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other alternatives that aren't
as expensive, but the first thing you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to do is correct the issue in the grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So figure out what's causing the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then implement that solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully you can stop having powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the pathogen death wand is sort
of like taking cough medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we need to do is take better care of
ourselves so that we don't get a cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're out there with a cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to make sure that we don't get a
cold again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's figure out what caused the
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's implement a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the meantime, I hope your makeshift
death wand works out for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am curious how it works because we could
save a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people, a lot of money if they
don't have to spend the five to $800 on
[SPEAKER_00]: the horticultural death wand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey dude, I really do appreciate this
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to your response.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to following up with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, if anybody out there
has a question about cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: about cannabis growing, about cannabis
consumption, about cannabis politics,
[SPEAKER_00]: if there are any myths or rumors or
anything you'd like cleared up about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, I would be happy to answer your
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you've got to do is send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you will hear your question answered
on a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more quick email I want to
read.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I do that, I want to give a
couple of quick shout outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe a huge shout out to my buddy,
Dank Sinatra.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, buddy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a hug and a shout out to Cannabliss,
a big old fist bump and a high five to
[SPEAKER_00]: Warpath Glass and a big old Viking
handshake to my buddy Grimbold the Druid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the love and support you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I've got one more email and it
goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, stay iry and stay
elevated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a new grower and a new podcast host.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard you say that YouTube will not
accept your music and I've been having the
[SPEAKER_00]: same issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a big problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear how you resolve this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You and the DGC, which is the Dude Grows
crew, inspired me and my buddy,
[SPEAKER_00]: Soup, to start up a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I think I met Soup at the Dude Grows
cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Soup.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, We shot you out on episode two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our podcast is called Let's Smoke
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check it out at Let'sSmokeCannabis.com,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sent me a link here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on the link.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, go check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let'sSmokeCannabis.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, You're great for the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for everything, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the best way to promote your
podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: Positive vibes and cheers from bong.cally.
[SPEAKER_00]: P.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hit up your Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you for the Patreon
contribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the best way to promote?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you asking the best way for you to
promote my show?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the best way to promote a podcast in
general?
[SPEAKER_00]: My answer is gonna kind of be the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way to promote your podcast is
just to focus on putting out quality
[SPEAKER_00]: content.
[SPEAKER_00]: People hear podcasts and when they hear
it, excuse the throat clearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, hold on for just one quick
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so people hear quality content
and when they hear it, they like it and
[SPEAKER_00]: they talk about it and they tell their
friends and then their friends listen to
[SPEAKER_00]: it and their friends do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way that I have found to
advertise and promote a podcast is just to
[SPEAKER_00]: focus on doing a quality show and the show
will promote itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more people listen, the more you get
moved up in iTunes, the more you get moved
[SPEAKER_00]: up in Stitcher and then more people
listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about promoting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focus on your job, which is doing a
quality show and a quality product will
[SPEAKER_00]: sell itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a little bit of Instagram,
a little bit of social media is good for
[SPEAKER_00]: you, but don't overdo it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get too caught up trying to be
relevant to where you push yourself out of
[SPEAKER_00]: being relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your job and things will come the way
that they're supposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I say.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way, if you want to promote your
podcast, light social media, maybe just
[SPEAKER_00]: word of mouth and do a great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way to promote my podcast,
just say, hey, listen to the Grow From
[SPEAKER_00]: Your Heart podcast on your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like I'm going to say, listen to
Let's Smoke Cannabis, the new cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast with my friends, Soup and Bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's his name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, fuck, stew, beef stew, roast,
pot roast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Took me a fucking minute to remember his
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I called you stew, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucked up pot roast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call him roast now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, check out that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's Smoke Cannabis dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move up and see the rest of the
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said he's a new grower and a new
podcast host.
[SPEAKER_00]: They keep it up, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you're off to a good start
on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have listened YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube is not they will accept my
submissions with other people's music,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I cannot monetize it and they give me
little strikes against my account for
[SPEAKER_00]: copyright violations.
[SPEAKER_00]: My resolution has been to create my own
opening and closing music and not play
[SPEAKER_00]: other people's music on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I fucked that all up on this
episode because I couldn't resist and I
[SPEAKER_00]: had to play some Morgan Heritage for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this episode simply won't be
monetized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I don't make a penny off of my
YouTube channel because I don't get enough
[SPEAKER_00]: views for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't even matter if I were Joe
Rogan or something that would make a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: difference to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure Rogan makes thousands of dollars
per YouTube episode and I don't make
[SPEAKER_00]: pennies, so I don't mind losing the
monetization of one show that wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have gotten paid anything anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just my way around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll let the episodes go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just can't monetize it and they give me
a little copyright strikes and they let me
[SPEAKER_00]: know that they're looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to be careful as a cannabis
community because right now YouTube is
[SPEAKER_00]: taking down all of the cannabis channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully I survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully Let's Smoke Cannabis survives.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, that was my resolution is I
just made my own music and I try to
[SPEAKER_00]: refrain from using copywritten music that
is not owned by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that you could do is you
could record your episode and then you can
[SPEAKER_00]: add the music and post it to iTunes and
then you could go however you're
[SPEAKER_00]: recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use GarageBand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go into GarageBand and just delete
the music track and then post that file to
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube instead of using the music part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little bit different experience
for the different listeners, but that's
[SPEAKER_00]: all right because nobody will know unless
they listen on two different platforms and
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll just be missing music.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my recommendation would just be to
either make your own song or recruit
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody with the proper software and the
time and skills to make a song for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pay people to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are services where you can go and
have them create a custom jingle for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if that's in your budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't considered doing that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to get one of my favorite
reggae artists to do a dub plate for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some custom music made.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said you're great for the community and
thanks for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey dude, thanks for the huge compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that and you're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for what you're doing for the
community and extra thanks for the
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every month the Patreon gets bigger and
bigger and I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm moving toward a goal and I can't wait
to reach that goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys check out patreon.com slash grow
from your heart for all of that
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend Bong, thanks again for the great

episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys, if I don't respond to your
email, don't take it personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got over a hundred unread emails in
my inbox right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will get to the emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I slowly work my way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, some of the emails that I've
gotten this pile of printed emails are
[SPEAKER_00]: from about a year ago, but I'm still going
to read them because they're still
[SPEAKER_00]: relevant questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of behind on the person that
needed help, but hopefully I can help
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, keep the emails
coming, keep supporting the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely appreciate all of the
interaction with everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love it if you support me on
social media.

[SPEAKER_00]: On Instagram, I'm irey underscore
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do Instagram live videos where I
go and hang out and smoke dabs and talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let people ask me cannabis questions and
I answer on the fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any preparation, so it's kind
of fun for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun for the viewers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun to just hang out and smoke with
me sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as put together as the podcast,
so I kind of chill out a little bit and
[SPEAKER_00]: have a little more fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check me out on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's irey underscore genetics.

[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, like I've mentioned before,
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are currently 260 videos available
on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how long the YouTube channel
is going to last.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube is on a crackdown, taking all the
cannabis channels and cannabis material
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So catch them while you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep posting videos until they shut
me down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I will get caught up to episode,
this is 312.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plan to have all, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plan to have all 312 episodes up there
unless they shut me down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if they shut me down,
I'll join a new service.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about some stuff on a
future episode, some more options.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay tuned for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I've mentioned it already,

[SPEAKER_00]: I would just like some help covering the
price of the new computer I bought for the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also covering the website for the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also these little microphone covers and my
internet connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just asking for a little help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not trying to beg.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few people out there who have
offered to contribute, who have wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously there are several people who do
enjoy supporting the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you to all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, patreon.com slash
grow from your heart is how you can help
[SPEAKER_00]: out the show and I would appreciate the
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I feel like I'm
talking super fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I got super rambly at the end
of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to wrap it up so that it's a
good show before I get off topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to
everybody out there on the big island.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care of yourselves.

[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you
[SPEAKER_02]: so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: See how they do in the things over there.
And if you thought there was something to
fear, just some time back when you was a
little tack and they said don't do this,
a child will do that, please.
Maybe you said you do.
Maybe you said you don't.
But then you figured it out.
So laugh who don't.
Yeah, to be the days of innocent fun.
Now we're living with purpose in your
kingdom.
What's the problem?
[SPEAKER_03]: What you say?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the beef?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the future is the time that you
take to make your dream come true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.
