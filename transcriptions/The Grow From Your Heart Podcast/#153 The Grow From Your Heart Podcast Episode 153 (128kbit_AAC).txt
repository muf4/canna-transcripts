[SPEAKER_02]: music on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big thanks to Kat, Coot and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies and gentlemen, this episode I'm
joined by White Mike and we talk a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: about CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: The episode was kind of long, so I'm not
going to waste a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to let the music play.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we get back, Mike and I will be
at the dab table.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hang out with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you record?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just now did.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you seriously aren't going to cough?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was all I got from you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always a little... Yeah,
I knew you were going to cough a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll just get some things set up here to
get the settings all accurate so that it
[SPEAKER_01]: sounds real good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might have been good had you not
mentioned something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm coughing, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got a pretty funny text message.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, they may hear the air conditioner in
the back just because of what I got set
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there's some headphones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing, Mike?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you bring the headphones down just a
touch, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bam.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's a little low.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That thing is touchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Needed a couple of... And I think we got
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying not to cough in the microphone,
getting everything set up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we are ready to do a podcast,
ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just going to go from here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seat backs and tray tables, folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the upright position.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody's in any upright position here.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kick it back and drop that tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is funny shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I wanted to talk about first is
everyone's talking about this honey bee
[SPEAKER_02]: thing on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen that a couple of spots.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are claiming that this dude in
France has trained his honey bees to make
[SPEAKER_02]: THC laden honey by collecting THC from
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I'm not a bee expert, but I don't
think that's how this works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here to say that I don't think that
this is real.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's bullshit, to tell you the
truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first saw it online, I was like,
oh, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bees collect pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trichomes collect pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are not themselves pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pistols collect the pollen to be more
accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the pollen is actually used as a
defense against insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they do show pictures of bees on the
female cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what somebody says in one of these
debunking websites, because I did do
[SPEAKER_02]: research before I came on a podcast and
said that it was bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did do some research to back myself up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They claim that they just simply sprayed
sugar water on the budding female plants
[SPEAKER_02]: to encourage those bees to land there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, maybe a little bit of THC will stick
to those bees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just a marketing ploy for homies'
honey?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in his video, they do show male plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I think may be happening,
and I'm going to back up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy says he's getting THC honey from
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: He can be doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He may be- That's totally a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not going to be psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: He may be getting pollen from male
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those bees are gathering that pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're flying back to their hive.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're putting that pollen in the little
thing that they put in that little
[SPEAKER_02]: honeycomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they actually, bees actually chew
up the pollen in their mouths and they
[SPEAKER_02]: regurgitate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And something in their regurgitation
creates the nectar to turn into honey.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, this is why I don't like knowing how
everything's made.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nature is fucking gross.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really liked honey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm going to have to try to not think
about the fact that it's bee vomit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's straight up bee puke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey bees, your puke's pretty tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta say.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's got some really cool medicinal
effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your puke's way better than mine,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: So gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: So gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Side note, side note, totally random side
note.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jelly Belly has created some new flavors
and one of their new flavors is vomit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, bad Jelly Belly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who wants it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Vomit flavored Jelly Belly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these flies, these bees are going and
they're collecting, they could be
[SPEAKER_02]: collecting the male pollen from these male
plants and flying back and creating honey
[SPEAKER_02]: out of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is very feasible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not see how they could land on a
female cannabis plant with trichomes on it
[SPEAKER_02]: and gather trichomes and fly enough
trichomes back to the hive to make
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis honey.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't seem feasible to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't see them purposefully
gathering the trichomes either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any sort of trichome gathering is going
to be incidental or accidental.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that it's, have you ever been
trimming and rub your eye?
[SPEAKER_01]: Super, yeah, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It burns.
[SPEAKER_01]: We spend like the first half hour at any
new trim gig warning the new people not to
[SPEAKER_01]: do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And somebody will do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody will just rub their eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant gives off pheromones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes people have allergy style
reactions to it and sometimes your face
[SPEAKER_01]: gets itchy when you're trimming.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you rub your eye and it burns.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you only make that mistake once.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like getting maced and it sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't make it quit because your
fingers are sticky because you're
[SPEAKER_02]: trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that the pH was far too hot for
these bees to be able to handle it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would burn the bees.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they would just be like,
nah, fuck this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want anything to do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I don't know if it would be too
acidic or to like burn them, but I think
[SPEAKER_01]: that the stickiness of the tackiness would
annoy the shit out of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's definitely part of what the
trichome is designed to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's to partially to keep those bugs away
from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could see this totally be like,
there may be serious benefits to bees
[SPEAKER_01]: collecting male cannabis pollen and
turning that into honey, but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely not like weed honey is as
advertised.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very cool marketing ploy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a very cool video, but I think it is
inaccurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's misleading and I don't think
you're getting THC honey.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see this happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want it to be somebody said earlier,
they ain't going to do it on the honor
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to watch them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, make this honey.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I want to watch the bees do their
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I want to take that honey to a
lab and let Steep Hill test that honey for
[SPEAKER_02]: me and see what type of cannabinoids are
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's what I was thinking when we
were kind of talking about this before the
[SPEAKER_01]: show is for that to happen, we would have
to bring this little homie to Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: with his bees and his cannabis plants,
because that's the only place on the
[SPEAKER_01]: planet where we could really collect and
lab test that in a controlled way without
[SPEAKER_01]: him going to jail immediately after.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he can do it in Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe he's in France, so he's just a
border jump away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Spain's grow home grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't looked at him for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think Spain cares because they
have spannabis and there's a hillside in
[SPEAKER_02]: Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget the name of the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel bad that I can't remember the name
of the region, but there's a small region
[SPEAKER_02]: in Spain where they do not care about
cannabis growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, uh, they might have the ability to
grow, but do they have the access to the
[SPEAKER_01]: same testing kind of labs that we do?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very good question because both
in the same area are one of the things
[SPEAKER_01]: that make Colorado's cannabis market so
awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, come to Colorado, bring your bees,
bring your, bring your gear.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do what we got to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to see this happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to test your bees.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've heard about the dude in,
uh, on a mildly related note, the dude in
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon that's doing the hogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: He, uh, um, you know how here the waste
from the cannabis grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to do specific stuff with it so
it doesn't end up in teenager's hands or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever out of your dumpster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to be ground up into little tiny
pieces, run through a wood chipper and
[SPEAKER_02]: then mixed with other product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: A shop up.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Oregon, um, hog found a hog farmer to
take care of a farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so they take all that plant
material and, uh, I, I'm not exactly sure
[SPEAKER_01]: what he, what the farmer does to it
between picking it up from the shop and
[SPEAKER_01]: dropping it off with the pigs,
but I'm assuming it's not much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and they chat out on that as a primary
food source for most of their life.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, uh, the Rocky mountain worm
company in Colorado Springs has a deal
[SPEAKER_02]: worked out with the very well known vape
pen company, uh, open.
[SPEAKER_02]: They grow their products in their
warehouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: They chop down their plants and the waste
from their plants is then, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's mixed properly so that it's,
uh, MED compliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the MED has approved this transaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: They send all of the waste to the Rocky
mountain worm company and the Rocky
[SPEAKER_02]: mountain worm company feeds that back to
their worms and the worms compost that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the Rocky mountain worm company
in turn sells their worm castings at a
[SPEAKER_02]: discount back to open vapes grow and it
goes full circle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's getting reused and refed back to
the worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of keeping it a little more
eco-friendly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to learn as growers, as
professional responsible growers,
[SPEAKER_02]: it is time to figure out how to reduce our
carbon footprint.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how to do that very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a lot of the places, the,
the laws around cannabis make that
[SPEAKER_01]: specific topic incredibly brutal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Boulder, I think they have to run
solar to offset all of their electricity
[SPEAKER_02]: or something similar to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They passed a law in Boulder saying a
hundred marijuana businesses had to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred percent energy neutral,
which means they can't consume any power
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't generate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and immediately after passing that
law, they realized how, um, unenforceable
[SPEAKER_01]: or not unenforceable, but unfeasible it
was to require that immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so they've been given some time to
upgrade, but, uh, um, that's one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: things that made Pueblo so popular is that
we allow greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Denver is not allowed greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boulder does not allow a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have the prime greenhouse area
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a perfect greenhouse country.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful country here to grow
cannabis or hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: We designated, uh, um, a whole bunch of
water, just kind of set it aside for,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that's all we'll lease to
marijuana grows at the beginning of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've barely touched that number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so there's a ton of that still kind of
in reserve, even with the industry as big
[SPEAKER_01]: as it is down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the hardest things to do is
to get the water rights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you get something set up,
you have to get a water lawyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was something nobody thought of until
about a year and a half, two years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: when we finally finished the rules and
regs process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you can't just hammer out a well and
go, and go to town down here in Southern
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a lot of rules when it comes to
water here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they know, they know that big
commercial grows are coming and trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: use up the water and they want to keep it
for you and I to drink, which is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they've got a good water plan
down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all that's taken care of the,
it's one of the more recent anti pot
[SPEAKER_01]: talking points is how much water the plant
drinks or how much energy growing and
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, well, you know,
if you didn't prohibit it in 46 of the 50
[SPEAKER_01]: states, more of it would be grown under
the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we'd be using significantly less power
to produce all this.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we could just grow it outdoors,
like a normal crop, but, Oh no.
[SPEAKER_02]: When do we vote on the city elections for
200 and 300?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, in the presidential November,
November, November 8th, we will put out a
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making a note.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do an election podcast at some point
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not that episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to guide people on what to vote on
locally, but very specifically we'll do
[SPEAKER_02]: that on a whole nother show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do a little segment on it just for
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the date today?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is today the ninth today may be the ninth.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yesterday was the last day for people
to submit ballot issue paperwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the final election ballots,
they're all hammering out that paperwork
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll have all the final information
for November here in a week or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do an episode to teach you guys
locally what to vote for because the
[SPEAKER_02]: wording is confusing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be, it's more,
way more than one question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just going to be a yes or no
vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes for weed vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: No against weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be much more complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this episode, I want to put this back
on some, some edumacational topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back on the rails.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back on some rails.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike's had a headache and he took a couple
of dabs of CBD when I got here and he's a
[SPEAKER_02]: really, his color came back.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's more relaxed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see that the headache has kind of
gone away a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You feeling better, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm feeling a lot better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's the proper container?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I got three of them that look alike.
[SPEAKER_01]: The product I'm consuming right now is 3%
THC, 1.3% CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: 38.99% CBDA and six or 36.32% THCA and an
additional 6% CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this has got a bizarrely wide range of
cannabinoids in it and a really good on
[SPEAKER_01]: headaches amongst other things,
pain and inflammation as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of hash would you call that?
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of?
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends what temperature it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's intended as a shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: At about 65 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pretty nice shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shatters real nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 70.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really sticky taffy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you take two pieces and you pull it
apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just kind of stretches into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched you try to get a dab out of
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be a little tricky to get a dab out
of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, it aboves like 65.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what he's talking about is a smokable
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's some hash, some shatter with a pretty
good CBD to THC ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about 50 50.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could tell Mike was hurting about 20
minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had a pretty good headache and he took
two dabs of that and then put on his
[SPEAKER_02]: headphones like, all right, dude,
let's record a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the CBD definitely reduced the pain in
your headache and it improved your
[SPEAKER_02]: attitude because of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel a hundred percent better now that
I've put something that's half and half
[SPEAKER_01]: THC, CBD into my system for the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: My knees feel better.
[SPEAKER_01]: My neck, the tension in my neck feels
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a wicked headache when I got here,
folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, we're sitting at the table kind of
catching up and dabbing and I'm basically
[SPEAKER_01]: just staring at the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rubbing my eyes and my temples because it
hurts so bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking I might not podcast tonight
and I might just have to bail after a dab
[SPEAKER_01]: or two and go home because I'm hurting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the addition of some CBD into my world
has reset that completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been a big fan of CBD for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good for what ails you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that I, and I, I've said it on
the show, I'm not a huge smoker of CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't use a lot of CBD products.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I smoke, I prefer a 90 ounce THC head
buzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make my head spin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get confused.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get goofy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get talkative.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what a good sativa does to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I smoke too much CBD, I honestly just
get lazy and it kind of ruins my high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm not stoned right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, I took four knobs,
all THC dabs here a minute ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I had a nice little buzz going on,
but right before the show, I didn't want
[SPEAKER_01]: my headache to come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I took two more, um, half and half THC
CBD dabs and it, uh, it brought me my high
[SPEAKER_01]: back down to like a two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you, I've got some pineapple Jack,
I've got some pineapple Jack.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to dab with that, feel free to
reach in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to pull this piece off right
here for myself, but here's some shatter
[SPEAKER_02]: piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like six of my dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a flag.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does look like kind of like a flag.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you had a model train, that dab would
be American flag size.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it would.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably about 0.3 ish.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so I, I don't use a lot of CBD
products, but one time, uh, listeners of
[SPEAKER_02]: this podcast will know, uh, over a year
ago in April of 2015, CBD lube incident,
[SPEAKER_02]: but no, uh, when I hit my head,
I hit my head in April and I was having
[SPEAKER_02]: issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, my head hurt for three weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like honestly, my head was throbbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I w I was fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a traumatic brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a traumatic brain injury.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have post-concussion syndrome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a lot of, it's been over 18 months
and I still have effects from that
[SPEAKER_02]: concussion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knocked myself clean the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was out for a good 30 to 45 seconds,
like unconscious on the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: People had to pick me up, get me going
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it fucked me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: My head hurt for several days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could not get right.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I took a dab of, Oh, you weren't
yourself for six weeks after.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I wasn't myself for six months after
it felt like there was a substantial
[SPEAKER_01]: improvement after about six weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, it's, it took half a year
before you were feeling like yourself all
[SPEAKER_01]: the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Spencer would invite me over just to
check on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'd be like, bro, come hang out,
come kick it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been like, you could tell I was
getting depressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause when you hit your head and have a
traumatic brain injury, you get depressed
[SPEAKER_02]: and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you're not the same that you used to
be.
[SPEAKER_02]: My skills weren't where they were.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was bummed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my friends were really hanging out,
trying to help me out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to all my friends that helped me
through that head injury, but Spence would
[SPEAKER_02]: invite me over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one night he's like, bro, I made some
CBD hash oil for the cannabis cup and this
[SPEAKER_02]: shit actually won the best CBD concentrate
at the high times cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he gave me a big fat dab of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, dog hit this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause when I would smoke normal shatter,
like THC or sativas, my head would throb
[SPEAKER_02]: even more.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would just feel like, and I could feel
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it felt like I had, it felt like I had
a belt around my head or like my hat was
[SPEAKER_02]: way too tight is what it felt like all
day, every day for a couple, for like
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Spence gives me these CBD dabs and I
breathed in with the dab and I blew out
[SPEAKER_02]: that dab and it felt like you just undid
that belt about one notch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't like fix it, but it totally
undid that belt a notch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Maddie and Spence looked at me and
they go, wow, did that help?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, yeah, how could you tell?
[SPEAKER_02]: And like you sat up, your neck went
straight again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, you've been like slouching weird
and you've been like crooked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, well, let me get another
dab like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after like three or four of those CBD
dabs, I was like, I haven't felt this good
[SPEAKER_02]: since before I hit my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it really did something to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It fixed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they gave me some of that stuff and
they're like dab this like dab it every
[SPEAKER_02]: day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it got me, it really did help.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found a good half THC half CBD mix
about, oh, maybe two years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really hard to come by back
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've got a lot of inflammation in like
my knees and my neck where it's just for
[SPEAKER_01]: one stupid medical reason or another,
the bones grind on each other and the
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue gets swollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're both over, you're like six four,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm six five.
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably weigh a good two 30,
I'm guessing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not good at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not good at that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mike's probably 250 issue over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm guessing by that reaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm right about 200 pounds most of the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: These knees, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: God, our knees get, there's so much
leverage going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our size is legs.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many times have you stood up into like
a heating duct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just cramped your neck.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I busted my head, I really jerked my
neck back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been in car accidents.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of fun stuff here that you
can tumble down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cartwheels with skis unreleasing on my
feet was one of the really fun ones that
[SPEAKER_01]: led to no cartilage in either knee.
[SPEAKER_01]: I rode bicycles as a kid in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the end result, all this trauma over
the years of having fun in Colorado is
[SPEAKER_01]: that there's a lot of inflammation and a
lot of swelling in a places that press on
[SPEAKER_01]: nerves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that causes phantom nerve pain or
basically the same stuff amputees get when
[SPEAKER_01]: they lose a finger and then the finger
tingles or hurts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those nerves create or make up or feel
that they're getting signals they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: really getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can feel like it's tingling or
tickling, or it can feel like it's on fire
[SPEAKER_01]: or stuck in a car door or it'll go numb.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I first stumbled on medical
marijuana, that was one of the things I
[SPEAKER_01]: liked is it would help me ignore that
sensation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it wasn't until I found something that
was a good ratio with THC CBD that I
[SPEAKER_01]: really started to attack that inflammation
and bring it down to a point where it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't hurt anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's hard to explain to somebody when
you're at work and they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: why are you rubbing your hand?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, well, because the three
small fingers are numb and the,
[SPEAKER_01]: my thumb and my index finger feel like
they're stuck in a car door.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, that when I woke up and I
can't make it go away, but like,
[SPEAKER_01]: which jacket did you want to try on?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just one of those things that sucks
that you just have to deal with until I
[SPEAKER_01]: found something with, that really helped
that inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just taking random pills that the
doctor gave me and going to the
[SPEAKER_01]: chiropractor and the pills didn't do a
fucking thing other than mess with my
[SPEAKER_01]: stomach and my liver.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the chiropractor was helping some.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I found something that's half THC
half CBD, that inflammation really started
[SPEAKER_01]: to come down and I started having lower
pain days, lower crazy sensation days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then slowly, but surely I started
getting pain free days and do those first
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of pain free days where I was like,
it was a teenager again, like it never
[SPEAKER_01]: happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got your endocannabinoid system back
in line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that the rec industry has
progressed to where it is, there are
[SPEAKER_01]: several places in town where I can go in
and pick up half THC half CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like when I get home from the end of a
long day and my knees are swollen a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit and my feet hurt and my back hurts and
I've eaten enough bowls of shit for the
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm in kind of a foul mood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two or three dabs of that will have me
feeling like none of that happened
[SPEAKER_01]: physically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just a wonder again for the day
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD for the win.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD ramble.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I brought you on for this
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go through a lot of this Doug who's been
on the episode before too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw Doug today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Doug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doug, you looked great today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to see you doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD has changed his life 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medical marijuana has saved Doug's life.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I honestly, I,
and it's, it's hard to think stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: this right now because we've lost a lot of
people this year, but I don't know if Doug
[SPEAKER_01]: could still be here without medical
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, mentally, spiritually,
and physically Doug would not be the same
[SPEAKER_02]: person without medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I saw some of the same stuff I was
going through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his world, like, I mean, listeners,
if you don't have like physical pain in
[SPEAKER_01]: your life, or if you've never really been
injured for awhile, it's kind of hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand what people who do have nerve
damage and pain like that go through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the best way I can describe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's like a sound and it gets louder
and louder and louder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as it gets louder, the world around
you gets smaller and that sound presses in
[SPEAKER_01]: on the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are some days where there's
nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that sound like it's just pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter that if you don't pick
up the phone, you're not going to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: job later.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter that you've got to go to
the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter that you had something
really important to do that day that you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to get up and go do now for,
uh, or it's, you know, you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: lose it forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: All there is, is the pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you'll do anything to get away
from it or make it stop for awhile.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll give people a ridiculous sums of
money because they claim to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and for the most part, nothing helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, like I was wearing a thing that
electrocuted me slowly, like a tens unit
[SPEAKER_01]: and it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: For some issues, but for mine,
it was literally just the electrical shock
[SPEAKER_01]: that scrambled the pain impulse on the way
to my brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that was the best that Western
science had for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then one day I had some,
uh, high CBD, um, hash and about half an
[SPEAKER_01]: hour later, I was like, wait a second,
nothing hurts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I'd kind of drum my, both my hands
on the table and I was like, and I can
[SPEAKER_01]: feel on my fingers and none of them hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did that come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where'd that guy with that violence sticky
shit go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, it, uh, CBD is absolutely
wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and a lot of people are starting to
figure it out so much so that there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of scam and fake shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, unfortunately that Chinese imported
CBD shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not real.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not buying stuff with a lab test.
[SPEAKER_01]: On it from a very accredited retailer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know what you're getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm sorry to inform you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's, uh, there's a lot of research
going on into CBD right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, hopefully in the next 10 years,
we know a lot more about its medical
[SPEAKER_01]: applications, but, uh, I can vouch for its
ability to calm a headache and lower
[SPEAKER_01]: inflammation and swelling in your nerves
or around your nerves and your joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, uh, those pain signals aren't
just abilitating produces vomiting and
[SPEAKER_02]: nausea.
[SPEAKER_02]: You feel like you're going to smoke some
CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll take that away.
[SPEAKER_02]: It suppresses seizures.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something we've talked about on the
podcast before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it'll make you not have convulsions
and seizures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, uh, that's like the most
popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone, but it's, there's a several
different forms of epilepsy that THC work
[SPEAKER_01]: on and that CBD work on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that the two together work on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good, but all that stuff's in its
infancy too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it'll, it, uh, stops here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it doesn't stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will slow down your PTSD and your
nightmares and your thoughts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, if you have PTSD, I always sleep
amazingly well when I've been consuming
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: It helps with anxiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's an anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an anti, uh, an antioxidant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It helps with degenerative disorders,
which is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's acted as a protective, an anti-tumor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll, it'll, it will not destroy your
tumors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you need THC to destroy a tumor,
slow a tumor for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's a lot of very, very,
very recent, um, cancer research on THC
[SPEAKER_01]: and CBD and CBD slows tumor growth majorly
is what they're seeing in mice trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, which is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we, if, uh, if we can slow tumor
growth, that gives us a better chance to
[SPEAKER_01]: fight it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the good news to that co or that
equation is that THC has been shown to
[SPEAKER_01]: kill it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, which is kind of where the,
you know, they're the first real medical
[SPEAKER_01]: research into Rick Simpson oil style
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that would be, it concentrates of
both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's why those are so effective in
the, um, I'm a little bit baked from that
[SPEAKER_01]: last tiny dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a dab while you ramble
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as the, the medical research that
we're starting to get, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: it really is in its infancy folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying that, uh, if you have
cancer and you find some of this,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can cure yourself real easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not what I'm saying here,
but, uh, um, the research is promising and
[SPEAKER_01]: honestly, in our lifetimes, we might see
legitimate, um, package perfectly dosed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got this kind of cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to start you on this much THC,
this much CBD style.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, in our lifetime, which would be,
Oh, that would make me so happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you smell that dab that I just took a
little bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that smells, it tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tasted a minute ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the turp ex pineapple Jack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The nug run shatter.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, another thing I wanted to mention
that, uh, CBD does, it's an
[SPEAKER_02]: antidepressant, which, you know,
I think it it's got its own antidepressant
[SPEAKER_02]: properties, but also if a dude's not
hurting every day, that's going to work as
[SPEAKER_02]: an antidepressant.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not having PTSD symptoms and
panic attacks, you're going to be less
[SPEAKER_02]: depressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, honestly, most days when I wake up
and I'm not hurting, it feels like my
[SPEAKER_01]: birthday still, cause they're pretty rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, most days I wake up at least a little
stiff, a little sore, something somewhere
[SPEAKER_01]: screaming.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're only getting older, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when I was a teenager, I had more
than one doctor go, if you don't knock
[SPEAKER_01]: this shit off, it's going to hurt when
you're 30.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, shut up, put a cast on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put a cast on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got shit to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, where'd my rollerblades go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cast off early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I got other shit to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was a teenager in Colorado in the
nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were still free to like ride our bikes
off roofs and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember like before everything was
nerfed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before kids are fucking padded bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell?
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't get trophies when our team
didn't win.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like kids are going to be a bunch of
pussies in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the last generation, the relief got
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took full advantage here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're the same age.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was right there with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, I remember more than one doctor
going, it's going to hurt when you're 30
[SPEAKER_01]: and dude, they were all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but the days that are paying free,
most of those I can credit to last night I
[SPEAKER_01]: was, I was hurting a little, I knew I was
hurting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I consumed a whole lot of THC CBD
concentrate instead of my normal mix of
[SPEAKER_01]: predominantly THC flower and shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I wake up feeling a lot better,
um, really restful sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, really, really nice,
uh, work on the inflammation while I
[SPEAKER_01]: sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing we should totally mention is CBD
buyers by itself will not get you high.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you can consume a lot of CBD and you
may get a little grin, but I don't think
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to get like any psychedelic
psychoactive effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a high, the, the mood improvement
is like you were saying when the pain goes
[SPEAKER_01]: away, your mood goes up a thousand times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it, I mean, if, if you don't know
what I'm talking about, think about
[SPEAKER_01]: getting a bee sting when you get that
stinger pulled out or a splinter pulled
[SPEAKER_01]: out, or you've got a big painful zit that
finally pops, like in that relief of
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, imagine that like through your whole
arm, like if your whole arm felt like it
[SPEAKER_01]: was on fire and then one moment it stopped
feeling like that and just felt like your
[SPEAKER_01]: arm again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the sensation is incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we finally get there, you know how
well it's working.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, another thing, uh, that we can talk
about is CBD will reduce the effects of
[SPEAKER_02]: THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're a little too high,
if you've had too many dabs, if you're new
[SPEAKER_02]: and you take a big giant dab of THC and
you're just spinning, you're fucked up,
[SPEAKER_02]: you take a little dab of CBD and it will
calm you down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll balance out your high.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a, some company that made a
product, they were calling it rescue pills
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was just a CBD caps, CBD filled gel
cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, to yeah, if you're, your buddy took
too many dabs and they're freaking out a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit, just hand them this and,
and you know, give them a hug for half an
[SPEAKER_01]: hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait for this to kick in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some Doritos and he'd be just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, a friend of mine makes, uh,
for a relative of his that he's a
[SPEAKER_01]: caregiver for, he makes CBD capsules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and he does something to the oil to
make it a little more bio available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was taking those at night for a
while while I had a few and oh good Lord,
[SPEAKER_01]: did I feel wonderful the next day?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just pain free in, in just in a
really, really nice mood.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a couple of companies that are
making CBD dog treats, which I think is
[SPEAKER_02]: really cool because a lot of the shepherd
breeds are known for their dysplasia and
[SPEAKER_02]: hip problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, there's a shepherd dog that stayed at
my house for a little while now and he
[SPEAKER_02]: gets some CBD treats occasionally and he
seems to be a happy little dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't seem to cause him any problems and
it's going to keep him pain free,
[SPEAKER_02]: keep his little hips happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got, uh, um, a Malamute that's,
uh, pushing four or 13 and a half now
[SPEAKER_01]: she's almost 14.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, breed expect life expectancy is eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so her knees, her, her ankles,
uh, basically every joint is shot and you
[SPEAKER_01]: can see when she doesn't want to go up and
down the stairs, I've been adding a little
[SPEAKER_01]: THC CBD tincture to her food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and the days that I add it,
she's five years younger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you can see it helping with the pain
and the inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, it takes about 20 minutes,
half an hour to kick in for her and you
[SPEAKER_01]: can see the change overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had five or six customers come in
looking for something for their dogs
[SPEAKER_01]: before I thought to try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I'm glad I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are companies that are making
specific edibles for dogs now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, there are things available at hemp
stores that have CBD for your dog that are
[SPEAKER_02]: made in America with actual hemp products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there, I, uh, can't say there's
anything wrong with that as long as it's
[SPEAKER_02]: made with real, real hemp or real
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, basically if it's sold in a brick
and mortar retailer in the United States,
[SPEAKER_01]: it has to at least, uh, contain what the
label says.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, recently the, the DEA just sent out a
thing to a bunch of CBD only companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and the internet kind of freaked out
and was like, Oh, they're just attacking
[SPEAKER_01]: weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they always do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, they were targeting the people
that are selling like codfish oil and
[SPEAKER_01]: calling it CBD oil because people don't
know any better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't take this stuff to a lab and
get it tested as a civilian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you're just getting scammed out of
money on the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be careful if you're ordering online
folks, but this, uh, the, if you've got a
[SPEAKER_01]: number of different ailments, um,
you should get online and check out and
[SPEAKER_01]: see if there's any research on what THC
and CBD can do for those for your specific
[SPEAKER_02]: ailment.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then check out the laws in your state
and see if, if and where you can get this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have to come take a vacation in
Colorado, I see a lot of the people doing
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come, they visit at one of our rec
stores and a good rec store will have a
[SPEAKER_01]: decent selection of CBD products at this
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they might not have a huge selection
or a wide selection, but they should have
[SPEAKER_01]: some, so you can go to more than one store
while you're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll find what you need to check out
weed maps.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can check out Leafley.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are menus available to see what you
want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately on the mobile apps,
they cannot show you pricing anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they take that off the mobile?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the pricing has gone on all the mobile
apps, but you can still find them on the
[SPEAKER_02]: web.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you use your computer, it's a weed maps
.com and Leafley L E A F L Y.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're coming to Colorado, I think
those are effective in all the marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: states.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pretty much nationwide now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to search for locations of
your favorite, favorite strains or
[SPEAKER_02]: products or topicals or whatever you're
looking for, go to those websites and you
[SPEAKER_02]: can find information on the products
you're looking for and you can find
[SPEAKER_02]: specific locations that have them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, don't get mad at me if a dispensary
does not update their weed maps menu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes they forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I was about to say is like weed maps
and Leafley are great places to start your
[SPEAKER_01]: search.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're looking for a very specific
product, um, or even kind of a general
[SPEAKER_01]: product, you're looking for something with
a certain ratio of cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: some THC, some CBD, something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, check out weed maps for Leafley,
make a list of possible shops and then go
[SPEAKER_01]: ahead and give them a call and just a real
quick ask them, Hey, what's your,
[SPEAKER_01]: your selection of blah?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you have in for CBD options right
now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have black pickpens?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like be specific in what you're
looking for as much as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then, uh, narrow your list that
way because I mean the industry is weird
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you never know when somebody's
going to walk in and say, give me all of
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, what's on their menu might not
have anything to do with what's on their
[SPEAKER_01]: store shelf at this moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might just be stuff that's been on the
store shelf in the last 30 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was shopping at green and healthy the
other day and I was frustrated because I
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted, uh, I bought something and the guy
behind me was frustrated because I'd
[SPEAKER_02]: purchased all of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, I want that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she had to say it's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, why is it on the list?
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's like, he just bought all of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully she can sell out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought an ounce and I cleaned them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took the bottom of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched a dude by 160 things,
a hard candies one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it was just like, okay,
let me get you a box and, and sweep all of
[SPEAKER_01]: these into the box.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like for the rest of the week,
we had to tell people, sorry, we're out of
[SPEAKER_01]: that particular product line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were like, is there something
wrong with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, no, it was something
amazing with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, honestly, every, every month
I've worked in a dispensary that's
[SPEAKER_01]: happened with at least one product line.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, sometimes it's only the last eight
or 10 or 20 units or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to go to, you went with me,
we went to the clinic in Denver and they
[SPEAKER_02]: had Durbin poison wax and they had vortex
wax.
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved from the clinic on Mexico in
Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still open.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have these products anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've changed their game, but they used
to have, the vortex tasted like
[SPEAKER_02]: cranberries and dirty feet and rotten
fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why you like that feet smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just love that in my weed, but the high
that it gave me, I couldn't focus on
[SPEAKER_02]: anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made my eyes jump around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was on a bumpy road.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was really crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that Durbin poison just, I love the
flavor of good Durbin poison wax.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that head high is just so amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So back in the day we'd go to the clinic
and I would save up as much money as I
[SPEAKER_02]: could afford to save up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd walk in there and I'd say,
how much of that Durbin poison do you
[SPEAKER_02]: have?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'd say, there's about 14 grams and
I'd say, I'll take it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'd say, how much of that vortex
do you have?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'd usually have somewhere between
14 and 28 grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would buy it and I would clean it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the guy behind me would be like,
oh yeah, he bought a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want some.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'd be like, sorry, he bought all
of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I did it the other day with those
delicious truffles.
[SPEAKER_02]: They cut me off eventually.
[SPEAKER_02]: They thought I was flipping it,
but I was really, I was smoking that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The place was two and a half hours away
from my house at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to go stock up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the last four boxes of coda and I
watched the lady behind me come in and go,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, do you guys still have those
truffles?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoopsie.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so forgive the shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they don't have something that they did
have advertised on their weed maps menu,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah, a good shop's going to keep that
mostly updated, but you're going to want
[SPEAKER_01]: to call and double check.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something, a pro tip.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't say pro tip ever, but if you want
to sound like you know what you're talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about, don't say CBDs, say CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cat, boy, dog are the initials.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not an apostrophe S or S.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way I look at it, you don't say THC's.
[SPEAKER_02]: This strain has a lot of THC's in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You say this strain has a lot of THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would you say this strain has a lot of
CBDs?
[SPEAKER_01]: In all fairness to the American public,
like Sanjay Gupta fucked that up on his
[SPEAKER_01]: weed special.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I didn't catch that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't realize it was Sanjay that did
that to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it wasn't him that started it,
but like it's a common mispronunciation or
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, mispronunciation would be correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just CBD, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't say I want a glass of waters.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just say I want a glass of water and
you know that there's a lot of water in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a measurement that contains a
specific amount of water and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking for CBD, not CBDs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's not a group of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you don't say CHCs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't say corns.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want some corns.
[SPEAKER_02]: You say I want some corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't eat cereals, you eat cereal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's one of those things we hear that
like Sadova and Indigo that when you hear
[SPEAKER_02]: CBDs, you just cringe.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do an episode in the future
about Sativa and Indica and the
[SPEAKER_02]: differences and the benefits and balances
and the growing styles and everything of
[SPEAKER_02]: each.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll talk about Sadova and Indigo's.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sativa and Indica, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And phenotype, P-H-E-N-O-T-Y-P-E,
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: While we're on it's strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to do that one?
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw a hilarious post the other day on
social media that was like, I love all
[SPEAKER_01]: those 90% THC strands out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just about died laughing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to my boy, Cooper Watts.
[SPEAKER_02]: He made a short educational video on the
difference between strain and strand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strands are ropes or fibers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strands are different varieties of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to be technical, you can call
it a varietal or a cultivar, but let's go
[SPEAKER_02]: with strain instead of strand as a start,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's trichome and not trichrome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get that one a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've gone on long enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because knowing is half the battle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of battle, that was a good segue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of battle, I wanted to talk about
Nate Diaz.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the UFC in UFC 202.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good segue.
[SPEAKER_01]: G-I-J-O reference right to Nate Diaz.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Real American hero.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to talk about my opinion of
the fight.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: But those dudes threw the fuck down.
[SPEAKER_02]: They went to the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: It ended with them both standing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they beat the shit out of each other
for 25 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They beat the living fuck out of each
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see the fight, but I did see the
press conference we're about to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And holy shit, he looked like a side of
beef getting ready to hit the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, he got punched in the face a
lot of times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Conor McGregor has got some punches.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one thing I want to talk about when
they're interviewing him, dude just
[SPEAKER_02]: straight pulls out a vape pen and starts
taking vape pen rips.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the, I've got the video here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just play this video.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only a couple of seconds long here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to play this video and then
we'll talk for a couple of seconds and
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll wrap up this podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm going to kind of fuck up the
volume.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the pen he pulls out, just so you guys
know, if you haven't seen the video,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's your standard concentrate vape pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a million different versions of
this on the store shelf I work at.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to bring the volume up slowly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to start back here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it comes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here comes the part we want to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: What exactly are you, just for the record,
smoking?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is True.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the True Company.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: It helps with the healing process and
inflammation and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you want to get these before or after
the fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's trending.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes your life a better place.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then one last one.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD oil, if you don't know what that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: A big part of this story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you hear that?
[SPEAKER_02]: The key right there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Make your life a better place.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what he said.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD can make your life a better place.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't have said it better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I didn't realize it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've watched this video several times.
[SPEAKER_02]: He fucked up where he said, it's good to
use before and after the fight.
[SPEAKER_02]: He shouldn't have said before the fight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucked up right there, buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But still.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he might be in a ton of trouble for
doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I wanted to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The specific rules, bar, cannabis
consumption period until six hours after
[SPEAKER_01]: the fight is what I was reading in random
press coverage of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't follow the sports.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense in all of their rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you didn't catch that from my intro to
this story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that USATO rules or is that rules from
the local governing sporting agency?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was rules with an S in the news article
I read.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost said rules with a Z, but I
honestly don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's rules they are, but MMA fighters
can't use any sort of cannabis product or
[SPEAKER_01]: any sort of banned substance, which
marijuana or cannabis products would be on
[SPEAKER_01]: the list until six hours after the fight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure I already know your answer
here, but do you think a dude that just
[SPEAKER_02]: spent 25 minutes of his night getting
kicked in the dick and punched in the face
[SPEAKER_02]: should be allowed to take a couple of rips
off a CBD vape pen at the end of the
[SPEAKER_02]: night?
[SPEAKER_01]: Most assuredly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd offer him a dab of this wonderful half
and half.
[SPEAKER_01]: After a beating like that, anything that's
going to help you recover faster and deal
[SPEAKER_01]: with that level of trauma is encouraged by
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says it reduces inflammation and
swelling.
[SPEAKER_02]: That dude, his face looked like a
jack-o-lantern.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I applaud his use of anything
other than heavy narcotics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that what they usually throw at him?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what they do to deal with the
pain at the end of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nate Diaz did make a joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, I'm going to a party and Conor
McGregor is going to the hospital.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how accurate that was because
Nate Diaz looked like he had his face
[SPEAKER_02]: punched in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even talk about who I feel like
won that fight.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't matter at all on this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not what we're here for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I know is that Nate Diaz took a hell
of a beating and that during the press
[SPEAKER_01]: conference, he was ripping a CBD pen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, blatantly ripping it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: He took two or three big fat rips off of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't cough.
[SPEAKER_02]: He took it like I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he took it like a champ.
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't smoke cigarettes all day,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I thought that was the key to his
success was tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what makes him the MMA fighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes him tough as nails.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where the nickname Wheezy comes
from, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they call him Young Wheezy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like almost everybody should be
allowed to consume CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody should be allowed to consume
CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whedikit was about last night,
the new episode that aired was medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana use in the NFL to deal with the
chronic concussion syndrome or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: it's called.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it helps.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a victim of a head injury.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about that 42 minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: That CBD changed my life and it helped me
get out of my funk that I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the episode wasn't focused on CBD,
but that's sort of what they were inching
[SPEAKER_01]: at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of the story they were telling was
THC and CBD are both neuroprotectants.
[SPEAKER_02]: My next question was going to be,
do you think that cannabis use is a
[SPEAKER_02]: performance enhancing drug?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's this performance?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fighting, kicking people, fighting,
UFC fighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about football?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not performance enhancing at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about basketball?
[SPEAKER_02]: Injury recovery enhancing.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about basketball?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm trying to play devil's advocate
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about video games?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like when I smoke I haven't played
video games in a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of things where I would put
it on the yes list.
[SPEAKER_02]: But see then in my mind, since I am so
comfortable, I've got ADD, my mind
[SPEAKER_02]: wanders.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can tell by listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mind just fucking darts around all over
the damn place.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I smoke some hash, it does help me
focus a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a moment there for the first
fucking 10 minutes where my brain just
[SPEAKER_02]: spins, but once it lands back in its
place, I'm pretty well focused.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've got mild ADD as well and
that's one of the things I've always
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoyed about cannabis is it helps slow
down the sporadicness of the thoughts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I can shoot pool better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can shoot basketball better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't play football.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could probably throw my football with
more accuracy after I took a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a musician.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've played drums for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had drum lessons.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been on tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've played in big bands.
[SPEAKER_02]: I played in small bands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes smoking a little weed makes me
play a little better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes smoking a little weed fucks me
up to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely alters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you're talking about just helping
the athlete or the performer tune out
[SPEAKER_01]: other distractions and focus on the
competition in the moment, I don't see it
[SPEAKER_01]: making you run faster and jump higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I think of when I think of
performance enhancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're packing yourself full of blood so
that your heart can move more oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, taking more testosterone so I'm
faster, meaner, leaner, quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, a steroid so that you have more
physical muscle mass, but THC doesn't do
[SPEAKER_01]: any of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis doesn't do any of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't make me able to kick you in the
face any harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't make me give you more damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps me recover from that face kick
faster, but that's not a performance
[SPEAKER_01]: enhancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a recovery enhancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, if I was the UFC fighter and we're
gearing up for the fight and the music's
[SPEAKER_02]: going and Rogan's all out there,
oh my God, this is the fight of the
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking night, everybody, and Rogan's just
going nuts with his bald head and his
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking too much alpha brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does your mouthpiece have a little dab,
a dab mouthpiece attachment to it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a fighter, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a UFC fighter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my fucking hand wraps on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my tape coming on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my gloves on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my ankle wraps on because I got
these long chicken legs, and they come out
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're like, Ross and Jeff,
you got to fight in 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You ready for your pre-show dab?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, let's get it, and they drop me
like a half a gram of some pineapple jack
[SPEAKER_02]: nug run shatter on there, and I blow it
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I want to do after that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not fight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how these do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you medicate and want to fight at
all?
[SPEAKER_01]: See, this is how little MMA I watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you can manipulate the rig because
they need their fingers to grapple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking boxing style where you
can't hold the rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got one manager holding up the
smoke buddy, one manager holding up the
[SPEAKER_01]: rig, another manager working the nail on
the carb cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: That seems complicated for a pre-fight
dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would use one of those, the Hitman hinge
nails with the D-nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can do it with one hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can do it with my glove on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The announcer's microphone comes down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff's rig comes down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am one of those guys that if there's a
dab to be taken, I will make sure it
[SPEAKER_02]: happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the dab giver.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad we got to work the Nate Diaz clip
into this episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw that and I was so blown away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, that's got to be photoshopped.
[SPEAKER_01]: I clicked the volume on it and they start
talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was blown away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm super ballsy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Nate Diaz for representing
cannabis in a pretty cool way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right after a tough decision loss too,
he goes up all chest out proud to lead the
[SPEAKER_01]: way about medical cannabis and how
beneficial it is for people in this
position.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's in no way politically correct or
gentle.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he's just balls to the wall with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got kicked in the fucking head.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to smoke some CBD to help it
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to help.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be mad at me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But both of those brothers are going to
end up banned from the UFC and banned from
[SPEAKER_02]: fighting for life if they keep playing the
way that they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to be terrible because I
like to see their performances.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys, it is random.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a dreadlocked hippie Rastafarian
dude, but I love to watch some UFC.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think about it this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those dudes weigh 200 pounds and they're
fucking jacked.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got more testosterone in their
body than most people should have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they want to break shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad that they're in that cage
breaking each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then out at the bar or at the dab lounge
trying to break me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I condone that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to battle in that cage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's skill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jiu Jitsu.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've both known people who were just
built to brawl.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just, some people are here to drum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are here to high five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are here to brawl.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've all got our skill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's good that they have an outlet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a fan of MMA.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't care enough to pay attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I am accidentally an MMA fan
because of Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because of Joey Diaz and it all rubbed
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just rubs off Eddie Bravo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too many Joe Rogan experiences.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rogan puts out the fight companion tour,
him and a bunch of his friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also listened to fighter and the
kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's more MMA that gets pumped into
my head, but they put out a fight
[SPEAKER_02]: companion where two guys from fighter and
the kid and Eddie Bravo and Joe Rogan sit
[SPEAKER_02]: around and they watch the UFC and they
talk about what's going on and they drink
[SPEAKER_02]: beer and smoke weed and get fucked up and
talk shit to each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're watching the UFC and they tell
you like in the match, they're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: all right, round three of this match,
we were at 29, 28, 27 seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can sync up your computer and
watch that video.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's almost weirdly like you're
hanging out with Rogan and the crew
[SPEAKER_01]: watching the fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll watch it if it's on somewhere I'm at,
but I don't like actively pay attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pay more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I'm over at your house and it's on
the, it'll get more attention out of me
[SPEAKER_01]: than like football or basketball would.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took a little karate when I was a
youngster.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've always been fascinated with that
type of skills to Kung Fu Sansu for
[SPEAKER_02]: several years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Kong su do karate for even
longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just impressed that he was repping
CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I liked that he had a little CBD
vape pen that was set up like an open or
[SPEAKER_01]: any of the other major vape companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, just ripping on some CBD oil took like
two or three good, maybe three or four
[SPEAKER_02]: good rips.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Mike, we've been rambling for
almost an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's time to wrap up this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you miss any other points on CBD?
[SPEAKER_01]: We covered this basic medical
applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I crossed out all the stuff on my
list, except popular CBD strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that if people wanted to grow cannabis,
that was high in CBD, um, just a few
[SPEAKER_02]: strains, I would recommend anything,
uh, Harlequin, Kanatonic, Harla Sue,
[SPEAKER_01]: Tora Sue, Tora Bora, ACDC.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Tora Bora is really wonderful folks
that I've had a lot of personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know I went over that list really
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were just off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the other thing I'd like to touch on,
I think before we wrap this one up is,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, um, for at least for the pain and
inflammation that I'm dealing with.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC and CBD together in roughly 50,
50 mix work two or 300 times better than
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD alone or THC alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the two of them together works.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not one plus one equals two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's one plus one equals seven,
as far as I'm concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the effect is amplified greatly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool ass math.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, no, it's wonderful when you,
when you mix THC and CBD, the medical
[SPEAKER_01]: applications are wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, sorry if I sound a little stoned and I
am pretty tired, but, uh, I feel clear
[SPEAKER_01]: headed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel, um, like alert and present.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that wasn't true when I got here,
I was hurting so bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, uh, I seriously almost didn't come
folks and I really like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't almost didn't come cause my
head was pounding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you made it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you pulled through.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad those CBD dabs fixed you up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have just started dabbing CBD
earlier in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, uh, I was out and about and didn't
get a chance all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how life goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you got to get home and get the
dab rig going, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remind everybody how they can fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Follow you on social media and absolutely
remind us about your Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can catch me on Pueblo for sensible
cannabis laws on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give us a like, comment, share.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're, uh, reaching more and more people
every week on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, uh, I mean, the viewers that I get
per week spike and change topic to topic,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, uh, as we've been getting closer to
the election, the view counts been going
[SPEAKER_01]: up steady.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been nice.

[SPEAKER_02]: You've been listening to the podcast since
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see those messages, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see all of those messages.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, if you send me a message,
and I have not responded to your message
[SPEAKER_02]: yet, I'm getting to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do one episode a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get 20 messages a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have tried to filter out my favorite or
the most relevant for what's going on in
[SPEAKER_02]: our lives right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I handle the emails.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll be back with more episodes with
more email content.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the listener generated content.
[SPEAKER_02]: That lets me know that I'm getting the
information to the people that need the
[SPEAKER_02]: information.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm giving them exactly what they want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes me feel great.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, uh, we know way too much about
cannabis folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We spend hours debating which little
nugget of our our, our vast cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: intellect to share with the listeners this
night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, uh, when we have an email that's
like, Hey, I was wondering how to blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, uh, it sparks some awesome
conversations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of my favorite episodes, man,
our, uh, listeners with specific grow
[SPEAKER_01]: questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be able to dig in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be going through the phone and I'll
get an email and it'll say show question
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'll read it and you can see me light
up like, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause now I get to ramble for 45 minutes
about one of my favorite things and it'll
[SPEAKER_02]: a whole bunch about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it always makes me good to get those
messages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, from where we are in
Colorado, especially here in Pueblo,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's hard to understand what you need to
know now in Florida or Georgia or wherever
[SPEAKER_01]: you have in Australia, we have listeners
all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so you send it in a question that
lets us know where you're at and how we
[SPEAKER_01]: can help you helps us clue in on the
information to give you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I absolutely love those episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much fun to do the last two
email, uh, episodes.

to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get so many messages that it's honestly
overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody told me to hire an intern.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said that that would be bullshit because
it's all about talking to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want to talk to my intern.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want a pre-typed answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to actually communicate with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do my best to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to keep up with it guys.

[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, thank you for coming, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to for the CBD episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's honestly what the final decision
maker for leaving the house and coming
[SPEAKER_01]: over and doing the show was, I wanted to
do another good episode about CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Myself and Doug did one a while back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and I've had Fox on a couple of times
also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you've done two with Fox.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Kabuki J.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fox.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're on CBD crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was who I was hinting at when you
said, let's do a CBD episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, do we want a third?
[SPEAKER_01]: You were like, no, let's just do a you and
me show.
[SPEAKER_02]: He lives in Denver now, so it's harder to
get with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the CBD go-to that I know of down
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I have a CBD question, that's who I
send a message to.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys have CBD questions or any
other questions, please hit us up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions at all, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get out of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for us to take some fat dads.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to my ninja Spence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And until next time, take a fat dad and
give your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to aim for the sky, now we higher
than Mars.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the rise till we shine like the fire of
stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Son, I create.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're
[SPEAKER_00]: the slammin' beats, makes the whole house
wanna bounce like static sheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We the track elite, world star athletes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't compete, cause your rap is
weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a seat.
[SPEAKER_00]: My numbers game is uncontained by a data
sheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run the game while you drag your feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm unashamed with my love for fame,
cause my life was mundane, now it's
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling magnifique.
[SPEAKER_00]: First place, and we moving the ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't stop what I do with the pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make the impossible probable and do it
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the beginning, true to the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Constantly winning, all you do is defend.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the lab, writing theories of rhyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly defined, dedicating serious time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't seek what you're weary to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't copy what you hear me design.
[SPEAKER_00]: My whole life's a rhyme on the page.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of enraged that I've spent
minimal time on the stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't wanna play myself like some
five minute craze.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was a phase, I'd probably put a night
in my face and go plow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blow out my whole brain like Cobain,
the moment that he realized he sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But fuck depression, I ain't fixing to
fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'ma come with progression and I'll give
it my all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it again, do it then, do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the moment that you stop is when the
movement will end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do it again, do it then, do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give a fuck who the truth will offend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go do it, go do it then, do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loyal to music, no
[SPEAKER_00]: running.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pretend you do it while I do it
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can pretend you do it while I do it
again.
