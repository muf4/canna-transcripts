[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 377 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by the
Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company and you can find them at dankseed
.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start the podcast off by letting
you know what I'm dabbing on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a nice little buffet of Viola
Labs concentrates in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with this SFV OG Chem De
La Chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like this because of the
diesel-y, dirty, funky, fuel-y smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm giving it a smell right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a hint of diesel fuel to it and
then that SFV OG in there gives it that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of fuel-y, feed-y kind of thing and I
really like that aroma a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next on the list is the TKLA.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one smells great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm cracking it open right now to give it
a smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that earthiness to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little bit of a gassiness to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not as extreme on the diesel turp as the
SFV, but it certainly does have a fuel-y,
[SPEAKER_00]: earthy sort of a aroma to it and the TKLA
packs quite a punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one kind of put me to sleep last
night so I'm loving the TKLA and then if
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to go by flavor, this next one
would be my favorite in terms of flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Tropicana Cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, as soon as you crack it open,
I get a hint of grapefruits followed by a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of maybe bubbly champagne or
maybe a hint of pineapples now that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: smelling it up real close.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a hint of pineapples and
grapefruits in here and as it lingers on
[SPEAKER_00]: my nose, I smell sort of a sweet candy,
maybe a sweet tart sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a nice variety of concentrates
from our friends at Viola Labs today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to pick a favorite out of all
three of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that SFV, OG, Chem De La Chem blend
because of that gassy, decently sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma and that aftertaste that it leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love the Tropicana Cookies
because of that sweet grapefruit pineapple
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of flavor and then it just leaves a
candy-coated layer on your tongue,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that TKLA, it lacked in flavor,
but it really punched me with the potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are all three winners in my book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Viola Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been doing a great job lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm staring at this package on my
table and I just realized that no matter
[SPEAKER_00]: which way I turn this, this says Viola
upside down or right side up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great job with the creative logo there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm honestly not sure if it's Viola or
Viola.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was recently told that it was named
after one of the people's grandmother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to get your name correctly,
but everywhere I go, if I say Viola in a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary, they correct me and say it's
Viola.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I start by saying Viola, they correct
me and say it's Viola.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm always wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know the proper way to say it,
but big shout out to your company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing a great job with the
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do approve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be back for more.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I'm talking about this great
concentrate, I should mention where I
[SPEAKER_00]: picked it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grabbed this at the Colorado Cannabis
Exchange at the south end of Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friends at the
Colorado Cannabis Exchange for always
[SPEAKER_00]: taking super good care of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, they do not pay me to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not sponsor me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not endorse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just super great to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I go in there, they treat me
with kindness.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're super patient, and they always
know what to recommend for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out and a big fist bump to the
whole crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one that got me super talkative
out of that mess was the Tropicana
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other two were kind of more on the
mellow side.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Tropicana Cookies lifted my head up
and made me super talkative again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, this will not be a long episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a Thursday episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been spoiling you guys with two
episodes every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to cut back on episodes,
but I'm going to do a couple of short
[SPEAKER_00]: Thursday episodes for a couple of weeks
while I get a few things handled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am just busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to stop doing podcasting at
all, but the Thursday shows may get a
[SPEAKER_00]: little shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Monday shows will stay long,
intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be in-depth grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for Thursdays, we may goof off for a
couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have some fun in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's read some current iTunes customer
ratings and reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to leave an iTunes customer
review, I would appreciate your review and
[SPEAKER_00]: I will read it on a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: To leave a review, it's really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're listening on your iPhone,
go to the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the most current episodes and scroll
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you scroll up, the opportunity to write
a review will pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just click on there, write a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you click on write a review,
the first thing it does is give you the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to click an amount of stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on the amount of stars you feel I
deserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, most folks have left five star
reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten one one-star review.
[SPEAKER_00]: We read that on the show earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today we've got a three-star review.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will get into that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But please leave the amount of stars you
feel I deserve and type in an honest
[SPEAKER_00]: review and I will read your review on a
future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're listening to the podcast on a
computer and you are using iTunes and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd like to leave a customer review,
go to the podcast tab in iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says music and movies and TV shows and
podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on where it says podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once you get to the podcast screen,
you need to click on the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you search for the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The search bar is on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you click on the podcast tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you were on the podcast page,
the ratings and reviews tab will be very
[SPEAKER_00]: easy to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is right next to the show logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ratings and reviews will pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you are able to leave the
amount of stars you feel are appropriate
[SPEAKER_00]: and you will be able to type in your
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get into some of the most recent
iTunes customer reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our first iTunes customer review is left
by people that call themselves Stone Blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline says informative and fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: They left us a five-star review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our rating, it says thank you Rasta Jeff
for your informative and fun podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife and I have made it sort of a
ritual to listen to your podcast while
[SPEAKER_00]: we're tending our garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time in the garden together has
strengthened our relationship and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: happy to have you as a part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: She usually doesn't like to listen to
podcasts, but after a few episodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: she warmed up to it quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: As growers ourselves, we encourage our
friends to start their own garden and we
[SPEAKER_00]: recently turned them on to your grow
lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few have taken our suggestion and it's
easier than going to their house and
[SPEAKER_00]: walking them through everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, Timothy Green Thumbs and
Dreadhead Martha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Timothy Green Thumbs and Dreadhead
Martha, it is an honor to be in your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an honor to be contributing to your
relationship and helping you two build a
[SPEAKER_00]: bond together while building a bond with
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an awesome iTunes review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also appreciate that you were sharing
the show with other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me, a great way for
the show to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow is by word of mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you were doing a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the great support and thank you
for sharing the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of funny that you say it's
easier than going to their house because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's part of what started me recording a
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got tired of telling the same speech
over and over on how to do stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just started recording it and posting
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when people ask me the same question,
I can say, hey, just go listen to episode
[SPEAKER_00]: 315 and you can learn about mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad that you got the same idea and
you were sharing the show so that people
[SPEAKER_00]: can learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Timothy Green Thumbs and Dreadhead
Martha, I look forward to catching you at
[SPEAKER_00]: a show this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for the great iTunes customer
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next customer review comes from
somebody we have heard from before.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person calls themselves Yolo Grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They left us a three star review.
[SPEAKER_00]: The title of their review is White Mike
and their iTunes customer review goes like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think ninety nine percent of your
listeners are here for grow information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be great if you stop bringing
White Mike on the show so we don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis related or not, it's still
politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you have to convince your
listeners to be pro cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We obviously all are pro cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, let me thank you for the
customer review and thank you for
[SPEAKER_00]: listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're obviously listening to quite a few
episodes if you are catching the Mike
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm grateful that you're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm grateful that you're part of the crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm grateful that you are enjoying most of
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: As for not liking the episodes with Mike,
the podcast is free and you can always
[SPEAKER_00]: skip the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can recommend the Dude Grow show,
the Adam Dunn show, or you can always try
[SPEAKER_00]: to listen to Cannabis Cultivation and
Science with Tad Hussie if you need more
[SPEAKER_00]: grow knowledge while I'm not doing a grow
lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, let me point out that the point of
the show is cannabis news, education and
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just because we're not talking about
growing cannabis doesn't mean that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to learn something, that there's
not something valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, just because there's not something
valuable for you in that lesson doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: mean that a lot of people are enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So however much I do appreciate your
review, I'm not going to change anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike is one of my best friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike is a valuable resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be quite honest with you,
several people request more episodes with
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look forward to hearing from Mike on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an out loud invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Mike, whenever you want to come on my
show, brother, you are always fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seat across from me, that is yours,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come be on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike number two is for you whenever you
are free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Yolo Grower, unfortunately,
this isn't going to work out for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have Mike on the podcast
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like he is a valuable resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like educating and informing our
community is an important thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've got a large audience and
part of my responsibility is to educate
[SPEAKER_00]: and invoke people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want people to vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want people to support cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say that obviously all of us are pro
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage people to listen to my show
with people who are not cannabis friendly
[SPEAKER_00]: so that we can possibly sway them to be
cannabis friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sorry you don't like, you know
what, I'm not even sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too bad you don't like some of the
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish you would have more of an open mind
and you would learn to enjoy those
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes with Mike because honestly,
there is some gold hidden in those
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are skipping them, you're missing
some good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry you couldn't hang out with us for
the good times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yolo Grower, I hope everything goes well
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you still listen to the episodes
without Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to your next review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure I'm going to hear from you
sometime soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep doing what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will never slow me down.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's move on to the next
iTunes customer review.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next review comes from somebody who
calls themselves Supasha.
[SPEAKER_00]: They left us a five star rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline says this podcast is for you
and the review goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are anything like myself and have a
desire to learn how to grow, this show is
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the best ways period.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the basics all the way to his latest
grow lessons, Jeff's knowledge and passion
[SPEAKER_00]: resonate through the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Supasha, thank you for the great
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you're listening to the grow
lessons and I'm glad that they're helping
[SPEAKER_00]: you out and I'm glad that you see my
passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of love for the cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of love for people and I
want people to grow the best cannabis they
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a podcast is one of the best ways
to effectively teach people how to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: because knowledge changes every day in the
cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can do updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can teach you what I've learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can share my knowledge without having to
write a book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like by the time you finish writing
a book, you run it through all the
[SPEAKER_00]: processes, the publishers, the editors.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time that book comes out,
it's pretty much outdated and all of your
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge needs to be rewritten with a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can record an episode the day I learned
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get it out and get all that fresh
content right to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for enjoying the podcast and
thank you for learning with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never enjoyed school, but I always
enjoyed learning new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having a different way of learning
things was always great to me and finding
[SPEAKER_00]: podcasts and different avenues of
absorbing knowledge without sitting in a
[SPEAKER_00]: classroom and listening to some teacher
drone on about crap I didn't care about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like learning through podcasts and
things like that were a great option and
[SPEAKER_00]: an opportunity for a person with a brain
like mine who is always inquisitive,
[SPEAKER_00]: but doesn't have any desire to sit in a
classroom and be still and listen to a
[SPEAKER_00]: lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that also makes me understand
how to teach people in a different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't teach in a traditional way because
I don't learn in a traditional way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since I've got some weird ADD or
boredom or whatever, I feel like I can
[SPEAKER_00]: keep people's attention who also suffer
from the ADD or the boredom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get you learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can suck you in and you don't get bored
listening to the grow lessons and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you're able to absorb the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll laugh a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end, it doesn't feel like you
were just beat up by some lecturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Super Shaw, after a long ramble,
thank you for a great iTunes review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also thank you for noticing my passion
for cannabis and also my passion for
[SPEAKER_00]: teaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's partly my duty to teach
people about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was blessed to absorb a lot of knowledge
about the cannabis plant very quickly at a
[SPEAKER_00]: young age.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was also very blessed to be involved in
the cannabis industry as it bloomed around
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it is my job and part of my
karma to go and teach as much as I can
[SPEAKER_00]: about this plant and to shine as much
positive light on this plant as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does mean a lot to me when people
notice my passion and my desire to teach
[SPEAKER_00]: and my drive behind this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So extra thanks for noticing that,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's move on to our final
iTunes customer review for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This last review comes from a person who
calls themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: 7-8-9-4-5-4-8-7-9-8-2-3-1-2-3.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very specific name.
[SPEAKER_00]: They left this review on December 10th.
[SPEAKER_00]: They left me a five-star review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the title of their review is Full Melt
Six Star Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a hash joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do approve their saying that this
podcast is full melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will leave no funky residuals on the
nail and everything will burn clear and it
[SPEAKER_00]: will taste great.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Six Star Full Melt Podcasting
right here, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the headline.
[SPEAKER_00]: The review goes on to say, I love dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very irrelevant to the show, but since you
said Full Melt Six Star Podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't be mad at you about anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love dabs and you approve of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out and thanks for the five-star
customer review from our new friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: 7-8-9-4-5-4-8-7-9-8-2-3-1-2-3.

[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, I would appreciate it if
you leave a customer review on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world, I told you at
the top of the show that this was going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a short episode.
