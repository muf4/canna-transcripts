[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time for episode number 143 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_04]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, if you're a new grower,
if you're a professional grower,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you're a new smoker or a dedicated
dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or
[SPEAKER_04]: even someone who's just curious about the
current state of cannabis, this,
[SPEAKER_04]: my friends, is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm your host, my friends call me Ross
DeGepo, and I thank you guys again for
[SPEAKER_04]: joining me.
[SPEAKER_04]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_04]: Roots Band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to Kat, Coot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope everybody had a great 710.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope everybody enjoyed the Sunday
episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, guys, on this episode, I am joined by
Jesse Groves from the Colorado podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: We talk a whole bunch about outdoor
growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We talk a whole bunch of random stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: The episode was an hour and 20 minutes
long, so I'm not going to waste too much
[SPEAKER_04]: time here at the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to let the music play,
and in just a second, I'll be right back
[SPEAKER_04]: with Jesse Groves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hang out with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, say that again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a real thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Gunpowder terps?
[SPEAKER_02]: Gunpowder terps.
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Government mule smells like burnt
fireworks.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you meant by that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gunpowder.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was kind of confused by that statement.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, gunpowder terps.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm missing out on some shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's happening now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said I'd be right back with our friend,
Jesse, and guess what?
[SPEAKER_04]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the show, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, let's tell everybody about your
social media so that they can stalk you
[SPEAKER_04]: while they're listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where can they find you online?
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram, jessiegroves, at jessiegroves,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: At jessiegroves on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I post a couple pics a week there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glorious cannabis photography.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the most part, or just crap I find
interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think those are very similar things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have a website?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do Colorado podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are now on Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also on SoundCloud.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also on our own website at
ColoradoPodcast.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure you guys support the Colorado
podcast and my friends, Jesse on
[SPEAKER_04]: Despicable D and our boy 44.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to all those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very podcasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's loosely cannabis based.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get around to talking about weed every
now and then, but wacky and wild
[SPEAKER_02]: adventures for the most part.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the mullet of podcasting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm so using that.
[SPEAKER_04]: If your podcast had a haircut,
it would certainly have a mullet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your mic may jump out of that little clip
if you have it like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good adjustment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure you guys support his podcast,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Jesse is kind of an outdoor grow
expert.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's been on the show several times if
you've listened.
[SPEAKER_04]: He knows a lot about outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a lot about indoor growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had some outdoor questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse wants to talk a little bit about the
differences in small like basement
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivation compared to large commercial
growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll get into that also, but let's
talk about an email that I got.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got an email from a listener.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have the email on my phone right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just set the phone aside today,
but shout out to the guy that sent me an
[SPEAKER_04]: email.
[SPEAKER_04]: He asked when he's growing outdoors,
how big of a hole does he want to dig to
[SPEAKER_04]: put his plant in?
[SPEAKER_04]: I told him through an email, I told him to
listen to the show and I'd have Jesse on
[SPEAKER_04]: for more info, but I told him basically
make the hole as big as you can.
[SPEAKER_04]: What else can you tell us about that,
Jesse?
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally, over the years, I've noticed
a plant's somewhat limited, especially
[SPEAKER_02]: when it's in the ground by the size of its
container.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even, you know, the ground's a huge
container, but if your hole has a
[SPEAKER_02]: pre-mixed soil in it, the shoulders of the
plants aren't going to go too far past the
[SPEAKER_02]: edge of that hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started off with two-by-two holes and
worked up to three-by-three holes and now
[SPEAKER_02]: I do four-by-four holes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably keep going someday, five-by-five
holes.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're doing these four-by-four
holes, you're doing a four-by-four square,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Four feet wide, four feet long?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: How deep are you going?
[SPEAKER_02]: 18 inches.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to go deeper.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've learned a little bit more about the
root system of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I right in thinking that cannabis wants
to root outward instead of downward?
[SPEAKER_02]: For the most part, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it does like to go down,
especially if you're going from seed
[SPEAKER_02]: plants to get the tap root in there,
which can be extraordinary links,
[SPEAKER_02]: actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the most part, clones,
you know, they're going to reach out to
[SPEAKER_02]: the sides instead of down.
[SPEAKER_02]: A note on that, a three-foot by three-foot
hole that's 18 inches deep is 99 gallons
[SPEAKER_02]: of dirt.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a lot of damn dirt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know how many cubic feet that is?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we would have to do the math on the
size of the hole that you just said,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's five cubic feet, maybe I was
at six cubic feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's got to be more than that because
one of those Fox Farm bags is 1.75 cubic
[SPEAKER_04]: feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many of those bags do you think you're
going to take?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking a Pro-Mix belt.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was 3.8 cubic feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is how growers think in math,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lot of soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lot of root space.
[SPEAKER_04]: How big are these plants that,
in your example, how big are your plants
[SPEAKER_04]: at the end of the season?
[SPEAKER_02]: Four or five foot around, I mean all the
way around, you know, not just through one
[SPEAKER_02]: spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can't hug your plants, you can't
get your arms around them to hug them?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hell no.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of limit my plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can only get about six foot tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I was able to let them get bigger,
they'd probably end up eight, nine foot
[SPEAKER_02]: tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're limited by privacy?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's such a bitch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You do such a great outdoor grow to limit
you as a bitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to fight it real hard to keep them
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have learned a new trick, just plant
later.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plant later, huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the new trick?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super high tech?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to bend them as much,
you don't have to top as much,
[SPEAKER_04]: just take them out later in the season?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like lazy tech.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lazy tech, whoop tech.
[SPEAKER_04]: So are we in the flowering phase
officially yet, or do we still have a few
[SPEAKER_04]: days to go?
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we've still got a week or so
to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in about a week here in Colorado,
and we were doing research before the
[SPEAKER_04]: show, from coast to coast, there's only
about a half hour in sunlight photo
[SPEAKER_04]: period, in natural photo period right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were talking about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse was doing the research.
[SPEAKER_02]: In difference between what I was finding,
it was like New York, the sun was coming
[SPEAKER_02]: up at 539 in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in Los Angeles, it was coming up at
like 608 or some shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's odd.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so photo period, it's going to
start really shrinking from here on out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And first you're going to get your indica
varieties into flower, and then your more
[SPEAKER_02]: sativa varieties will follow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, your flow and blueberry,
those are really going to start taking off
[SPEAKER_04]: right in the next week or so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone in Colorado that grows flow,
that bitch is going to go into flower real
[SPEAKER_04]: hard here in about a week, 10 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: She'll be spitting out calyxes real soon
for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll see pistols in like 20 days,
I bet.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plant later, which is such a ridiculous
solution for easy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been my goal lately is just
K-I-S-S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it simple, stoner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the size of your plant, sorry,
I keep clearing the throat, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're taking some dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about these dabs for a brief
second.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was dunking my dabber into 90% THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is 91% THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a distillate from our friends at Evo
Lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I take the 90% distillate that's
on my dabber, and I dunk that into pure
[SPEAKER_04]: turpenoids of ghost train haze,
also made by our friends at Evo Labs.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is amazing, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is one of the best highs you can get.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first couple of times I saw you smoke
this, I got stupid high.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just goofy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried to go back to work and I pretty
much just ended up doing stuff on the
[SPEAKER_04]: computer for the next hour because I was
like, yeah, metric needs to be updated
[SPEAKER_04]: somehow because I got to sit down in a
chair for a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: But shout out to the dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why my throat's a little bit
clogged.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do apologize for being so congested
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, those OG Kush dabs were heavenly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's delicious, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got OG Ghost Train haze turps and OG
Kush turps.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then a couple of nights ago,
I took some of this 120 micron blue sherb
[SPEAKER_04]: fresh frozen solventless hash and I rolled
out a little piece into a taco shell and I
[SPEAKER_04]: put some, what did I have?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was cactus cooler, a live resin on top
of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I smeared that on like taco sauce.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I took a piece of Durbin poison
shatter and rolled it into a little snake
[SPEAKER_04]: and put that in the middle like some taco
meat.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I dunked the dabber into the 90%
THC distillate and had that on the dabber.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I picked up the taco with the
dabber and dunked that into the Ghost
[SPEAKER_04]: Train haze turps.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was blast off high.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was rocket high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you should have put a little THC in
there somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: My arm hair was wiggling.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, woo!
[SPEAKER_04]: I was making funny faces and funny noises.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was really high for a little while.
[SPEAKER_02]: My first turp dab, my arms and legs went
very pleasantly numb almost immediately.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's something about smoking just
raw turps.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Immediately I was like, damn, this is
medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, it's great recreation,
but for someone somewhere, that's
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to take just the normal shatter
I've got.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got this Durbin poison mob boss
shatter and I just take little chunks of
[SPEAKER_04]: that and dunk that into the OG Kush dabs
and it makes it taste so amazing.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mob boss, that's one I haven't heard of in
a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: When this is gone, I don't know if I'm
going to be able to properly get high
[SPEAKER_04]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I've been smoking this distillate
and these turps so heavily that my
[SPEAKER_04]: tolerance game has upped itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I go smoke with other people,
they're just like, dude, what the fuck is
[SPEAKER_04]: wrong with you?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, don't you want more dabs?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're in the corner in a coma.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, come on, let's party.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more quick question on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think the turps, I mean,
I think I already know the answer to this,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'll just ask, do the turps complete
if you dip it in just like a normal
[SPEAKER_02]: shatter?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do the turps complete something there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or make it more powerful in your opinion?
[SPEAKER_04]: It pushes it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It pushes the high a little bit higher.
[SPEAKER_04]: It certainly pushes the high up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the, my theory, it's probably not
such a theory, but the turpinoids work
[SPEAKER_02]: along with the cannabinoids, just like
the, the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: The turpinoids that we're using guys that
looks just like, it looks like pee.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just little drops of gold in a vial.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got the consistency of like a really
high grade, like a machine oil or
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say really runny olive oil,
a little, little runnier than olive oil
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you just dunk the dab right into it is
what I've been doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been putting a dab on the dabber and
just dunk it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did, I dunked it too hard one time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just dunked it in there and gave it a
little swizzle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when it hit the nail, I heard the,
the turps go like sizzled and I had turp
[SPEAKER_04]: face.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like my mouth just tasted like,
like ghost train haze forever,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it was almost unpleasant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, I OD'd my face on turps,
but then I was rocket high.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it kind of, you can almost wash away
the flavor with, with too much,
[SPEAKER_02]: like it's so overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't even get anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You, you maximum overload your mouth.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, I can't taste anything
cause you just ruined my palette.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like when you eat something too spicy
for the next hour, everything just tastes
[SPEAKER_04]: spicy.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to our friend that sent us an email
about digging holes, the bigger the hole,
[SPEAKER_04]: the bigger the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse recommends about a three by three,
a four by four, about 18 inches deep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fill it with the best soil that you can
afford.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put some amendments in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's give them a list of five good
amendments to throw in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Worm castings, oyster shell, alfalfa,
kelp meal, kelp meal, neem seed meal,
[SPEAKER_04]: neem seed meal and caranja seed meal.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's six.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna throw in crab, crab shell or
oyster or shrimp shell meal in there too.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much set there.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, I hope you wrote that down.
[SPEAKER_04]: If not hit that little 15 second back
button twice and you'll get it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Write it down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put that stuff in that big hole with your
soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe put some perlite in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For, uh, rice holes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, that's soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lava rock, lava rock.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some, some sort of drainage.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to get some oxygen in there,
but you don't want to take up too much
[SPEAKER_04]: root space with a bunch of rock and
perlite.
[SPEAKER_04]: So figure out your mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: Outdoor soil doesn't need to be as airy as
indoor soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially in the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can do yourself a great disservice,
um, by putting too much perlite in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's going to increase the
frequency of having to water.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why you're the outdoor pro and I'm
the indoor guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, big shout out to my friend that sent
me the email.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep the emails coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have any more follow up questions,
let me know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get them on the show for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And mulch that soil up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it mulched.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes a huge, huge difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just at the end of the season,
man, it's totally, totally worth it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have to talk about a bunch
of stuff for outdoor season.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got questions this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our friend, Fred, Fred Garvin,
he keeps the messages coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, listens to the Colorado podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: He listens to both of our shows.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have to do more of the swap
casts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, those are fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll duct tape Adam next time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, shout out to Adam.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up 44.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also love picking on you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, so Fred sent us a message while back.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was making seeded plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had a pollen.
[SPEAKER_04]: He put pollen on female plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those plants have now been pollinated.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're forming seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: He put them outdoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, he had many questions about putting,
putting them outdoors, about acclimating
[SPEAKER_04]: them to the outdoor area and how to get
the timer right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once I messaged Jesse about this,
Jesse had a great idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse said that once you, once those
plants are pollinated, if you go put them
[SPEAKER_04]: outside and the light cycles a little bit
off, they're not going to herm because
[SPEAKER_04]: they're already pollinated.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've pretty much passed their,
I guess if they were humans, now they
[SPEAKER_04]: would be in menopause if they were
females.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now they can't, they're past that
cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a whole sexual reproductive thing
is done.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've already decided they're making
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a manifest destiny to complete.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if a girl's pregnant, you can't
already get her pregnant.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't really like, so that that's
those plants that we told Fred to put
[SPEAKER_04]: outside should be a hundred percent legit.
[SPEAKER_04]: He also mentioned in one of his emails
that his outdoor plants were in full
[SPEAKER_04]: flower, so he's totally going to be okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally fine there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So shout out to Fred for sending me
messages.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you've got at least an I read
genetic sticker or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, send me a message.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, tell me that it's you because I know
that that's not your real name,
[SPEAKER_04]: bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know better than that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Send me an email and we'll get you some
more stickers or something if you want it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We love all of your input.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have to clear that one out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have to edit that throat
clear out.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I got a friend on Facebook that,
uh, her, her or his name, I'm pretty sure
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a her though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, is the last name, the first and last
name is last names of movie stars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I called her out on it one time in
a private message was like, I know your
[SPEAKER_02]: name's fake.
[SPEAKER_02]: How'd you figure that out?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, well, duh.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, so, and so, so, and so,
and so, and so, so, oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're clever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, no, I'm not slipping on your
secret tech.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody is who they say they are on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I use my real name.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't, you gotta, then you think about
what you're posting.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't spend time trolling people.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you got your name and face up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Fred put his plants outdoor,
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not going to hermaphrodite on him.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not believe so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, he's going to have viable seeds if he
waits long enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he was, uh, he actually pulled
some of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, I think he's got some of those
seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of them were white, uh, but plenty
of them were viable in tiger stripes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So good work, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what the cross was?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't, I really don't remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, I read so many emails and read
so many crosses that a lot of that shit,
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a lot of the crosses in the green
and healthy wellness garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember what they are off the top
of my head.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the same way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I learned a few, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: As I go, I'm like, that one's this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember that now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just absorbed those slowly.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's got his plants outdoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got seeds in them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And since then his shit got attacked by
spider mites.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he asked his, I don't have his email
in front of me, but basically he said,
[SPEAKER_04]: none of this plant material is going to be
consumed or smoked by people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Since it's all just seeded, uh,
how nuclear can I go to spray the fuck out
[SPEAKER_04]: of it for these spider mites?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, my opinion would be as nuclear as he
is comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I told him.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly what I told him.
[SPEAKER_04]: I told him, keep in mind his health while
he's applying pesticides and keep in mind
[SPEAKER_04]: the health of the rest of his garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I know he's got other cannabis
plants out there and the insects in that
[SPEAKER_02]: garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: The biodiversity of that area.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be be aware of that bees.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, don't kill the bees.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's super important.
[SPEAKER_04]: If the bees go away, everything goes away.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have food.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we don't have bees.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw my dad's neighbor spraying roundup
in his yard the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went and chased that fucker down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, no, I was like, see those
three white boxes over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And instantly he was like, Oh man,
I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got him set up with some Epsom salt
and vinegar.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go organic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll get rid of almost any insect that
you don't want to round.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Several, several tablespoons of Epsom salt
per gallon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I ask you about how to get rid of
fucking, uh, uh, grasshoppers right now in
[SPEAKER_04]: a ganja garden outdoors?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a very popular question lately.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're super heavy everywhere this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I, my wife, Bernadette, my life,
my beautiful wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, she has a list of pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot require or recall any of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and none of them, um, knowing the way
they work and how grasshoppers work,
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt really were necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't, I didn't feel like you may kill
one or two grasshoppers with it,
[SPEAKER_02]: or you may discourage one or two,
but it's so my big thing, um, mow the
[SPEAKER_02]: weeds around your area.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the biggest ones that take
away their food supply.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, molasses traps, which is, um,
a Mason jar that is a quarter of the way
[SPEAKER_02]: filled with water, a quarter of the way
filled with molasses, buried to the rim,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, around the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's kind of arcade, you know,
really simple here, but yeah, it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: they fall in it and they can't get up.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes total sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, try to attract Blue Jays and Robbins
to your grow area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Robbins, I don't know how to attract
Blue Jays.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know really like peanuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: What else is going to show up if we throw
out peanuts?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, is that going to bring rabbits?
[SPEAKER_02]: I suppose so possibly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my first idea, I told my friend to put
a chicken in his yard to get rid of his
[SPEAKER_04]: grasshoppers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that going to bring me more problems?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, in the beginning stages, chickens love
grasshoppers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also have juvenile marijuana plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you've got a four or five foot tall
bush, uh, the chicken is going to use it
[SPEAKER_02]: as shade and it really isn't going to
notice it too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might pick at the understory a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I might clean it up for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might do some lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey Pedro, it's time to go to work buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chickens don't have to have badges.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got a whole bunch of undocumented chickens
running this fucking conger farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're fucking doing pest management and
lollipopping plants for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're geniuses over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's train some chickens, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, four cocks tree service.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: This got weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, blame it on the Terps hashtag blame it
on the Terps.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's new.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to the Terps.
[SPEAKER_02]: One other comment on, uh, grasshoppers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hippie dibby when it comes to growing
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, as soon as I hear about a grasshopper
problem, I feel like something's out of
[SPEAKER_02]: balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So instead of killing the grasshopper,
you might want to look at the bigger
[SPEAKER_02]: picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's always something's missing
there or if you're doing something wrong
[SPEAKER_02]: or so.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to say that's like 75% of the
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really, I feel like this applies to
smaller grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like those guys out on Salem road where
they've got four acres planted in the
[SPEAKER_02]: ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I mean, that's a completely different
scenario.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to have those issues
regardless.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a lot of damn cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went out and drove and looked at it
today, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called the green mile for a reason.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're doing huge things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone talks shit about Pueblo,
Colorado, but everywhere around us is
[SPEAKER_04]: greenhouses and outdoor grows and just
acres and acres of hemp and acres and
[SPEAKER_04]: acres of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so rad right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drive out there a 50 and 96.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need more places.
[SPEAKER_04]: Huge to more, um, I don't know that
there's a technical term for these
[SPEAKER_04]: restaurants, uh, fast casual, I think more
fast casual restaurants because that's
[SPEAKER_04]: what the grow industry and people like us,
that's what we crave.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't want the Taco bell, the Dr.
Pepper.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hated going here earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: What you got there is that Sonic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's D I don't, I, there's nothing
at Sonic for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, honestly.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing there.
[SPEAKER_04]: McDonald's offers nothing for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many fast food places.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes Jimmy John's if that's even,
you know, in a Qdoba and Chipotle,
[SPEAKER_04]: because you can get a veggie burrito
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty much the options.
[SPEAKER_04]: The beans at both those places tastes
like, hell.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you just got to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: See even the vegetarians, well,
of course, vegetarians know what's up with
[SPEAKER_02]: a good batch of beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made a Facebook post the other day
about, sorry, that microphone stands a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit funny, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, about if you know the smell of good or
if you can tell good beans based on smell
[SPEAKER_02]: alone, you might be from Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They got to have that rich earthy smell to
them and not too salty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we need more like a, like a Panera and
like, I don't know, just more of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Style.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't even have a Qdoba here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little deli's and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: A witch witch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tokyo Joe's.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can go for that kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, which is stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All kinds of free advertising for a bunch
of shitty restaurants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to, uh, uh, tomato Joe's,
uh, in Pueblo on, I think that's main
[SPEAKER_02]: street.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I eat there?
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like a place I could eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, they do have a veggie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, sandwich for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's just a, uh, your mic is totally
good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting away from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just going to rock star.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that how you do it on the Colorado
podcast?
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have stance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize for the thing going limp on
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got a couple of veggie sandwiches.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a little mom and pop hole in the
wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's right by the library.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go eat there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's put this train wreck back on a,
on a, on some rails here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about cannabis growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not the Colorado podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did not bring 44 sandwiches.
[SPEAKER_04]: We couldn't bring 44.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's not allowed to go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the exclusion zone.
[SPEAKER_04]: When, when is that done?
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_04]: Poor dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: We missed you bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't wait till you come out and play
again.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Jesse wanted to talk about something
that I find to be really important that
[SPEAKER_04]: people don't realize.
[SPEAKER_04]: People want to jump into the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: People move from all over the country to
Colorado, to Washington, to California,
[SPEAKER_04]: to Oregon, to Michigan, to all these
places that where cannabis growing is
[SPEAKER_04]: legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they show up here and they have either
grown in their basement and in a legal
[SPEAKER_04]: state for a couple of years and had two or
three lights, or they set up a small grow
[SPEAKER_04]: here in their garage or their basement and
they run four or six lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they think I'm going to open a
big ass grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they're either going to do it
legally or illegally.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to get permits or not,
or maybe they're just going to do this in
[SPEAKER_04]: an illegal place.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been growing in their basement for
a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're out there in the sticks in
Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you're like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to buy that old meat plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to hang us up a hundred blocks
and maybe they do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: So the mistake that a lot of these people
fuck up is they don't realize that going
[SPEAKER_04]: from the basement to a large grow
facility, it's not just taking this much
[SPEAKER_04]: air conditioning and multiplying at times.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, more or many lights you're going
to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't work that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: You run into a whole new shit stew of
problems when you start going to big scale
[SPEAKER_04]: growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: The humidity is ridiculously hard to
control in a large room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Retardedly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ridiculously.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can, you can say that word.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It bugs me a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone's evolving.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, it is a, it's hard as shit to
remove a lot of humidity in a very large
[SPEAKER_04]: room.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also hard to regulate the temperature
and the airflow and the CO2.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a lot of tricks to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the biggest mistake you see people
make when they go from, when a dude goes
[SPEAKER_04]: and just builds his first big,
when new people get their OPC license and
[SPEAKER_04]: they can build a grow, where do they fuck
up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Always air conditioning, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And humidity never even gets considered
because they think this is the desert.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it is the desert, but they think
it's not going to be an issue because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: so dry here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a bunch of BS.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to go pumping water into
those plants every single day and they
[SPEAKER_04]: transpire and there are thousand watt
lights, a bunch of them right above those
[SPEAKER_04]: plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the water wants to come out and go up
toward those lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it hangs out up by the ceiling
and then it falls back down and then it
[SPEAKER_04]: hangs out and it gets between two leaves
and it festers for a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you know what it does?
[SPEAKER_04]: It turns into fucking powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the spores are there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just starts flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just waiting for you to give it the
prime tradition.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That whole grow room is the perfect
condition for bugs and fucking funguses
[SPEAKER_04]: and problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the air conditioning and the humidity
are always definitely the first thing that
[SPEAKER_04]: I think of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big grow room.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a living organism that is full of
lots of other smaller living organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was explaining it to a buddy this way
earlier today and it itself has special
[SPEAKER_02]: care that needs done to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just the plants inside of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got 85 lights in the flower room at
Green and Healthy and we run 50 tons.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a 30 in the middle and two 10s
on the opposite sides.
[SPEAKER_04]: 50 tons of air conditioning to cool that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got three air, see that's smart,
three air conditioners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If one goes down.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got two backups that can kind of,
if the 30 goes down, it gets warm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet it does.
[SPEAKER_04]: But luckily we're running Gavitas with the
Gavita master controller.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you tell it that if it gets above 86 in
here, I want you to dim the lights until
[SPEAKER_04]: it gets back down to 77 and then you can
go back up if you need to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That Gavita master controller is awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to run two of them because we have
so many lights, but I mean, they're so
[SPEAKER_04]: easy to program that it doesn't even
matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are 50 lights each, aren't they?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they only do 40.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to do 50 because we're on 85
lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, the Nanos do 199 each.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, but see what sucks about that is
you still might have to buy multiple units
[SPEAKER_02]: if they're in different rooms because you
can't break them into zones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Luckily our room is one 85 light,
big giant open room with like six rows of
[SPEAKER_04]: madness in it right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to my friends at Veg Bloom.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you are growing on a small scale,
a medium scale, or a large scale,
[SPEAKER_04]: and you want nutrients to push your garden
and you want to see what you can really
[SPEAKER_04]: do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking Veg Bloom is something I would
recommend.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's affordable.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easy to use.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so far I'm six, no, I'm seven weeks
in, and this is the best grow I've done at
[SPEAKER_04]: the Green and Healthy Wellness Garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a run right next to it that
was not Veg Bloom.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've already, I've already passed the
size of those buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're being harvested at week nine and
these other buds are at week seven and
[SPEAKER_04]: they're already bigger than the week nine
buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I support Veg Bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to do three of light this
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's the only place you could go
from your last performance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Last time we crushed it, we did pretty
damn well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to the boys at Green and Healthy
Wellness and the whole Terp jungle for
[SPEAKER_04]: helping me out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even shout out to the new guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So not enough air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then nobody considers getting rid of
the humidity.
[SPEAKER_04]: There needs to be an exit for all of the
moisture that comes into the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: You might be filling the room with CO2.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: But where is all of that old stagnant air
going that's in there?
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to get rid of that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to be in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you walk into the grow room and it
feels funky to you, it feels funky to the
[SPEAKER_04]: plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should be able to close your eyes and
breathe and not notice that you've walked
[SPEAKER_04]: into a grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: It should just feel like normal,
like this living room right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Swamp cooler going.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little funky in there, but it got a
little dampness in the shower from the
[SPEAKER_04]: swamp cooler.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was like 90 something degrees
today, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things I've noticed, humid, like we were
talking earlier, foliar spraying,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, how even just watering,
brewing a damn tea, you know, brewing 200
[SPEAKER_02]: gallons of tea can spike the humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get that 200 gallons of tea too close
to the whites and it just starts
[SPEAKER_04]: evaporating.
[SPEAKER_04]: It heats up the tea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then all that moisture in the room carries
heat and heats up the room as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go through the hot and cold cycles
naturally through the day, the building
[SPEAKER_02]: getting heated up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, most of these grows are in fairly
thin-shelled commercial warehouses that
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't insulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're insulated as well as they could
be.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get the heating and cooling effect
from just the natural outside temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had to build a concrete wall on the
outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had to fur it, is I think the
construction term.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had to fur a wall out six inches with
concrete to kind of insulate ourselves a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm glad to hear that you're not the
only, I'm not the only person that might
[SPEAKER_02]: have to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The east wall of our facility right about
or no, the west wall, the west wall of the
[SPEAKER_02]: facility, the way it all sits as the sun
starts going down, it just bakes it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the wall goes, you know, from being in
the seventies all the way up into it's
[SPEAKER_02]: radiating heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can feel it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see those waves coming off when
you go outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ours was the exact opposite.
[SPEAKER_04]: When the winter came, it got so cold on
that wall that we could see moisture on
[SPEAKER_04]: the inside of the wall.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: That wall is going to do that too if we
don't fix it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your wall is going to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you'll get a PM issue because
you're introducing moisture right there
[SPEAKER_04]: and that temperature fluctuation near that
wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Learn everything the damn hard way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, no, I wouldn't have it any other
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should have seen the guys that did the
concrete over the front of the building.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were three dudes that didn't speak
much English.
[SPEAKER_04]: They showed up in a truck with a truck,
a wheelbarrow, a whole bunch of cement and
[SPEAKER_04]: some jank key scaffolding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two dudes carry the scaffolding to where
they needed to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they just pointed and grunted a couple
of times right here, right here,
[SPEAKER_04]: right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: They set up the first level and then one
dude climbed that and they threw parts to
[SPEAKER_04]: him while he was standing on the
scaffolding and he stuck them in place and
[SPEAKER_04]: then climbed up that and hung and grabbed
other shit and built like a four story
[SPEAKER_04]: scaffold by himself, climbed up and down
it like a spider monkey scared the shit
[SPEAKER_03]: out of me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they start the cement from the top and
let it run down kinda and he's up on the
[SPEAKER_04]: top of the scaffolding and he yells uno
and the guy on the bottom is mixing cement
[SPEAKER_04]: in a wheelbarrow with those little trowel
things in his hand and he puts a pile on
[SPEAKER_04]: the thing and he doesn't throw the tool,
but he throws the concrete, just chucks it
[SPEAKER_04]: up into the air between the scaffolding
and the dude up top puts his trowel down,
[SPEAKER_04]: doesn't even look, catches that fucking
cement on it and smears it on the wall
[SPEAKER_04]: like Daniel's son.
[SPEAKER_04]: Left, right, left, right, left,
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he yells dos and the guy throws
two of them up and he puts both of his
[SPEAKER_04]: little tools down and catches both of them
and smears it on the wall and he's running
[SPEAKER_04]: left and right and he's yelling uno,
dos as he gets to the middle and the guy
[SPEAKER_04]: throws how many he needs and he just keeps
fucking smearing it and as it's coming
[SPEAKER_04]: down he goes to the top and pushes it down
and then jumps to the next level and
[SPEAKER_04]: repeats.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they got it all done and went
back and smoothed it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It took these three dudes, seriously two
hours to do the entire front of this
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking building, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I would hire those guys for fucking
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So fuck you, Trump.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hard working motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know my background,
I worked in the construction industry for
[SPEAKER_02]: over a decade and there's a reason why
there's not that many white guys employed
[SPEAKER_02]: in the construction industry anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, take that Trump.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, fuck you, Trump.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no problem with hiring some
illegals to come do some construction
[SPEAKER_04]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do the shit that white people think
they're too good to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck yeah, you couldn't pay me enough to
do some of the shit that some of those
[SPEAKER_04]: guys would do just to make enough money to
send home to their family and I have no
[SPEAKER_04]: problem with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do your thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Asphalt and black tar roofing,
I do draw the line there without a doubt.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm fucking white as this paper.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want me on a roof.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, any kind of roofing I draw the
line at, to be honest, it's horrible.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so you got to get air
conditioning and humidity.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to have an exit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to have a vent drawing stale air
out of the building and getting it out of
[SPEAKER_04]: the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something super important when
you're going from a basement grow to a
[SPEAKER_04]: larger commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys have to run?
[SPEAKER_04]: We should be, but we're allowed one more
complaint before we get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's economics.
[SPEAKER_04]: The fine is cheaper than the filters that
we need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here in Pueblo, one of their big concerns
was carbon filters and we've got six of
[SPEAKER_02]: those big fuckers all over ours.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've even got the inline ones on our air
cool plates.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're disgustingly lucky because across
the street from us is homeward bound dog
[SPEAKER_04]: crematorium.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so every day around noon you smell
garlic bread and then you realize fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: cooking animals across the street.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a dead animal being cremated.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I told the new guy, we got a new guy
and I smelled it the other day and I was
[SPEAKER_04]: like, Oh, I can't even let him do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I walked into the other room where he was
ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey bro, you smell that garlic bread and
he goes, yeah, who's cooking?
[SPEAKER_04]: I go, that's the dog crematorium next
door.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't enjoy it too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Rover.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he just looked at me like,
that's, he said, that's fluffy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, yeah, they're just
roasting that motherfucker, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's funny cause the first few days I
worked there, I smelled something and
[SPEAKER_04]: there were two girls that used to work
there that are no longer affiliated with
[SPEAKER_04]: us, but they used to work there and they'd
be like every day at like noon or two o
[SPEAKER_04]: 'clock, I smelled garlic bread and they
were standing in the grill room,
[SPEAKER_04]: just sucking it in one day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, where is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: It smells so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once I realized what it was a few days
later, I was like, those girls were loving
[SPEAKER_04]: the smell of burnt puppies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fried kittens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: This podcast just got really morbid.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awkward.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason I brought it up is just carbon
filter systems in a home grow versus a
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drastically different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hugely different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I said what we need is way
expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need like HIPAA filter grade shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: UV lighting possibly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a small UV light that I use on
small plantlings.
[SPEAKER_04]: I run it over I just walk through the grow
room and just hover that light about four
[SPEAKER_04]: to six inches over every little plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it keeps them nice and bug free.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause the bugs want nothing to do with
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the PM, there is not any.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that thing is helpful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was using that on another guy's garden
that had bad PM.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it took eight days to just
deteriorate all the PM.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know an old guy that has not enough
fucking filtration or refuses to blow the
[SPEAKER_04]: air out of his house cause he's afraid and
he keeps getting PM.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they keep learning new tricks on how to
get rid of it for him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keeps us on our toes.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So filtration is something that you super
definitely need.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get that stale funky air out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to need UV lighting.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to need HIPAA filtration.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your air conditioners have exchanges and
they're going to pull the air from the
[SPEAKER_04]: grow room and that's going to blow back
into your grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also a large portion of that is going
to escape into the outside atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're going to be stinking it up that
way also.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you need carbon scrubbers inside the
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty fucking hard to keep the
smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we didn't have a, and they came to us
and they're like, Hey, we can smell
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're like, yeah, we would try to keep
the smell down.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you know it's us?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they said, well, we've been to all the
other grows and you guys seem to know more
[SPEAKER_04]: what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They gave us a compliment.
[SPEAKER_04]: The MED and the city loves us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause we're friends with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we don't hide from them.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some dispensary owners that
don't get along with those people cause
[SPEAKER_04]: they're shifty dicks and they're just
keeping it real.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're keeping it real and we're trying
to be on the legit side.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're cool when they come over and say,
Hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually, I'm looking forward to our
first visit because the place I work at
[SPEAKER_02]: now is completely different than some of
the other places I've worked at.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice when you can look forward to MED
visits.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know they'll have some issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they will.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're always going to, that's their job.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not scared of anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything that we have messed up on it's
either cause we didn't understand it
[SPEAKER_04]: properly or invite the department of
agriculture in for a walkthrough,
[SPEAKER_04]: like invite them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if you invite them, they won't
give you any violations for whatever they
[SPEAKER_04]: find.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll tell you to correct it since you
invited them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'll be like, you've got 90 days to
get it corrected.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we come back, that's when we'll
actually be able to put you on like a
[SPEAKER_04]: warning notice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you invite them, they show up and
they're like, Oh, good job.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you can be like, I need help.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come show me what to correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of the way to do with the
department of ag and the guy that's been
[SPEAKER_04]: going around is fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't think of his name right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I can almost remember his name in my
head, but he's a cool little dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's an older dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's kind of a short guy, but he's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's fun to hang out with.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's very informative, very educational.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he'll talk to you like you're a human.
[SPEAKER_04]: He won't treat you like a stupid grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like some of the industry people do like
electricians and HVAC guys trying to talk
[SPEAKER_04]: to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we're fucking retarded HVAC guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was dealing with one yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was about ready to strangle the guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had to walk out of the office.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, yeah, you're fucking idiot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes, sometimes some contractors are
a pain in the ass to deal with.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's something to look forward to.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're building your big grow,
find some contractors that you can trust.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Pueblo, good fucking luck.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're in Pueblo, Colorado,
you'd be better off paying crews from
[SPEAKER_04]: Denver to come down and build your grow,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a good builder?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's decent and he's very connected in the
city.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knows he's on first name basis with
everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shit goes pretty smoothly.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So check this out.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're trying to get a grow bill in
Colorado, in the Pueblo, Colorado region,
[SPEAKER_04]: find a guy who does construction by the
name of Gagliano.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gagliano's construction in Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you contact them, be like,
Hey, I was listening to a podcast and this
[SPEAKER_04]: guy named Rasta Jeff told me about you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anything that we do business with,
you owe him 2% commission and just make
[SPEAKER_04]: sure that he sends me 2%.
[SPEAKER_04]: 2% is not a lot to ask for.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, it's very small.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 2%.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you got a dollar, you'd give me,
if you had a dollar in change,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's why I'm headed with this.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it was in coins on the floor,
you wouldn't care if I picked up two
[SPEAKER_04]: pennies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope, not a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two pennies, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you got to break a buck, I get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's breaking the big one.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you got the soft 100 pennies,
I could take two of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Find yourself a good contractor is the
point of all this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause contractors can fuck up your whole
day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I worked in another facility that the
blueprint was drawn by one guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: The HVAC system was designed by another in
the electrical, which we're going to talk
[SPEAKER_04]: about in a minute, was designed by another
guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were all, it was like we took a
Ferrari engine, maybe a Porsche,
[SPEAKER_04]: a turbo, kit, and then maybe like a
Lamborghini body, and then the suspension
[SPEAKER_04]: system for a Corvette.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, you got all these dope
ass parts, make it go fast, Ricky Bobby.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like fucking, we're like, yeah,
but the air conditioning doesn't work when
[SPEAKER_04]: you turn on all the lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there's not enough power to do all of
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so like, yeah, you need good
contractors, good engineers, a fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: engineer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very key is an engineer that
understands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you're not always going to find a
contractor that understands indoor
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't understand how much humidity is
coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rarely will find a contractor that
understands it, but you can find engineers
[SPEAKER_02]: that know what they're doing and engineers
are smart people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can explain shit to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that's, that was real key in the
uncle bud company development.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a really good engineer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I'll let you give them a nice plug.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to write it down so that I
remember I was able to relay concerns I
[SPEAKER_02]: had to, to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, you know, we got to make
sure this doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like electricity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, we, we just have to have
plenty of electricity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Three phase power all day long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not quite, but we got two meters.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many amps are you allowed to pull?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're 400 on both on each box.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get 800 total amps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nowhere near drawing full capacity.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lot of amperage.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you get to flip the fucking on switch?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got two inside.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever done it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it feel ridiculous?
[SPEAKER_04]: When it content, when the contacts touch
all that power, it's not something you
[SPEAKER_02]: could do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you, if you're not strong enough
to push it all the way through,
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't want to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, cause that's a lot of power.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot of freaking short and
something there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just gotta go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just push it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some smaller folks might not be able
to push that thing all the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a little wiry dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: See Adam up there trying to push it like
Mickey mouse all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam and 44.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam and D both D on top trying to deal
with his broken hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's stop there.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not the, uh, the Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't get any love.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are we talking about?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So another thing we kind of touched on
this one, get a fucking certified,
[SPEAKER_04]: qualified, reliable professional
electrician.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if your contractors do fuck up,
you can fire them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't just be like, you know, I hired this
guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to stick with him.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you fucking don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not dating and you can call them on
it and you can make them come back and fix
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or take away their junk and you're not
going to pay for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's take away their junk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every contractor has got a pile of his
shit in your facility while he's working
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll hold it hostage until you get what
the fuck you do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of a fucked up way to go about
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you just lock the doors and you're
like, bro, you done fucked up.
[SPEAKER_04]: My walls are all crooked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make my wall straight and then I'll pay
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you got to do shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: The flooring flooring has always been a
bitch in every facility I've been to.
[SPEAKER_04]: The flooring has been an issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just hard to get floors right in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a brand name of specific paint
for you, but I don't know it off the top
[SPEAKER_02]: of my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got one little flake out of 2000
square feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's had almost three months of work on
top of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I bet you dropped something heavy to
get that one chip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The grit on your face.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a stainless steel table.
[SPEAKER_04]: They knew it was a table.
[SPEAKER_04]: I fucking knew it was a long ass hydro
table.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like tables.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put your plants on tables.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, raise them up off the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get them up where you can work on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got ours on the floor right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something, uh, cleaning,
uh, mopping up after six plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: 12 plants is one thing mopping up after
176 plants is a completely different
[SPEAKER_02]: story.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got an assistant grower now and every
like few days he's like, what do you want
[SPEAKER_04]: me to do, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, just clean up.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, seriously?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, yeah, just go fucking every
little random thing that's fallen out of a
[SPEAKER_04]: plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the perlite that's on a table.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or any whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's a pair of scissors laying
around, go clean all that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Measuring jars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Start from the top in the flower room,
go all the way down.
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's old trellis or old pots in
there from something that's been
[SPEAKER_04]: harvested, that's gotta go sweep every
goddamn corner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get out the shop vac, suck up underneath
all the weird random little nooks and
[SPEAKER_04]: crannies that we got in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything that's not going to be used
doesn't need to be in the flower room.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think like scissors and boxes of
material that shit should go in the
[SPEAKER_04]: storage room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Store that or put it right outside the
flower room.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're fortunate enough to have a storage
room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put the broom and dust pan and trash can
outside the flower room.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys put that shit outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just don't have that in the flowering room
or the bedroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Simple little tasks that you don't even
think about doing in a small group can
[SPEAKER_02]: literally take days in a big group.
[SPEAKER_02]: Defoliating?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shaving legs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shaving legs and defoliating.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you guys are all netting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm doing a big seed run, so that
wasn't really an option.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like double and triple layer trellising.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get crazy on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bend them down.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a guy, a former employee that
would defoliate the entire room for an
[SPEAKER_04]: entire shift.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he would do 10 five gallon buckets
full of leaves and he would push them
[SPEAKER_04]: down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like he would just chop leaves all day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then go back and scoop up the leaves
out of the trays into five gallon buckets.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he'd probably fill 10 five gallon
buckets.
[SPEAKER_04]: He'd fill one of those big like 30 gallon
trash cans halfway full with just leaves
[SPEAKER_04]: just from the first run of defoliating.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing is you don't have to do in the
basement.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to weigh all that and we have to
track it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate that part of it so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Document what all that shit weighed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Manicured weight.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even manicure it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just pulled the damn leaf off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got a, you know how you're
supposed to like mix it with soil or
[SPEAKER_02]: vinegar, oil or something like that before
you can throw it away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's catch the listeners up though.
[SPEAKER_04]: In a commercial grow, if you have,
see maybe a bud isn't desirable or the
[SPEAKER_04]: bottom part of the plant, I throw that
shit away.
[SPEAKER_04]: When that's in the trash can, you have to
cut it up into little tiny pieces and then
[SPEAKER_04]: you have to mix it, like Jesse said,
with soil or kitty litter is what they
[SPEAKER_04]: recommended.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or gravel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or vinegar or something else that you can
put in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cooking oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything to make it unusable and
unrecognizable.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it sounds like you got a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got three worm farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Feed it to the worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're loving it too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sure they love their can of meal.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use a shit ton of worm castings too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it helps cut down costs there.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pre-cycling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when we get our greenhouse built.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a whole wall in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be a shelf system full of
worm bins and everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Worm shitting into a funnel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a warm shit funnel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just tunnel it down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn, that's pretty red.
[SPEAKER_04]: We grind it up pretty small.
[SPEAKER_04]: We chop it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I chop it up with the shears.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just go ham on it with the shears.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we make lasagna.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically we take the old pot that the
plant's been harvested from and shake that
[SPEAKER_04]: soil into the trash can.
[SPEAKER_04]: We let them dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've all sat around and dried for a
couple of days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dump all that soil into the trash can.
[SPEAKER_04]: Throw a bunch of the waste into there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dump a couple more pots, more soil,
a couple more pot or more waste.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just keep it like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a way to get rid of all of our
old soil at the same time and kind of have
[SPEAKER_04]: a use for it instead of just wasting all
that good dirt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I know it's recyclable.
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally know I can use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we use so much cocoa.
[SPEAKER_04]: We buy 14 big bags of cocoa at a time when
we go because that's what fits in Hunt's
[SPEAKER_04]: car.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you're talking like the big tall bags.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those bags that are right there,
the 1.75 cubic feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are bigger than your average bag.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I use at the house now too,
is cocoa.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm upgraded.
[SPEAKER_04]: And shout out to Way to Grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope nobody just heard me burp into that
microphone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Way to Grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was buying cocoa grow the other day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really liked the botanic hair cocoa
grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't prefer the aeration bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just get the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't need that aeration in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Way to Grow was nice enough to throw
in a bunch of bags of Fox Farms Ocean
[SPEAKER_04]: Forest soil for free.
[SPEAKER_04]: They carried that shit to my car and
they're like, you buy a lot of shit here,
[SPEAKER_04]: bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are from you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, fuck yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know exactly where that soil was going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to my friends at Way to Grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: They know who they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if they listen to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you do listen to the podcast,
contact me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I'd love to have you as a sponsor on
the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be rad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rusted Jeff account.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they know my account name and they
laugh every time they hear it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They laugh every time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause we've got the commercial account and
the name of the account is really funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: They know the name now.
[SPEAKER_04]: They already know what to type in when I
walk up to the register.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you told me one time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you need a good fucking electrician.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need a way to get rid of humidity.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need a way to get rid of heat.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need plenty of air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to seal up all the cracks,
all the nooks and crannies.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to be able to clean the fuck out
of this place.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got to be a semi-clean facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want some old car garage where
the floor is all greasy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need a floor drain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Floor drains are crucial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And water.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need access to water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of warehouses out in Pueblo by the
airport, they don't have water ran to them
[SPEAKER_04]: because they didn't need water for
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's, if you get one of those
warehouses out there, sorry, just had to
[SPEAKER_04]: make sure it was on track here.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you get one of those warehouses out
there, you might not have water.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to be getting trucks
of water.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to pay to get water
out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something people aren't aware of.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you get a large grow on private land
out, say in Pueblo County somewhere,
[SPEAKER_04]: you have to get water rights.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because you have land doesn't mean
you're granted water rights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if there's a well there, you have to
purchase water to offset what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: taking out of the aquifer.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if there are enough grows around that
area that that jurisdiction deems the
[SPEAKER_04]: water is compromised by you coming,
they can decline your water rights.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't have any water.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this, I mean, even to the point that
they don't care that you're going to town
[SPEAKER_02]: to buy it and that you have a big truck.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you can't prove that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a inside track with the
department of natural resources now.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anyone has any questions or anything,
you can hit me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Message our friend, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of the great people that we meet.
[SPEAKER_04]: These people would never take you and I
seriously.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse's got a semi ponytail, a beard
fucking tattooed up.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got, is that a trout on your arm?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got two.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew it was a trout.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so rad.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a trout on his arm.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a Colorado flag.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a chili.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, that's just one arm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, he's got a Monarch butterfly and a
snowboard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's his one arm.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's tatted up and I bet a lot of the,
and I've, I'm six five with dreadlocks and
[SPEAKER_04]: red eyes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's pretty much a good disc and a
crooked hat.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just wear Dickies every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I destroy clothes and it's easier
just to wear Dickies that are
[SPEAKER_04]: indestructible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these contractors and business folks
would never have taken us seriously before
[SPEAKER_04]: the scandalous industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I find it so funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've noticed when I go to restaurants in
Denver and I'm wearing like a,
[SPEAKER_04]: just a dad kid shirt, basically my iry
shirt and my hat crooked and a pendee and
[SPEAKER_04]: skate shoes and my Dickies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I walk in red eyed before restaurants
would kind of be a dick to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'd kind of be like, Oh, this guy's
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like he's fucking up our vibe.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now there's always some young hip
waitress.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, what's up guys at work in the
weed industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to tip the fuck out of me.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want some great service, honey?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're work rich.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, completely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want, I don't want fancy things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a nice, uh, some good hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: And live comfortably.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go to a lot of good shows.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go see the dead.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whenever they come around, I'm going to go
see fish.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time they're around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you check out the dead company?
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw the dead and co.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was fucking rad.
[SPEAKER_02]: This most recent one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just this recent one when they're in
Boulder at Folsom field.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to see one of these shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you have to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come with me one time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll have a good time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to, I used to eat a bunch of
psychedelic drugs when I used to go to
[SPEAKER_04]: those shows and I've quit doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a head injury.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody that listens to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard about the head injury.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a year and a half and I still
have effects from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I hate to admit it and talk about it,
but I still have like TBI.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got post-concussion syndrome and I've
got a traumatic brain injury still.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had, I played high school football very
competitively.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had major concussions in high school and
I know I didn't let them heal up
[SPEAKER_02]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wonder sometimes how that affects
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: You ever, you ever doing shit and you go,
Oh, that's from that time I hit my head.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you ever have those moments?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have those moments where I wonder if
that's, you know, I just blame it on that
[SPEAKER_04]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, yep, that's, that's from the
time I smacked myself right now when I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: reaching to the left for no reason and my
jacket's to the right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is why that's from the time I smacked
my fucking head.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's try to get back on track.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know where the fuck we were
talking about concussions and building
[SPEAKER_02]: grows large facilities.
[SPEAKER_04]: Large facilities.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a first aid kit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk about needing one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water tanks, water filtration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, your average on the shelf gross store
water filter can't handle the amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: water that.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you need a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_04]: I use a thousand gallons of water every 48
hours to grow and that's 105 lights total.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing a hundred and 55 to 165 right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seaburst still not even at full capacity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in full flower and I've got plants
that are five feet tall with big fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: donkey dick buds on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And either way, that's still a lot more
than your basement grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so much more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're using, I figure you use about
indoors, you probably use five gallons of
[SPEAKER_04]: water per light every 48 to 72 hours ish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the most part.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the way I used to.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you guys are trying to figure out
how much water you should be using in your
[SPEAKER_04]: indoor, every 1000 watt or 600 watt light,
600, 1000 watt light.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should be running about five gallons
every 24 to 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: If your temperatures and your humidity and
everything are dialed in and your plants
[SPEAKER_04]: are at their optimum growth, your plants
are growing a little slow.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're probably overwatering them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's usually the first sign of
overwatering some plants outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be average.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say five gallons of plant per plant
per day, per day super hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it okay to just turn on the hose and
just let the hose just fucking flood those
[SPEAKER_04]: outdoor plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, for the most part.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to concentrate it more just around
the plant because I feel like it's
[SPEAKER_02]: wasting, you know, just to conserve it
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, no, you could totally do like a
field flood irrigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually know of a wholesale place here
in Pueblo County that floods are filled
[SPEAKER_02]: just like they do with cantaloupe or
watermelon or anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just flood the whole field out,
let it soak and then let it dry and
[SPEAKER_04]: reflood it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just doing a flood and drain
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they do it like two or three times
a season.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to go explore and visit more of
these outdoor cannabis and hemp grows.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see how you guys are doing a lot
of this shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to learn from your tech.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see what I can implement into my
indoor tech.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can show you a couple of cool ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to see a bunch of big stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something I think is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: The overwhelming majority of these places
are no till raised bed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, neat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So no till you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: They, uh, they make an amended soil with a
lot of special amendments and then very
[SPEAKER_04]: specific amendments that I'm ignorant to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, I don't know what goes into
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of, um, life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, uh, worm castings, live worms,
live worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, it's living soil, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the plants are harvested and do you
pull out the big root ball or you just
[SPEAKER_04]: leave that in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: You pull out the stem around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You actually want to leave as much of the
root ball in there as you can cause the
[SPEAKER_02]: worms are going to eat it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Turn it back into nutrients for the plant
again, life, life going in circles.
[SPEAKER_02]: You pull the plan out and you put a new
one in and you send her off again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they use a lot of cover crops and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're stacking stuff into the pot and
then the worms will eat all of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mostly that stuff will decompose and
become plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, so you're going to start losing
a little bit of depth every time,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the depth of the, of the soil is
going to move down and then you can just
[SPEAKER_04]: refill it with your fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how you recharge no tills.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go back in top dress in all your
recharged amendments.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never thought of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, uh, it's extremely economical.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why most of these places are
running it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's such a large scale that it's just,
did the plants taste good?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I think being an indoor grower who
uses mainly bottled nutrients for most of
[SPEAKER_04]: my grow career, I've always been taught to
flush my plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they always, are they those guys that
say I don't need to flush?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I've been flushing the whole time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And is that those guys?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's, since they're not feeding a
whole bunch of bottled nutrients,
[SPEAKER_04]: a bunch of chelated salts, their plants
aren't backed up with stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Their plants are probably more able to,
uh, I don't, I can't even remember the
[SPEAKER_04]: word right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of the nutrients that are going
through, they can use it a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: better.
[SPEAKER_04]: It comes up and goes down.
[SPEAKER_04]: They get rid of it a little more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get to pick and choose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of being force fed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants actually finish themselves off.
[SPEAKER_02]: They start fading.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like you, they would if they're
flooded, I mean flushed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they know.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just like, Hey, my season's done.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's neat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you see a difference in specific
strains?
[SPEAKER_04]: Does strain A versus strain B,
do they finish differently in the no-till
[SPEAKER_04]: outdoor?
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't done enough of it to say that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just curious if that was nutrients
running out or if that was actually the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant realizing, Hey, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm flushing myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know in my experience, um, the way I
grow my plants, grow in the grounds kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of no-till pretty much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Girl Scout cookies and flow will
finish themselves off without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: The form cut Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Flow will finish herself off.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been going for about an hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's, uh, let's start wrapping it up
because I am actually expecting dinner to
[SPEAKER_04]: show up in the next 20 or 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just started thinking about that about
15 minutes ago too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw you messing with your phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, he's dealing with his dinner.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly what that was.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, Hey, I'll be there in 15.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, give us 30.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually got to go foliar spray some
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you going to spray?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, essential oils.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So pesticide pest management integrated
pest management with essential oils.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are to, um, 13 days into flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, just about the end of that spray
period right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the lights just shut off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to go hit them with it a few
more times and get in there with that
[SPEAKER_04]: green light.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you wear the forehead green light or do
you have a room light?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I got the forehead one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like the full room ones.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So inevitably that light switch always
gets left on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and, and you don't notice it when all
the other lights are on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's just running that green light for
nothing all day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a little CFL, I like the green light on
my head because then it's looking where
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually focused where I am instead
of just, then you don't get shadows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, good point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I shadow myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_04]: If the lights from behind, I don't see
shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've talked a lot about building,
getting your large commercial grow going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any things that you want to
add before we start wrapping this up so
[SPEAKER_04]: that I don't cut off any of your useful
data for our listeners?
[SPEAKER_02]: Find a person that can be vouched for by
many people throughout the community to
[SPEAKER_02]: work with your engineer, to help design
your building and pay him what he is
[SPEAKER_02]: worth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, if it'll be a guy like me
or Jeff, and even if he's not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow for you, pay him what it's worth and
your end product will drastically improve
[SPEAKER_02]: and work better by doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: In my first week in green and healthy
wellness, I made minor improvements that
[SPEAKER_04]: improved the, uh, financial, uh,
it just made sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: I fixed their books a little bit just by
fucking doing a couple of adjustments,
[SPEAKER_04]: like making the garden more, more
profitable just by eliminating this and
[SPEAKER_04]: adding this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just took me a week to make a whole
bunch of small improvements, just because
[SPEAKER_04]: the person who set it up and was running
it was not an experienced grower,
[SPEAKER_04]: was not, I don't want to, I don't want to
bash this person, but they weren't a
[SPEAKER_04]: forward thinker.
[SPEAKER_04]: They weren't, they didn't, they didn't
look far enough into the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't have foresight to realize that
if I don't put glue here, the shit's going
[SPEAKER_04]: to come apart eventually.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I fixed a lot of just small details.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't have any heaters in the,
so it was winter when I started,
[SPEAKER_04]: there were no heaters in the reservoirs
and they're feeding the plants 54 degree
[SPEAKER_04]: water and they couldn't get the pH of the
fucking water to come up.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just pouring in pH.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, they couldn't get it to go down.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just pouring in like a half a
gallon of pH down and like, it won't move.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I stuck my hand in there and I was
like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: I go, where does the water come from?
[SPEAKER_04]: He goes to the hose.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, Oh, so municipal water.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming from the fucking line.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's underground and it's 30 degrees
outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I stuck a thermometer in there and that
water was 54 degrees.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, well, that's why the pH won't
move.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why the plants have the claw.
[SPEAKER_04]: They all had the fucking downward claw,
but the plants were purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like everything was purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were happy about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, so I put aquarium heaters in
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, let's go to the fish store and
get the biggest aquarium heaters.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have put two in each one,
set them at 74 degrees and let them run.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you get the glass ones or the stainless
stills?
[SPEAKER_04]: The glass ones, they work beautifully.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I learned that they sell,
um, big R cells, uh, they're for heating
[SPEAKER_04]: animal like horse troughs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's stock tank heaters.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, those would have been more economical,
but I didn't think of that because I'm not
[SPEAKER_04]: a farm boy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just never thought of that for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ordered in a couple at the store last
night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been selling the glass ones and I
found the stainless steel ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and they sold them up very quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm afraid that glass one's going to break
and they're on accident.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in a thousand gallons.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in 250 gallons of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, someday it will, but yeah,
that's, they fell safe though.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not going to get shocked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not in there right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's summertime.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I took those motherfuckers out,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you guys, a lot of the shit you're
going to go spend money on at the hydro
[SPEAKER_04]: store.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go check out the aquarium store before you
do that because, uh, it's cheaper or even
[SPEAKER_02]: Granger to be totally honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't always have to buy all your
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big R has a lot of very useful shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: The normal grow store, not the hydroponic
store, but like the local garden supply
[SPEAKER_04]: center has a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Home Depot and Lowe's and Target have a
lot of good shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just do not buy nutrients, soil,
anything that is going to be consumed by
[SPEAKER_04]: you or your plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't purchase that at Home Depot,
Lowe's or Target.
[SPEAKER_04]: Only accessories made out of plastic or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get that kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lighting that's kind of gross store
specific still at this point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hobby Lobby sells Fisker scissors for
$12.99 as opposed to Home Depot and
[SPEAKER_04]: everywhere else is $19.99.
[SPEAKER_04]: The little titanium tip Fiskars trim
scissors.
Huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I do them cheaper than that,
but I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they had high grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they're $9.99 that row, we'll go get
them one love.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I forget that you guys change your names.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I can't, I'm not as involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the store anymore as I was.
[SPEAKER_04]: So is that the wife now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always been the wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to the wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, that's, that's her baby.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: She does a good job.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just in Springs.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I, if I were there, I'd shop there,
but I'm right up the street from the store
[SPEAKER_04]: in Springs that has, if I needed 14 bags
of soil, I don't know that you'd have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, nowadays we probably would,
but yeah, no, I understand.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Commercial orders are a little,
that's something we should mention
[SPEAKER_04]: commercial ordering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first time you want to figure out how
much fucking soil you need to fill all
[SPEAKER_04]: those pots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it's, that's a math challenge.
[SPEAKER_04]: You heard Jesse and I sit here and try to
figure out how much soil we needed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to go back to the
store a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't expect, uh, all stores, you're going
to be able to get commercial, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: quantities of things when you need them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to think ahead about stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You might have to start, uh, letting,
we let the store near us know that this
[SPEAKER_04]: is, these are products that we use on the
regular.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you keep these stocks, we'll buy them.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we come here and you don't have it,
we will drive directly to another store
[SPEAKER_04]: and get it cause we don't fuck around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it took them a couple of rhythms,
you know, it took them a couple,
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, you don't have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's coming Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_04]: The trucks come Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we, we kind of a job, we,
we compromise with the, we can't fuck with
[SPEAKER_04]: the day the trucks run.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's some shit we can't ask for.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we'll get it on your next order.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't fit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, like bring it on the
previous order.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are ordering a truckload of shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's a truck of your stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, uh, there's two, two main truckers
that they literally move.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say 70, 60 to 70% of the gross
stores, uh, or gross supplies sold in
[SPEAKER_02]: gross stores all across Colorado or up and
down the front range.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gary and James.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause there's probably one warehouse that
gets fucking everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's three main warehouses and then it
just gets distributed from there out to
[SPEAKER_02]: Pueblo Springs, Denver, a company named
Denver air is one of the only delivery
[SPEAKER_02]: companies that will work from Denver,
south on a daily route.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go to way to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go to grow generation.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go to all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Way to grow is my favorite.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going big, you're going big
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're in Pueblo and you want to buy
stuff for your small grow, definitely hit
[SPEAKER_04]: one love.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if, if you're big, huge, gigantic
county, a greenhouse grow, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: we already deal with a handful of half a
dozen clients out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know what it takes to, to service big
grows.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're in Pueblo and you're out
there in the county, go hit them up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know if they were able to handle
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go see them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll take care of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll get you a commercial account going
drop shipping.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just have to semi pull up to your
farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be just drop off loads of soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so much fun watching people carry all
your shit in for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, like Jesse said, he said to hire
somebody that knows what the fuck they're
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about when it comes to working
with your engineer to build the grow
[SPEAKER_04]: something super important.
[SPEAKER_04]: That just sounds egotistical coming from
myself and Jesse, but also hire a master
[SPEAKER_04]: grower that is a master grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, interview people, look at pictures,
the plants they've grown.
[SPEAKER_04]: I brought people to my home grow to show
them that I can grow on a commercial
[SPEAKER_04]: scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, here is what I can do.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you put me in a big grow, I can do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they trusted me and they gave me the
opportunity by seeing the cleanliness and
[SPEAKER_04]: the organization of my home grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you can go look at their grow before
you hire a master grower, do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're the business guy and you
think you're going to grow it yourself and
[SPEAKER_04]: be professional, you're going to fuck it
up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got faith in your skills.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got faith in your mind, but cannabis
is something that takes a lot of practice
[SPEAKER_04]: to learn.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like playing an instrument.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, you might have natural skill,
but you're not going to be Bon Jovi the
[SPEAKER_04]: first time you grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to fucking practice.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to tour a few times.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to have 10 cycles
under your belt before you even think
[SPEAKER_04]: about going big.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Easily full cycles from clone all the way
to drying and curing all the way to moving
[SPEAKER_04]: the packs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there's a lot to figure out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, my boss kids or my, my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: He gets down and dirty in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, and he's, he has this like
child like excitement about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never, I, I, well, I know hunt,
he gets down in the room to packs lots for
[SPEAKER_04]: me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll show hunt comes in at six in the
morning on a certain down Tuesdays.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hunt will be there at six in the morning
and I'll come in a couple of few hours
[SPEAKER_04]: later and he'll have a hundred pots filled
with soil being like, Hey, you can get all
[SPEAKER_04]: those transplants done today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got you a head start.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he sweeps, he sweeps the entire
facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I need him to, so does my guy takes out
trash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like he's like, bro, you're not here to
take out trash.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're here to grow cannabis, go grow
cannabis for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a below your pay grade.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that doesn't feel fair.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'm not too good to clean the
shitters and take out trash, but you're
[SPEAKER_04]: right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I should be hands on with the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels good though, to have,
to work for people that realize you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to do that stuff that you would do
it, but you don't want to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it feels good for them to,
you know, tell that you don't have to
[SPEAKER_02]: worry about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoy that part of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the time I get the giant facility
all to myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just put on headphones and yeah,
which makes me feel like sometimes I got
[SPEAKER_04]: to clean the shitters.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to sweep the floors.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mind doing it for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I go take a shit, I clean the
shitter when I'm done, just cause I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: want to be that guy leaving a hot seat and
some streaks for the next guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like rinsing your plate as soon as
you're done eating.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking some Windex right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just hose that bitch down and clean it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: For people that don't, don't know much
about the industry or don't live in
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado is not common at all to find
owners that are actually involved in the
[SPEAKER_02]: grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think me and Jeff are both fortunate to
work for people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, it's equally as common to
find rich dudes that own Porsche
[SPEAKER_04]: dealerships and want to double their
fucking money by opening a dispensary and
[SPEAKER_04]: being a dickhead to everybody and don't
know anything about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a few of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very similar stories.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very similar guys that just want to double
up cause they have a little bit of money.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's where my talk about hire a real
master grower loops around.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people want to hire their cousin
because they want to give their cousin a
[SPEAKER_04]: job or their nephew or their fucking
brother-in-law because he grew weed in the
[SPEAKER_02]: seventies and he talks a good game.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is your investment.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to cost you a million bucks to
get your, your grow and your dispensary
[SPEAKER_04]: going easily.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 600,000 for to get started.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you need like another 400 for
some payroll and whatever pops up and
[SPEAKER_04]: you're going to need a lawyer and an
accountant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a million bucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically a million dollars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just for a small, small facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our little facility, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So unless you trust your fucking cousin,
a million bucks worth, your future is on
[SPEAKER_04]: the line.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your business is on the line.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your grows on the line.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of us growers are weird people.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been taught to hide this for so many
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: The guys that are good at it did it like
when we were hiding it and we were kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: sketchy about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So sometimes some of our background
history on the application is a little
[SPEAKER_04]: vague.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes we've got a big furry ass beard.
[SPEAKER_04]: They could have squirrels hiding in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes you got dreadlocks down to your
ass.
[SPEAKER_04]: They could have the whole damn zoo hiding
in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't, we don't like sharing secrets.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't like to share too many secrets.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been fucked over before.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so hard by dispensary owners,
by street people, by friends, by family,
[SPEAKER_04]: things have gone wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're a little, we're a little
protective of ourselves and our knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard my boss say it the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Growers are some of the only people in the
industry that don't actually need a job.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could go make their own money doing
their.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate to say this, but I actually very
much need my job.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need more money being a black market
grower than I ever have in the legal
[SPEAKER_04]: industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't have to look over my shoulder
anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have to, when I hear ruffling
outside the front door too early,
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think the door is about to get
kicked the fuck in because I spent plenty
[SPEAKER_04]: of years of my life just wondering is
today the day they kick this fucker in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get a loan for a car.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get a loan for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard work, but it can get done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brand new car in the driveway that I
couldn't have done when I was a street
[SPEAKER_04]: hustler because now I've got paychecks and
pay studs and I pay taxes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I pay child support because I've
got a child that lives with their mom.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just because we don't live in the same
place, I'm required to fucking pay child
[SPEAKER_04]: support, which is cool with me instead of
just driving it over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to go through a system which
documents it being paid.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were always on my ass about my
income.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're paying child support, but we want
to know where your money comes from.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, why does it matter if the
bill gets paid?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just kept telling them like,
my mom pays it or my grandpa died.
[SPEAKER_04]: He left me money and just fucking told him
that kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now I'm like, Hey, look, I work at
this place and like, okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, so having a job, not looking over my
shoulder is well worth the difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the stress reduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although there's other stress that comes
from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: A different kind of stress, but just,
but now I can be, I, I am more proud of my
[SPEAKER_04]: grow now than I was when I was a black
market grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it was kind of cool having that thing
in the basement that nobody knew about.
[SPEAKER_04]: And why would disappear for fucking 12
hours at a time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where have you, what have you been doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been trimming weed, but I can't tell
you guys that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't feel good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just went home and took a nap.
[SPEAKER_04]: So hire yourself a master grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: We may look like weirdos.
[SPEAKER_04]: We might be tatted up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get yourself somebody that's on fucking
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody that doesn't think you drink and
do some drugs, but I've had some problems
[SPEAKER_04]: in the past with employees that have
recently hired that one guy was a party
[SPEAKER_04]: too hard the night before and was too
drunk to come to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I had another guy that,
uh, ate too many mushrooms the night
[SPEAKER_04]: before and tripped way too hard and had a
headache and couldn't come to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants don't care about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got a job to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I rely on you.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plants rely on you.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't show up and water those
plants, they're dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a business.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: If, if you don't show up on time and a
pump died overnight because pumps die,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're fired.
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole garden's dead.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're fucking fired.
[SPEAKER_04]: There goes your million dollar investment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So hire yourself a real master grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody that knows what they're doing,
not just your cousin.
[SPEAKER_04]: We might look like weirdos.
[SPEAKER_04]: We might be introverted.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, but if we're on time, we show
initiative, we're dedicated.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to be a soldier.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to be dedicated to the grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to respect the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to be able to build a relationship
with the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need something you can communicate
with someone that can multitask.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone that can deal with a contractor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone that's not going to be a dick when
the electrician shows up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone that's not going to run out the
back door and med shows up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You hand them all the compliance binders
with all your info and you tell them to
[SPEAKER_04]: have a good day and they get to sit there
and figure out what's wrong and they can't
[SPEAKER_04]: come in and check until they tell you they
need to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just hand them those compliance binders
and wait for them to find an issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go back to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And by the way, I'm not the owner.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can't even tell me shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll call the owner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Call the owner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't name meds here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing my job.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just go back to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like we've gone a long way in this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're an hour and 15 minutes in,
but there's a lot of good information.
[SPEAKER_04]: This con this podcast was everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a news education and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure what the news was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Terps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Terps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Terps are awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the news.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's official.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys Terps are awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Terps on Terps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Terps all day long.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to the Terps suite and all those
kids.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got one more thing written down on my
paper of notes that we need to talk about.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is the uncle bud company.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me all about the uncle bud company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uncle bud company is the company I'm
employed by.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a grow and a dispensary?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got an MIP and an OPC.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a MIP is a licensed
[SPEAKER_02]: MIP and an OPC.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a licensed MIP and an OPC.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a licensed MIP and an OPC.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're bringing out a line of edibles that
we're going through testing and approval,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a bit of a process right now,
but those will be on store shelves soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll also be bringing up,
I don't know how I can state it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're bringing a fractional distillate
product that's similar to a product called
[SPEAKER_02]: clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll be bringing our version of
terpenes to the wreck market.
[SPEAKER_04]: This distillate is the new stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me read the label on the distillate.
[SPEAKER_04]: that I've got, this is raw distillate.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is total potential cannabinoids,
94.1% cannabinoids total.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's broken down CBD,
1.1% THC, 90.94% THC in this distillate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's basically the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just taking RotoVap and everything
and pulling out the turpenoids,
[SPEAKER_04]: pulling out the cannabinoids and making
them into separate products.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another process in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we won't cover all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It involves something named after a farm
animal.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, that was really vague.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you said that you had edibles being
tested that would be coming out in the
[SPEAKER_04]: market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are those only going to be available at
the Uncle Bud company or are those going
[SPEAKER_04]: to be available at recreational and or
medical shops statewide?
[SPEAKER_02]: We are a wholesaler.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have a storefront as of yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so much easier that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our CO2 oil right now, I know here in
Pueblo, it's available at The Spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also available at The Spot in
Trinidad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your CO2 oil that you guys made.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a recreational product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes.
All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: The edible products we're coming up with
at the moment, we've got a barbecue sauce
[SPEAKER_02]: that's going through the proving process.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Barbecue sauce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, the people that own my company are
from Georgia and Texas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people are going to be high as fuck
because barbecue sauce is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, it's so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many milligrams of THC per serving?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's part of the thing we're figuring
out right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a bottle's got to be limited at 100
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to be a smaller bottle.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it'll be like two servings.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 50 milligrams a serving.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're going to make some ribs,
you can just squirt the whole bottle
[SPEAKER_04]: across some ribs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the heat when you're cooking the ribs
going to fuck up my medicine?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the things we've got to
figure out.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, there's a whole, I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a vegetarian, you guys, so I'm just
hypothetically talking about barbecue ribs
[SPEAKER_04]: over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no idea of the proving process the
state requires for a new style edible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's rigorous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're doing popcorn balls too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, popcorn balls are huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had some popcorn balls that were coated
and clear.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, dude, that was high.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's part of the, a lot of our demand
we've been getting for clear right now is
[SPEAKER_02]: coming from edibles manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause they don't want any smell or any
taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes it so much easier and it's
easier.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more viscous.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easier to work with.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not chunky like BHO.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a higher percentage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's easier to work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easier to redo the math and
everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I shout out to my friends at TNT
extractions.
[SPEAKER_04]: They gave me a 1000 milligram chocolate
bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of like biting into,
it tastes like, they told me that there's
[SPEAKER_04]: a gram and a half of shatter melted into
that chocolate bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: It tasted like they just took a gram and a
half of shatter into a chocolate bar and
[SPEAKER_04]: just dropped the shatter directly into the
chocolate bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause when I bit into it, it was
chocolate, chocolate, chocolate hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had to chew through the hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like, okay, chocolate again,
chocolate, chocolate, chocolate.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the hash was like my teeth,
you know, when you take a dab and your
[SPEAKER_04]: lips get sticky, my teeth were like,
they're making this noise.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I pull them apart, they'd sound like
when I pulled them apart, they would do
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, damn, I'm hashy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got so high that I made a list of things
to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I went to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ate it and went to fucking work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bad idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: I made a list of shit to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would read on the list, water
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd walk to the water and turn on the
hose and be like, what was I about to do?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, was I going to water some plants?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure what was about to happen,
but I haven't eaten any edibles since that
[SPEAKER_04]: day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been a little bit leery of edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had an incident a few weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear some action at the front door.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's wrap up this podcast,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate you for coming and doing an
hour and 20 minute podcast with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks to Bern for letting me borrow your
husband for an hour and a half and taking
[SPEAKER_04]: some dabs with me.

listen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stitcher is number two.
[SPEAKER_04]: You really see your, uh, your like
comments and shit will come in on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least we're not just stuck on sound
cloud now, which is like probably number
[SPEAKER_02]: 12 or 14.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can't listen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even have sound cloud on my phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd have to go through your Facebook
post and then use the link.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it was just a pain in the,
and then if I get a call, then I have to
[SPEAKER_04]: start the episode over.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that sucked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only thing I use sound cloud
for is just to check our show.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's as soon as we're on stage.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you played with your, uh,
your, uh, your statistics yet,
[SPEAKER_04]: your metrics on Stitcher?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I haven't.

to go look and see what your ranking is
[SPEAKER_04]: and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first night I kind of looked at it,
but it didn't have any info.
