[SPEAKER_01]: So that's right stay tuned keep listening
because SeedsHereNow.com and iReadGenetics
[SPEAKER_01]: have teamed up to give away another pack
of seeds on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right I don't want to ramble too far.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like I get really good at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a lot to cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's jump into the email portion of
today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first episode on today's podcast came
from our friend who would like to be
[SPEAKER_01]: referred to as Soul Train.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my friend Soul Train.
[SPEAKER_01]: The message goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, Yo Rasta Jeff if you should
happen to reference on this show please
[SPEAKER_01]: refer to me as Soul Train.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up Soul Train.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for all the support my dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: The message continues.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I am working my way through all of
your older podcasts and I just listened to
[SPEAKER_01]: episode number 580.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of catching up to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for listening to all the old
episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys people keep asking me for more
content new content multiple podcasts a
[SPEAKER_01]: week.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard for me to do that right now with
my my work and living and my whole life
[SPEAKER_01]: situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: One podcast is a week a week is what I can
do but there are a lot of older episodes
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can go back and listen to.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many many episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are apparently 785 episodes before
this one that you can go back and listen
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately YouTube has taken down a few
of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I show plants in the videos YouTube
likes to take down those videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a video where I cut clones that
they took down.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a video about popping and twisting
and lollipopping that they have taken
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've taken down a lot of the videos
where I do any sort of consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: But YouTube takes some down other than
YouTube taking them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the videos are still up and
available 785 other videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first 20 videos the podcast was called
something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called I Grow Culture for a little
while for 20 episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I was informed politely and gently
with the by the form of a cease and desist
[SPEAKER_01]: letter that I Grow Culture was already
something being used and I could not use
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we promptly changed the name to the
Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: My point is those first 20 episodes are
shared in a playlist on the Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_01]: Heart podcast on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to my playlist you can find
those or if you search I Grow Culture
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast those first 20 episodes do come
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 780 ish episodes are available of this
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys if you haven't had enough of
this rambling of this beautiful face of
[SPEAKER_01]: this amazing voice please go back and
listen to those previous episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our friend here Soul Train just listened
to number 580 and they say in that podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: you answered a listener question
concerning purple petioles and you
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned if the plant is also showing
crispy leaves it is likely too much light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes that from what I've read in the rest
of your email that is definitely the case
[SPEAKER_01]: of what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me just keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says you will be pleased that the least
affected strains in the grow are the
[SPEAKER_01]: machine and the blue pill with the blue
pill being far by far the happiest looking
[SPEAKER_01]: plant in the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on though it says well I'm only in
my first indoor grow with several
[SPEAKER_01]: different strains and about half of the
plants have purple petioles and all of
[SPEAKER_01]: them now are getting some crispy looking
leaves with this being worse on the more
[SPEAKER_01]: purple petioles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plants that have the more purple
petioles are showing the purple crispy
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just trying to put a bunch of peas
into a sense to be silly there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says however at six weeks into 1212 the
buds on all of the plants are looking
[SPEAKER_01]: good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this you just keep us solidifying the
idea that yes the light is too intense is
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I am growing in a five by five
tent with an HLG scorpion Diablo light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not super familiar with that light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have heard a lot about I know that HLG
makes great shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people run that light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that it is quite powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I had the light set 16 inches over
the canopy at 50 percent intensity and
[SPEAKER_01]: things were getting crispy about 10 days
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lifted the light to 26 inches over the
canopy at 50 percent intensity and the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants sure do look happier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are giving supporting statements
supporting evidence that this is probably
[SPEAKER_01]: a light issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got that light a little bit too
close maybe turned up too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did the right thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You raised that plant when you get those
new LED lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would definitely do whoever you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking to everybody out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get a new LED light I highly
recommend doing some research research
[SPEAKER_01]: that particular light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find out how far they recommend you put
that plant or that light from your canopy
[SPEAKER_01]: and then go a little bit further and then
also reduce the intensity a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more than they recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we've seen here these plants they've
taken too much light.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will start to burn the leaves will
start to crisp up they'll turn purple that
[SPEAKER_01]: will slow down the growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things will go wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get too much light the leaves crisp
up and you can't fix that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not getting enough light the
plants will start to stretch and get a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit extended.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can turn up the light and fix that more
easily than we can take back the crispy
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So start lower and slowly wrap yourself
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be something we talk about
here toward the end of this message.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I did spend a bunch of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I spend a bunch of money on the wrong
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also is there a strategy I can use for the
remaining four weeks that will allow will
[SPEAKER_01]: allow me to increase the intensity setting
on the light for my next grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe I will induce CO2
supplementation that will absolutely help.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll help with food uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll help the plants take more light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll also help them manage a little bit
more heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then it says thanks for all you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Signed from your friend Soul Train.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little personal joke in there
that I almost read out loud that is just
[SPEAKER_01]: between us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot share that with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fist bump for the funny joke bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our friend Soul Train you are
absolutely right by moving that light up
[SPEAKER_01]: by assuming that the light was too
intense.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the major questions that you ask in
here is did I spend a bunch of money on
[SPEAKER_01]: the wrong light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you lifted the light to the top
of the tent and turn it down and the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants are small.
[SPEAKER_01]: That intensity for the small plants should
work out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then here's what I want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I would have done.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too late to do this now.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I'm going to suggest you do
in the future and on future runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I would do is raise that light all
the way up and turn it as low as it will
[SPEAKER_01]: let you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably 50 or 30 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of those lights only go down to about
50 or 30.
[SPEAKER_01]: So raise the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turn it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then start your seedlings or your small
plants down on the very low part of that
[SPEAKER_01]: tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got as much space as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then pay attention to how those plants are
acting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you need to lower the light a little
bit or do you need to raise the intensity
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay attention if they're getting stretchy,
if they're getting leggy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may want a little bit more light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may recommend lowering that light at
this time just a little tiny bit and do
[SPEAKER_01]: not increase the intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just lower the light down so that you can
get that light closer to the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then as the plants begin to grow you can
turn that light up just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say turn it up just a small
fraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just maybe five percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe 10 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a little bit as they start growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then if you start seeing shaded shadowy
areas in the tent and the plants aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: growing the maximum efficiency,
maybe turn it up just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then raise that light all the way to the
top and then now what I do know is when I
[SPEAKER_01]: use the Canon LEDs is that I like to have
them about 50 percent intensity when I put
[SPEAKER_01]: my plants into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I start I think those go to like 30
percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I start vegging.
[SPEAKER_01]: I slowly crank them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They veg a little more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I slowly crank them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They veg a little more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I slowly crank them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time I go into flower my lights are
at 50 percent intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then every week or two I just knock it up
just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to get 10 weeks in flower
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to go up to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know if we need to go to 100
percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to pay attention to what the
plants need which is going to lead me into
[SPEAKER_01]: the next part that I want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would slowly ramp that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go from low intensity just cranking
it all up all the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would start low and then slowly over.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got these plants in there for 100
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go from 50 to 100 percent over that 100
day period.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may not even need to max it all the
way out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something that we do need to think
about though.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can give them too much light.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can also give them the wrong spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're not getting the right color
then that's too much wasted light.
[SPEAKER_01]: But something else we should talk about is
DLI.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants will take up so much light and
then they will simply have had enough and
[SPEAKER_01]: they will shut off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can save electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can save lighting by figuring out the
DLI of your specific plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The daily light integral hit that point
and then reduce or cut off the lights to
[SPEAKER_01]: save that electricity and that photon
energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's something else we should talk
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the technical way to figure out if
your plants are getting enough light.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to take some equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a PAR meter here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some sort of a meter that will read how
much light is getting to your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the cell phone makers do have a
decent app for a PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: However I would recommend a real PAR meter
for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cell phone apps are not 100 percent
perfect yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now if you're going to use a PAR meter we
are looking for a range of 500 to 700
[SPEAKER_01]: PPFD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what is PPFD?
[SPEAKER_01]: This term was all the rage.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the hot phrase.
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to be terps for a minute and then
it was phenotype for a little while and
[SPEAKER_01]: then for a little while PPFD was the word
in the grow industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is PPFD?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is photosynthetic photon flux
density.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does that really mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand a lot about lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me admit right now when it comes to
lighting in cannabis that is where I lack
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know about the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand the processes of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand most of everything that needs
to be done to a cannabis plant but
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting my brain just doesn't want to
absorb that bit of information.
[SPEAKER_01]: My brain isn't interested and my brain's
not interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have a hard time learning about
that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a very rudimentary understanding of
lighting so let me try to teach you a very
[SPEAKER_01]: general understanding of PPFD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Photosynthetic photon flux density.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I said it correctly even.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay think about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how we measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say that you've got your light above you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine you could see little raindrops of
light falling down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's basically what we're measuring.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many raindrops of light are coming
down from your light and we'll measure at
[SPEAKER_01]: certain distances from that light to find
out the intensity of that light at certain
[SPEAKER_01]: distances.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at your canopy I would use a PAR meter
and the desired PPFD at canopy level is
[SPEAKER_01]: between 500 and 700.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the range that you are looking
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a PAR meter or an app or an app
on your phone to find that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not something that you can do with
your eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a meter for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'd hold the meter right at canopy
level and see is that between 500 and 700
[SPEAKER_01]: PPFD.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's too hot too much light of course
turn those lights down or raise the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's too much do the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Increase the light or lower the light
closer to the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is when you lower the light you
get a little bit more shadow area because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not spreading as far but it is more
intense.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you raise that light you will get less
shadows but it is not intense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of the things that you've
got to figure out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a thousand is really high.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're hitting that thousand PPFD your
plants are going to start showing
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're under 500 you're not going to
get that optimal growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again it seems to me in my studies
and the cannabis realm and everything I've
[SPEAKER_01]: looked at online that between 500 and 700
PPFD is ideal for our ganja plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think you are spot on with your first
assumption that these plants are just
[SPEAKER_01]: getting a little bit too much light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the second part of your question was
your concern that you spent too much money
[SPEAKER_01]: on this light and you wasted all that
money on too much light for your space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that is the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you've got a good quality light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if we figure out how far to keep
that light from the canopy then we'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: in big business because that's a quality
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good company and I've never heard
bad things about that light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as long as we keep the appropriate
distance between the light and the canopy
[SPEAKER_01]: and we turn that light down to the
appropriate PPFD the right intensity then
[SPEAKER_01]: we should get that dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing the main thing I'm going to
recommend is slowly ramping up the
[SPEAKER_01]: intensity of that light.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need all of the light on the
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just need a little bit of light and
as they get bigger then they can
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolize more.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be more functional.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can handle more light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe wait till they're a little bit
bigger to start giving them that super
[SPEAKER_01]: intense light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my main advice is to next time slowly
ramp up that light and then pay attention
[SPEAKER_01]: to the PPFD.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can get that par meter and measure
the PPFD at canopy level you will be
[SPEAKER_01]: golden my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right Soul Train thanks once again for
the great message.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were six weeks into flower when you
sent this you have probably harvested by
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really curious how did this crop turn
out?
[SPEAKER_01]: How did it look?
[SPEAKER_01]: How did it smell?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you got to sample it yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: And also let's get that next crop on
track.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got any questions please do
reach out we'll get you going.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right this next email came from our
friend Zach J.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to our buddy Zach J.
[SPEAKER_01]: for the good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says yo Rasta Jeff I just discovered
what I believe are whiteflies and or
[SPEAKER_01]: fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing I would do there bro is
identify if you've got whiteflies and or
[SPEAKER_01]: fungus gnats or both.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very possible that you've got both.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very likely that you've got both but
if you've only got one or the other it may
[SPEAKER_01]: be easier to treat for just one if we know
more specifically what we are targeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or we may have to use multiple methods of
attack here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the first step is identify which one
you are battling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they white?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they look like a little piece of rice
on the stems?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you tap the pots does it look like
ashes come flying out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are they little black bugs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: The white ones are the whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should be obvious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's identify which one we have got in
the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little bit here that we're gonna
skip but then it goes on to say I've
[SPEAKER_01]: already ordered neem oil without doing a
whole lot of research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any thoughts on neem oil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Also does a new layer of all-purpose sand
on top of the soil change the way I need
[SPEAKER_01]: to feed or water my plants at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Much love and respect from Zach.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right this is a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whiteflies and fungus gnats are very very
common in a grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come in house plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come in all of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you buy a bagged potting soil a
soilless mix almost anything in a bag from
[SPEAKER_01]: a grow store whether it's like your local
Randy's Grow or Mike's Grow shop or if
[SPEAKER_01]: it's Grow Generation or Way to Grow or if
it's Home Depot or Lowe's or even Target
[SPEAKER_01]: had Fox Farm soil the last time I was
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that soil people want to blame
specific brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got this bug from this soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That soil's got this bug in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nah bro all the bugs are in all of the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are made in different places but then
they're shipped to a warehouse where
[SPEAKER_01]: they're all put on a pallet together.
[SPEAKER_01]: On a dock together put on a pallet put on
a truck and moved around the country
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think the whiteflies went hey I
like I like Fox Farms better or hey I like
[SPEAKER_01]: Roots Organics better.
[SPEAKER_01]: They went there's a bunch of places to
live and they went in all the fucking soil
[SPEAKER_01]: and they lived in all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just all about where that soil came
from was stored how it traveled what it
[SPEAKER_01]: got exposed to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your responsibility as the farmer to
make sure that there are no bugs in your
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway my point is the whiteflies and
fungus gnats they're very easy to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come from all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very common.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet many many growers have had them in
their grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fungus gnats are not that big of a
deal when there's only a couple of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just kind of annoying.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gross.
[SPEAKER_01]: They bug you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make the pictures look like shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They remind you that you over watered a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you get a lot of fungus gnats
then they can become a vector for disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a problem in one plant those
fungus gnats will just move that root
[SPEAKER_01]: disease right over to the other plants or
whatever is going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a small problem and fungus
gnats the problem compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with the whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of whiteflies they just look
annoying.
[SPEAKER_01]: After a little bit you get a bunch of
whiteflies and it's gross and you're like
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a major fucking problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just a hint of the overall health
of the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whiteflies and fungus gnats are very
common.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the most common causes of these
bugs is simply well they come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's either not caused they arrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reason they stick around is
because of over watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like to be around in that moist soil
that soil right around where your pot
[SPEAKER_01]: drips into the saucer right around there
where there's always that little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a dry spot for them to be safe but
enough moisture for them to lay some eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a party get some water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like the Bahamas there for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where they like to chill.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whiteflies like to chill just above
the top of the soil and climb up your
[SPEAKER_01]: sticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like to live right on the the stalks
of your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are very common bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are very easy to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the first question the first attempt
here was that our listener Zach J thought
[SPEAKER_01]: about using neem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to cut you off right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not like neem oil for anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no application for neem in my
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact in the state of Colorado according
to the Colorado Department of Health and
[SPEAKER_01]: Environment and the Colorado Department of
Ag and the Colorado Medical or the
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division
all neem based products are banned in
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't use neem and cannabis at all
legally in commercial cultivation in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do it in our homegrown because
we're not regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I refuse to use neem for several
reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all it tastes and smells like
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get neem on your gloves on your
skin on your clothes in anywhere it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to stink so bad forever and it never
ever goes away.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've ever tasted neem it is one of
the worst tasting things ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you smoke flowers or a concentrated
product and it tastes a little bit fishy
[SPEAKER_01]: and oily and maybe a little bit spicy that
possibly probably was because there was
[SPEAKER_01]: neem oil applied to that flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: The neem oil never goes away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be there forever in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I can always taste it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That might be in my mind but I think neem
is gross and also there are many toxic
[SPEAKER_01]: traits to neem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neem has been banned in many countries for
many uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's known to do reproductive damage to
men and women and it's not good for the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment or your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a few reasons why I don't
recommend to use neem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just tastes like shit and it doesn't go
away and there are better options.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that I told you I don't like the
product you said that you've already
[SPEAKER_01]: ordered which I do apologize for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about products that will help
you to get rid of these white flies and or
[SPEAKER_01]: fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing step one is let's identify
positively identify what we are battling.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're battling just white flies I'm
going to recommend just one product.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're battling fungus gnats I'm going
to recommend a different product.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we've got them both we may mix up these
products together and spray them at the
[SPEAKER_01]: same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on how strong these bugs are
attacking and which one it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's fungus gnats they are in the
they're more living in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're white flies they're a little
bit in the soil and more on the stalks and
[SPEAKER_01]: under the foliage of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two different means of treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two different modes of attack.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's identify the bugs that you've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the very first step.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second step is let's stop over
watering these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did address that here in the message
you understand that part of the problem is
[SPEAKER_01]: from over watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's reduce the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also is there standing water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if your grow is in a
commercial building if it's in your home
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's in a hotel if it's a train station
if it's in the city if it's on a farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know any of those environmental
factors but possibly you've got water
[SPEAKER_01]: standing somewhere else or a source of
moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somewhere else those white flies and
fungus gnats will be drawn to that source
[SPEAKER_01]: of moisture as well as well as all of the
other insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to come to the water first
warm water aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bugs are going to show up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get rid of the water the over
water the excessive water the lingering
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like mosquitoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to come where there's water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's identify a couple of pesticides
that I would recommend for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start with the white flies.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've just got white flies I would do
a little bit of defoliation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably need to defoliate anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: The white flies are going to be hiding
under the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's pull off some leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's glove up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's put on some clothes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't really like a whole lot and go
defoliate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just go manually remove a bunch of
the white flies from the room and also
[SPEAKER_01]: remove their hotel take away their party
spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: They won't come to party.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's defoliate a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put all of those defoliated leaves into a
trash bag that you can tie up and seal and
[SPEAKER_01]: remove from the grow environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a fire pit put that bad
bitch in the fire pit and burn those
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want those white flies coming
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do a little bit of defoliation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now here's another trick that you may
laugh at but this is definitely going to
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a shop vac and I put the shop vac
nozzles kind of big.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a little taper device that makes
the shop vac nozzle smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will smack the plants with a stick and
as the white flies come flying out I suck
[SPEAKER_01]: them up with the shop vac.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to fly directly to the
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay right there near the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smack the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come flying out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just sucking them up as they come
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one good way to get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to suck up a bunch into the
vacuum.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got the shop vac with a filter
bag in there I recommend that because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're tiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to catch the little fuckers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So defoliate shop vac a bunch of them off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then at this point this is when I would
consider when I would consider a foliar
[SPEAKER_01]: application of a product called Monterey
garden spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually don't recommend specific
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody pays me for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the product to use for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a beneficial bacteria in Monterey
garden spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it BT.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be pronounced bacillus
thuringiensis or something similar to
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not the best guy at pronouncing shit
but I can read well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see it on the paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recognize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That ingredient in that product is going
to eliminate the white flies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a fungus that occurs in the bottom
of rum barrels and they've learned how to
[SPEAKER_01]: make a pesticide out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We apply that to the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is basically harmless to the plants but
the white flies they want nothing to do
[SPEAKER_01]: with it so that BT will get rid of the
white flies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will also slow down your fungus
gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's focus more on the fungus gnat
and the white fly combination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say you got both of these bad
bitches attacking the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: The white flies like I mentioned are going
to stay mainly on the foliage.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may go a little bit into your dirt
but they're going to stay mostly on the
[SPEAKER_01]: foliage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mostly on the underside of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fungus gnats are going to burrow down
into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fungus gnats are going to be down
in your roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to take care of them we need to do more
than just spraying a foliar application.
[SPEAKER_01]: We may need to do what is called a soil
dredge.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is where you take an amount of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much you ever water your plants
usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mix up that much water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get that much water and to that mix of
water we are going to add 15 to 30
[SPEAKER_01]: milliliters per gallon of evergreen
pyrethrum spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: The product is called evergreen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mainly pyrethrum based.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very good product for getting rid
of fungus gnats, white flies and most of
[SPEAKER_01]: your basic common pests in the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly this is one of my go-to
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my most recommended pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is simply called evergreen.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion it's affordable and it's
very effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is also approved by the Colorado
Department of Agriculture, the Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: Department of Public Health and
Environment and the Colorado Marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: Enforcement Division.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the product is called evergreen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would mix up the water and I would water
the plants with the evergreen solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again somewhere between 15 and 30
milliliters of evergreen per gallon of
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: 15 to 30 per gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to mix up that water and
water it right through the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will stress the root zone of your
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants will show you that they were a
little bit bothered by this but one maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: two applications of this will get rid of
your soil borne pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of anything in that soil will go
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So depending on the level of the
infestation and the strength of your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that would help me determine how
much of this product to put in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somewhere between 15 and 30 milliliters.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the bugs are real bad you want that 30
milliliters but if the roots aren't super
[SPEAKER_01]: strong go closer to 15 milliliters.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can figure this one out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mix that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water the plants then wait a couple of
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then water it again with this same
solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they didn't look to beat up the first
time do it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they got the shit beat out of them on
the first try maybe wait on this but then
[SPEAKER_01]: water them again with the same solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: That second application should knock out
all of the root borne problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then after that I recommend watering with
a really nice mix of nutrients and put a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of microbes in there to resupply the
microbes to that rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get everything back in action in that pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bugs are gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get the roots banging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get the roots healthy again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now while I'm doing these root dredges I
would also do a foliar application of
[SPEAKER_01]: either the Monterey garden spray or the
evergreen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hit the top and the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we just soak the soil or the cocoa or
whatever the plants are in the bugs are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to go up and hang out on the leaves
and fly around and just go other places
[SPEAKER_01]: and then when all that shit dries they'll
go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to hit the foliage too so there's
nowhere for these bugs to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hit the foliage with the evergreen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hit the soil with the evergreen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would do the foliar spray and the dredge
on the first day and then wait two or
[SPEAKER_01]: three days maybe four days depending on
your wet and dry cycles and do it all over
[SPEAKER_01]: again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now all the bugs should be gone with those
two applications if it is fungus gnats and
[SPEAKER_01]: or white flies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other pests may have a little more
resistance but that should bang out your
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really quickly if it's fungus gnats
then we're going to use evergreen at 15 to
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 milliliters per gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do a soil dredge and a
foliar application then we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: wait three maybe five days and repeat the
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it is only white flies let's just spray
frequently with the Monterey garden spray
[SPEAKER_01]: with the bacillus thuringiensis in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hit that like day one day three day
six and then we'll wait and see how they
[SPEAKER_01]: look maybe do it again on day ten but they
should be going away by then.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not you've got a bigger problem than I
realized we've got to get in there and
[SPEAKER_01]: make some nuclear measures or perhaps
start thinking about letting go some of
[SPEAKER_01]: those predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are plenty of predator bugs that
will get in there and destroy your fungus
[SPEAKER_01]: gnats and your white flies.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right my friend Zach J I think I
answered most of your question on my notes
[SPEAKER_01]: here it says bacillus thuringiensis from
Monterey garden spray or evergreen stop
[SPEAKER_01]: over watering shop vac.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing I wrote down was yellow
cards.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd recommend putting some yellow sticky
traps in the garden some at soil level
[SPEAKER_01]: some right below the bottom of the canopy
and some at the top of the canopy that
[SPEAKER_01]: will help you identify the presence of
pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those yellow sticky traps are not there to
eradicate bugs in any way.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are there to alert and indicate the
presence of pests that will let you
[SPEAKER_01]: monitor your progress in your battle.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there are more there yesterday than
there are today you're making progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's more there tomorrow than there
were today they're making progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to adjust your your measures
based on the progress which you and those
[SPEAKER_01]: bugs are making.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a battle and I wish you the best of
luck.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna win bro because you've got
technology and me on your side and you
[SPEAKER_01]: were backed by the iry army.
