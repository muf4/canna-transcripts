[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 243 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, This My Friends is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, we need to send a huge thank
you shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_00]: For letting me use their music on my
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to Kat, Koosh, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, this podcast is
brought to you by our friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new, regular, or feminized
seeds, check out thedankteam.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thedankteam.com carries Alphacronic,
Canaventure, Rare Dankness, Irie Genetics,

[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking to expand your lineup or
start fresh from seed, I highly recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dank Team.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get too far, let me make an
apology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put up a Throwback Thursday episode and
for some reason, Stitcher did not grab it,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I had to repost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of you folks look forward to
the Throwback Thursday episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people tell me that they get them
through their long work day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize that Stitcher failed to grab
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did repost it as soon as I was notified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friend that let me know
that the episode failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if he wants me to say his
name on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said his name before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out, Kelvin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for helping me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: For letting me know that Stitcher did not
pick up the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens, you guys, I put the episode
up to my website and then Stitcher and
[SPEAKER_00]: iTunes and all the other services grab it
and they post it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some reason, Stitcher has been missing
all of my episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't grab it appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to go back and repost it
specifically for Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've emailed them a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take forever to respond.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time they respond, I've already
corrected the issue myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will keep an eye on it and I will keep
the episodes coming and keep it issue
free.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Stitcher for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for everybody that listens on
Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that sucks about Stitcher,
there's not a lot of good ways for you to
[SPEAKER_00]: leave comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can leave them on the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can leave them on the page,
but it's hard for me to find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to go search each episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing notifies me that I've got a review
or a comment there on Stitcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to find them, but I
appreciate your comments and reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of comments and reviews,
I want to start the podcast by reading the
[SPEAKER_00]: most recent iTunes reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me turn down the music and get right
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to leave
a review, a rating and a review on iTunes,
[SPEAKER_00]: simply go to iTunes, go to the iTunes
store, search for the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Halfway down the middle, there's a little
icon, the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a red, gold, and green flag with my
face on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then somewhere toward the middle of the
page, there's a spot that says ratings and
[SPEAKER_00]: reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, so far, you guys, I have gotten 65
ratings and they're all five star ratings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like 55 people have left customer
reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, they've all been satisfied
listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would appreciate it if you go and leave
a rating and a review and I will read your
[SPEAKER_00]: review on a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the first
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, let's see, this one is from
a person that calls himself Spanky12345687
[SPEAKER_00]: and they left this review on August 31st
and it says, fucking gnarly show main,
[SPEAKER_00]: stay black.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm white as fuck, but I'll stay
black.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll stay black.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fucking gnarly show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you appreciate my fucking gnarly
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would get along.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell just cause you left such a cool
comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for listening to Spanky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you appreciate the fucking gnarly
show main and I will do my best to stay
[SPEAKER_00]: black.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next review was left on September 12th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm reading this just in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: September 12th, a person by the name of
mangledremains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks for putting your
mangledremains together enough to listen
[SPEAKER_00]: to the podcast and leave a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: The review goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for doing a more grow oriented
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heard your show called out of the Dude
Grows podcast today and absolutely enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: First episode I listened to was about
Scrogging and found it very informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sir have gained yourself another
listener.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, mangledremains, thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for subscribing and super huge
thanks for the five star review and the
[SPEAKER_00]: good rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, also while we're at it, big shout out
to my friends at the Dude Grows podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another podcast about growing
cannabis called the Dude Grows show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Scotty and the dude and they hang out
and they talk about recharge a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: and they talk about growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not able to listen to that show as
much as I would like to, but I do catch a
[SPEAKER_00]: few episodes here and there and it's a
great podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're all caught up on grow from your
heart podcast episodes and you're all
[SPEAKER_00]: caught up on the split podcast,
I recommend you check out the Dude Grows
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really good cannabis related
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are buddies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hang out at the Dude Grows cup every
year with those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will do a little partying together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may do an episode together in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's get back on track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, mangledremains and spanky12345687.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your iTunes reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the five star ratings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if anybody else wants to leave a
review, I would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the Mystic Roots man for
letting me play all of their music on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've given me consent written
permission and I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the two most recent iTunes
comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you guys for leaving them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last week, I teased that I would be
reading emails from a couple of listeners
[SPEAKER_00]: from down south.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got those emails in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just picking randomly which one goes
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: This email, I'm looking to see if they use
a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope, they don't use a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, my new friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in Georgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife and I are planning to move to a
greener state next May or June,
[SPEAKER_00]: most likely Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some family in the Springs and I
have lived there before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado Springs is about 45 minutes north
of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a military town.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a bad place.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are one of the few towns or cities
with actual smoke clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the Canna Canyon is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the Dab Lounge is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where a lot of these smoke places
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Colorado Springs is not a bad place.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person goes on to say, I want to get
into the industry growing eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I currently have little to no experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have kids, so an illegal grow is not an
option.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have inspected and consulted a few local
growers with basic problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I lack in experience, I make up for
in knowledge and research skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to be as proactive as possible
without getting any charges.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very smart of you, especially since
you said you've got children in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a cool way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to other folks' gardens and
learning in there, then you can leave and
[SPEAKER_00]: not be part of anything that goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should anything go wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty smooth move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you go on to say, I read,
listen, learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no college, but I feel like all
information is locked up in books,
[SPEAKER_00]: not buildings.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is, what advice would you give
an uneducated family man with nothing more
[SPEAKER_00]: than a deep passion for marijuana and a
lot of determination that wants to get
[SPEAKER_00]: into the industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you ask a couple more questions,
but we're off to a great start.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing that you're going to have
to think about is can you get your badge?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that works in the state of
Colorado marijuana industry, the regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, it's a marijuana enforcement
regulated industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that works there has to undergo
a thorough background check.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are three levels of badges.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are support badges, there's a key
badge, and there is an owner badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each badge costs more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get an owner badge, you actually have
to be a license holder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to own the license of the
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get a key badge, a key badge is for
somebody, I've got a key badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: A key is for somebody who has got keys,
somebody who would make decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There has to be a key badge person on
premises at all times if there are other
[SPEAKER_00]: people in the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got somebody with a support
badge, there has to be a key badge in the
[SPEAKER_00]: building around them at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: A key badge is ideal if you're going to
move into the industry and plan on having
[SPEAKER_00]: any sort of management position or any
sort of authority within the grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to want to get the key badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: The support badge is how you get your foot
in the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trimmers are only required to have a
support badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blood tenders are only required to have a
support badge, but you are limited on
[SPEAKER_00]: tasks and duties and jobs you can perform,
which means you are limited on income you
[SPEAKER_00]: can receive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, as you move up in the cannabis
industry, your pay increases drastically
[SPEAKER_00]: from a trimmer to a grow tech to the lead
cultivator to the consultants to whoever
[SPEAKER_00]: else you've got in the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of people that you guys,
there are lawyers, there are consultants,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are packagers, there are advertising
people, there are accountants,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's payroll.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of people in different
departments, but as you move up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you certainly do make more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the support badge is a good start.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key badge is where you want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing you need to do,
Google, how do I get my Colorado Marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: Enforcement Division support badge or a
key badge?
[SPEAKER_00]: Google it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will take you to I think it's the
Marijuana Enforcement Division website.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a page in there with about
10 questions, and it says if you say yes
[SPEAKER_00]: to any of these questions, you are not
able to get a badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not remember the technical parts off
the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got drug felonies within like
five or 10 years, I think that excludes
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got felonies within the last
five years of some sort, that excludes
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are just certain things that will
exclude you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to have your student loans.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need to be paid off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be showing progress that
you're paying them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pay child support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to show that my child support is
current and that I'm not fucking up my
[SPEAKER_00]: child support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once I provided a copy of that,
they're like, oh yeah, all your stuff's
[SPEAKER_00]: current.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's your badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my badge because my appointment was
at 10 in the morning and I had my badge by
[SPEAKER_00]: five o'clock that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I wanted to stay in Colorado Springs,
I could have picked it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had them mail it to me because I didn't
want to stick around in Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have anything to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drove home and just had them mail it,
but I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My appointment was at 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was done by five and ready for me to
pick up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how long it took for me to get
my badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got stuff on your record,
you may have to bring paperwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to show that all of your
court records, that all of your
[SPEAKER_00]: obligations for court have been completed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were required to do classes or pay
fines or do whatever, you need to show
[SPEAKER_00]: that that's been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got any sort of court cases,
all of it needs to be tied up or shown
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're handling it responsibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first thing I would do before this,
the next line in the email is,
[SPEAKER_00]: what can I do until we move?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing, look and see if you were
even eligible to get a badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've never been in trouble before,
you're just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have any outstanding debts,
any student loans, anything like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: child support, bad taxes, you'll be just
fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got some fuck ups in your past,
you may need to check out what you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: do to correct that so that you can get the
badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing you can do until you move,
it seems to be like you're on the right
[SPEAKER_00]: path.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read a lot of books about growing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read the most up to date books about
growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever a new book comes out about
growing cannabis, read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go back and read all the old books about
growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read all of Jorge Savante's Grow Bibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read all the Ed Rosenthal books.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read all of the Greg Green books.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many authors in my head that
won't come out right now because I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to say them.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I quit thinking about authors,
they'll all come to my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would for sure recommend DJ Short's new
book.
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ Short just recently put out another
book.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I would recommend, I'm pretty
sure Greg Green wrote the Cannabis Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also wrote the Cannabis Breeders Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would heavily recommend those books.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I would recommend podcasts,
not just mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend a lot of cannabis
podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a show called Free Weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free Weed is part of what inspired this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free Weed was a pretty good show.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some great info to come out of
that podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing I didn't like was if you asked a
grow question, if you said, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got spider mites, the host of the
show wouldn't teach you about mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wouldn't do much about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would say, well, go buy this product
and spray it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all that does is make money for that
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then later on in the show,
he would say, also, this podcast is
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsored by the company I told you to buy
the product of earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I felt it was a little shifty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody pays me to tell you to use a
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't use a product because somebody
pays for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a product because it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I like to teach you guys about
why you're getting that problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you've got spider mites,
I try to tell you where they came from,
[SPEAKER_00]: how to fix it, what the problem is,
what to look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't just say, go buy some shit and
spray it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of try to teach you a long-term
prevention.
[SPEAKER_00]: That other podcast was just like,
go buy some shit because I'll get a
[SPEAKER_00]: kickback for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't think that was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But listen to that podcast, Free Weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be some nuggets in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have some grow panels from the high
time cannabis cups that feature great
[SPEAKER_00]: growers and great breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those shows will be the most
informative that will give you the most
[SPEAKER_00]: usable knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than Free Weed, I would recommend
the SPLIF, S-P-L-I-F-F, the SPLIF podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: hosted by Ms. Bo Nellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's taking a little break right now,
which gives you plenty of time to catch up
[SPEAKER_00]: on all of her episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: She will teach you a lot of things that
you may not even think about wanting to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: She opens up my eyes to new ideas on
cannabis and cannabis usage all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't only want to learn about
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to learn about the other end,
about the use, the medical effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to learn about turps,
learn about all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bo will teach you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dude Grows podcast is a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there is a podcast called the Adam
Dunn Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are looking for really long
podcasts, the Adam Dunn Show can be three
[SPEAKER_00]: hours long without any trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally haven't listened to the Adam
Dunn Show in quite a while because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: such a long show and I've got so many
podcasts to listen to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of, I notice if I listen to
too many weed podcasts, it affects my show
[SPEAKER_00]: and it affects my voice and my podcasting
style.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to rip off anybody's
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of put up blinders and ignore
their shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listen to Bo Nellis because we're on a
totally different path of podcast ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: She talks more about the consumption and
that part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I talk more about the production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't feel that her show contaminates
my mind very much, but I feel like Free
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed and the Dude Grows Show and the Adam
Dunn Show can kind of contaminate me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, if I were a comedian,
I wouldn't listen to a lot of other
[SPEAKER_00]: comedians too often because I wouldn't
want to start sounding like them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if I did comedy right now,
I would just sound like Joey Diaz and
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking all those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like music.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just start saying, I don't want to do
that to my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let me get back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck I was saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Adam Dunn Show, I think it's hosted by
Adam Dunn from THC, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the co-host, when I last listened,
was Mitch Shinasa, who has worked with a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of big names in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a very well-respected guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I respect him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate his work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mitch brings a lot to the table for
podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: He writes great pages.
[SPEAKER_00]: He writes great papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: He speaks well.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got great presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: He stays on top of the cannabis industry,
so he's well informed of what's going on
[SPEAKER_00]: in the industry and socially and
culturally within cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's also just a great dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good to have Mitch on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also sometimes Mr. Michael Holly,
also known as Bike, is on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they have some amazing guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being up there in Denver, right in the
heart of Denver, when events come through,
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody goes and stops at the Adam Dunn
Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had Chem Dog on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of my favorite episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dudes from Dark Horse have been on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mila has been on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know anything about Mila Jensen,
DJ Nicotia has been on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tim Martin drops in occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Adam Dunn Show is a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say listen to all these cannabis
podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I would say scour the internet
forums for information, but be very
[SPEAKER_00]: careful what you believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a lot of bullshit on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let the forums spark your mind and then
search whatever you read.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the research and see what you can learn
from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I will see shit in a forum and
I'll say, this is such a cool idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll go, wait, some dude on the
internet wrote this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows who wrote this?
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a nine year old little kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a 50 year old guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be all made up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every time I read something,
I want to go Google what they're saying
[SPEAKER_00]: from seven other directions and see how
this works, why it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it works, what could go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go scour the forums, get some ideas
and then just start reading on your own
[SPEAKER_00]: and figuring it out from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, what can you do before you move?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep doing those consultations.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody else around you is growing,
go check out those grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be around as many grows as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, be around plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to be cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're working with plants,
you're learning about transplanting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're learning about watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell how much water a plant will
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can be in a greenhouse or wherever,
be around plants, working with plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of what we do in a marijuana grow in
a cannabis cultivation facility is basic
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that would happen in other plant
production facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're producing tomato plants or
tulips or whatever, a lot of it is the
[SPEAKER_00]: same shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else you could do, learn about
insects and insect control.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't know enough about
how to take care of insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing you can do, go to the Colorado,
just Google allowable pesticides in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be the Department of Ag is the
website you want to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Department of Ag will have a list.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Colorado Department of Agriculture
will have a list of products you're
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed to use in marijuana enforcement
division regulated grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn those products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about which insects are going to
infest the crops that you plan on working
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are spider mites, thrips,
white flies, fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Powdery mildew is always an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are basically the things you're
going to run into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about all the basic bugs you're
going to get in a grow indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then learn how to combat those pests with
the things that are allowed on that list
[SPEAKER_00]: and get good strategies because not enough
people have strategies for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you come in and you're like,
dude, I know how to take care of these
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs with the products you're allowed to
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: People may like that on your resume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something you could learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you move, your next question is what
to do once we move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you move here, get set up before you
move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Move to an area with an abundance of
facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to be a grower, find an area
with a lot of grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Move to that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver has a ton of grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo has a ton of grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado Springs has a ton of grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all the three major cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fort Collins, not so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boulder, not so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have some, but not as many.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those other three major cities,
they have a lot of grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get to one of those cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apply and be aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have an impressive resume prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look professional on your resume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is a weed job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to be a grower, but still,
we need responsible people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need people with a good resume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing I want to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may sound like a no-brainer,
but I've seen people post things on social
[SPEAKER_00]: media that let me know that I need to
correct this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not go to a job interview with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you show up to a marijuana enforcement
division regulated facility with your own
[SPEAKER_00]: personal product, you are breaking
marijuana enforcement division rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are breaking laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are putting that facility at risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot bring product, your own
personal product, into a facility that is
[SPEAKER_00]: highly illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, as the lead cultivator of a
facility, if I'm hiring you as a grow tech
[SPEAKER_00]: to be my backup guy, I don't want to see
the product de-grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not going to matter too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got that part under control.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want is somebody that can show up
on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody with a solid work ethic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody that is willing to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing, if you know too much about
growing and you're trying to work at the
[SPEAKER_00]: facility that I run, chances are I may not
hire you because I'm concerned that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to come in and try to reinvent my
wheel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a very good system at Three
Rivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Myself and a couple other people have
devised a really good system from clone to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of money invested in the
rooms and the systems and the procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't change that because the new guy
thinks he knows how to grow weed better
[SPEAKER_00]: than me and all the people that have been
there and designed the whole pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need people that are moldable,
people that are willing to learn,
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are willing to listen,
people that are willing to take command
[SPEAKER_00]: from somebody who may be younger than
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that to be a problem in some
facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a boss who was younger than me and
he had a hard time telling me what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be like, bro, you're the boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me what needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people don't like taking orders
essentially from someone younger than
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be receptive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be open and be willing to start as a
trimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be a lead grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90% of the people that start off in the
Colorado marijuana industry start off as
[SPEAKER_00]: either a bud tender or a trimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your way in the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show us that you can be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got stacks of applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: On my desk in the office, there's a stack
of applications taller than my water
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just go through them and I throw half of
them away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope, not qualified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope, they wrote something stupid in their
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show me that you can be on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show us that you can be a hard worker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show us that you can listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show us that you're trainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show that you've got initiative and that's
how you move up in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get here, apply, be aggressive,
have a good resume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you have any special skills,
like if you understand pesticides,
[SPEAKER_00]: put that on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can take any basic horticulture
classes, put that on your resume.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person asks, is there any online
certificate programs that may benefit my
[SPEAKER_00]: cause?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that I'm aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a bud tending school here in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think most employers care too much
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to understand a system called
metric, M-E-T-R-C.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember what it means,
marijuana, something, something,
[SPEAKER_00]: tracking, something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to learn that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be able to use computers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put on your resume that you understand how
to use computers.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that stuff will come into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need organized people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've heard me talk about this on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I cut clones, I have to get a sheet
that is a clone created sheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I cut clones, I write down ... Let's
say I cut five Durban poison clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I write down Durban poison, five clones
from mother plant number 5942.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just making up numbers, which shows
that I took those clones from plant number
[SPEAKER_00]: 5942.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I've got to write that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when those clones go into dirt,
I've got to write down on another sheet,
[SPEAKER_00]: five Durban poison clones into pots from
mother plant 5942 on August 13th.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to write all that shit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be an organized person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that in your resume.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're organized, try to be an
organized person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get here, just apply and be
aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't drop off your application and
forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drop off your application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask for the person that does the hiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, can I speak to a manager?
[SPEAKER_00]: That always helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: The manager walks out and sees your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have your badge attached to your shirt so
that your name is right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we see your face with your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got a resume in our hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We say, hey, you didn't sign your email.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we use it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just say, hey, my new friend from
Georgia that says that on your
[SPEAKER_00]: application, says it on your badge,
and I see your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got three things to connect you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know all this information goes to
this name, this face, and this body.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask for the manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: The manager will come out or the manager
doesn't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it to a budtender.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, be polite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drop off your resume and or application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Call.
[SPEAKER_00]: Call back and bother them and see if
they've seen your application or resume or
[SPEAKER_00]: drop in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in there and chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go in, here's advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go in to check on your
application, don't shop also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it a separate visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in there and buy product or go in there
and check on your application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do both because then it looks like
you just dropped in to buy weed and you
[SPEAKER_00]: thought while you're here you would check.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do those on separate trips.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so go in there and be
aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Call back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know you want the job because
we've got so many applications that you
[SPEAKER_00]: might want to remind us that yours is in
the pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just call back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bother them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know just like any other job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be aggressive and get the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of skill set are employers
looking for in new hires?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I touched on this for a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the can be on time, someone that
is honest, someone that can take
[SPEAKER_00]: direction, someone that is willing to grow
with the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis industry is in its infancy
right now, and we are growing rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that are here right now are
pioneers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you stick around, you'll be something
huge in the industry if you are inclined
[SPEAKER_00]: to move up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get in now or in the next couple of
years, you will be a leader in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are so inclined.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking for hard workers who are
dedicated and who want to learn and who
[SPEAKER_00]: want to grow with the company and be part
of the team for years to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we need people that are willing
to follow rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, we've got millions of dollars in
licensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't fuck around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't lose licensing just because
people want to play games.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the most important things.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I want to thank you for that
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't sign your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have your name at the top of the
email, but I'm not sure if you want me to
[SPEAKER_00]: say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He ends the email with thank you for all
you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the long email that helped
me get a lot of great material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they end the message with PS,
I'm a big fan of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go hug your mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom's not around right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next time I see her, I'll give her a big
hug for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I'm going to take a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's move into the next email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is from a person who calls
themselves Silver Gooch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not sure if I want to kind of curious what
Silver Gooch means.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of don't want to know what Silver
Gooch means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's read this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, I found the
podcast a few months ago and have been
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to the episodes constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your podcast is one of the best I found so
far with the ton of simple to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge for both hobbyists and
professional growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the amazing work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, that's exactly what I'm aiming for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to give you easy to understand,
easy to comprehend information for new
[SPEAKER_00]: growers and professional growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad I'm hitting the nail right on
the head there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the huge compliment to start
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always a good start.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on to say, I'm a recent college
graduate living in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also you guys down south, I hope
you're okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're able to listen to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm fucking up by putting out this
episode right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're not going to get to listen to
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys are okay down there in
Florida and Georgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he goes on to say with a degree,
he's a graduate living in Florida with a
[SPEAKER_00]: degree in counting and have been a
greenhouse manager for a hydroponic farm
[SPEAKER_00]: for nearly three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been meticulously watching any and
all attempts at legalizing both medical as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as recreational cannabis in our
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I'm not optimistic the way things
have been going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it doesn't look well for Florida
right now, but eventually every state will
[SPEAKER_00]: be legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on to say after losing my father a
few months ago to cancer, let me stop and
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly say I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Losing anybody sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: A father has to be the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watching somebody go to cancer must be
miserable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do send some love to you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on to say, it's completely changed
my outlook on the way that cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: handled today in our society.
[SPEAKER_00]: After everything that has happened,
it has only strengthened my resolve to
[SPEAKER_00]: become a breeder in order to help others
get the specialized medicine that they so
[SPEAKER_00]: desperately need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's terrible that it took something
like that to make you change your outlook,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm glad you're on team cannabis now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm proud of you for wanting to be a
breeder for such a good reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people breeding for the
wrong reasons and for selfish and personal
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's good to see more people growing
from their heart, breeding with love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're not there yet, you've got
the right thing in your heart and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what we all need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going the right direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, with that being said,
my question is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you recommend getting into the
industry in new emerging states or
[SPEAKER_00]: established ones, especially with former
agriculture and secondary education?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in the last email I read, I talked
about getting a badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not able to get a badge,
you can still be, I think you can still be
[SPEAKER_00]: the accountant because you would be an
outside contractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would not actually work for the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would be Silver Gooch personal
accounting or Silver Gooch business
[SPEAKER_00]: accounting, whatever you called it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you would be hired.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would just be a service.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be like going to Walmart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walmart doesn't need a badge and I can go
there and buy supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I'm not certain that that's how
it works, but that may be the loophole
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps if you're not able to get a badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anything about you,
but I'm just saying since you've got that
[SPEAKER_00]: college experience there, that may be
another way in for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your question is how do you get in?
[SPEAKER_00]: The same way that I recommended in the
other email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the steps, see if you can get a
badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then move to an area that's got grows in
your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then apply heavily and then go and make
sure those people have seen your
[SPEAKER_00]: application.
[SPEAKER_00]: With all of that greenhouse experience,
I'm sure you've applied pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you know how to water plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably know how to take clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you put that on your resume and
list everything you've ever done,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially stuff like if you're a
pesticide application certified in your
[SPEAKER_00]: state, write that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got any certifications,
any trainings, even if it's like an OSHA
[SPEAKER_00]: training, everybody in micro is worker
protection safety training, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide training that looks really good
on a resume.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how to program a Govita master
controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just one sentence that adds to my
resume.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am well versed in the iPonyx,
the Link 4 system controllers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks good on a resume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any of the equipment or training programs
that you have taken, make sure you include
[SPEAKER_00]: that on your resume and that will help you
get into the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on to say, more importantly,
is it unreasonable to set my sights on
[SPEAKER_00]: becoming a grower slash head grower slash
breeder and living on that pay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any knowledge or contacts would be greatly
appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you can live decently being a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should not reveal what we pay at Three
Rivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just doesn't seem appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the growers do make a livable wage.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend, one of my coworkers,
all of my coworkers are my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my friends, he's got a decent
truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lives on his own.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got his own place and he does all
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He eats well.
[SPEAKER_00]: He smokes heavily and he lives off of
being a grotech wage, which is the,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he goes trimmer and then grotech.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in our facility, it's trimmer,
grotech and then there's like a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: management positions after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's just in the second position and
he's doing all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the head grower and I obviously do
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a decent car.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a pretty big house.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can live off of those wages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how lavish of a lifestyle
you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not be rolling in the Mercedes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not hitting the strip club every
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not popping bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you live a modest life,
you can live off of a grower, head grower
[SPEAKER_00]: salary, very comfortably, very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: A breeder, unless you are an established
grower, an established breeder with a
[SPEAKER_00]: reputation, there's not a lot of need for
a breeder in a commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody is making seeds right now other
than a couple of specialized facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically the owner is the
breeder and that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a well-known breeder in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am, I read genetics is my breeding
company, my seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's available at the dankteam.com if
you're interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't make any seeds in a commercial
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just doesn't make sense right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually there are talks at Three Rivers
and I will build a breeding facility
[SPEAKER_00]: together and I will breed seeds in there
and those will be available exclusively at
[SPEAKER_00]: Three Rivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, that's just in talks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't look to make too much money being
a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being a breeder would be something that
you would do more in your personal grow
[SPEAKER_00]: and your private time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you would grow those seeds out
and then you would want to get those.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to make any money being a
breeder, you've got to get those seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: out, get them known.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a long time to get established.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then honestly, right now, everybody is
a breeder and people either want to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: from Rare Dankness, DNA Genetics,
all those guys that are winning,
[SPEAKER_00]: Swamp Boys, stuff like that, or they want
free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to be a breeder and make any
money off of it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do okay with the IRE genetics line,
but I'm not rolling in money for my
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding projects at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your best bet is to start as a trimmer,
work your way up as a grow assistant,
[SPEAKER_00]: become a grow tech, then prove yourself as
a lead grower, which sounds like you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got the potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got three years in a greenhouse,
you've got a lot more experience than a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you can get a badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get out to Colorado, apply it as many
places as humanly possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do whatever you have to do to apply at
places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get interviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get interviews just like you do with
any other job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bug the management, you go there,
you do what you need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You call, you call, you call.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend you don't shop and check on
your application at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you do get an interview, dress sharp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's the weed industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we need clean people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a clean facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I do have dreadlocks, but I keep
them clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wear clean clothes to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't look like a bunch of bums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't go to my interview looking like a
bum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look decent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't look like a NorCal Humboldt trimmer
wook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look like a presentable person.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a real business with a million
dollar license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show up, dress for success, be there to
win with the rest of us, and we'll hire
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come to the interview looking like a
champ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be ready to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't act like you're the best grower on
the planet because everybody says they're
[SPEAKER_00]: the best grower on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to hire you to trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we hire you, you're going to start off
as a trimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say, I can trim real slow or I can trim
real fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe now's the time for you to start
trimming other people's crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got friends that need help,
go trim that weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if they're not going to pay you,
it may pay off in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I've got two applicants that are both
applying to be trimmers and you've trimmed
[SPEAKER_00]: five plants and the other person has
trimmed zero, you've already got an
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage because I don't have to teach
you from ground zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can say, let's see how you do this and
we'll adjust your trim to our trim and
[SPEAKER_00]: then we'll get you up to speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We expect for trimmers, once they're there
for three, four, maybe five weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need at least a pound a day per trimmer
out of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a guy that can do two and a half
pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a guy at another facility we're
associated with that does nearly four
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the tightest trim in the world,
but he does a trim of nearly four pounds a
[SPEAKER_00]: day, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been hanging up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been de-leafed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're trimming them and that's what
counts is that day when you open up that
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket with the whole plant, then you
start going.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys are pulling.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, and four pounds per person per
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't lie on your application.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can drive a forklift, a scissor
lift, any type of stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you've got any electrical or HVAC
training, all of that type of stuff is
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, list all of that on your resume,
all of that on your application.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that stuff will help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any computer skills, any sort of technical
or mechanical training you've got,
[SPEAKER_00]: plumbing, all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use a lot of plumbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a plumber that's there frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got an electrician there frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our HVAC guy is there frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got any of those skills,
that's useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever used a CO2 machine and know
how to run CO2 and set CO2 alarms,
[SPEAKER_00]: list that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got rescue skills, list that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know how to wear a respirator,
if you've got a respirator fit test and a
[SPEAKER_00]: respirator training from OSHA,
and if you've passed the physical to wear
[SPEAKER_00]: a respirator, list all that because that
saves us money.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to pay 150 bucks to get you
respirator certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you, yeah, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: List all of that sort of stuff on your
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything you can think of that makes you
more sellable to an employee still works
[SPEAKER_00]: in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So list all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I think I covered most of the
basics on how to get a job in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like any other job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, you need to get your marijuana
enforcement division badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your first step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you can do that before you even
start thinking about coming to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you can get your badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you come here and you can't get your
badge, you're fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't work in the industry and you got
to figure out what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your family's here, you're here and you
ain't got shit going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people that did that and
it makes us kind of look bad to tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you can get your badge,
then apply your ass off and then go get a
[SPEAKER_00]: job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to start as a trimmer
or a budtender.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to start at the bottom and
work your way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: People move up quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: People jump from facility to facility in
this industry a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of weirdness and it's a new
industry and people are stoners and people
[SPEAKER_00]: don't take it seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people get jobs and they're like,
cool, I'm the new grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they fuck it off because they
don't take it seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: We fire them and then we move up a trimmer
to a grotech.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my job, honestly, because the
manager that was in my facility was
[SPEAKER_00]: removed from the management position and I
was the next in line that was most
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced and had leadership skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed leadership skills from day one
and when our old manager left,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like, hey, people turned to me and
they said, hey, boss man, what do we do
[SPEAKER_00]: when the manager didn't show up for work
the next day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody turned to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start off at the bottom just like I did
and you can move to the top just like I
[SPEAKER_00]: did, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's wrap up this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one more short paragraph.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says again, thank you for taking the
time to read this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your podcast has taught me a lot about not
only cannabis as a plant, but also how
[SPEAKER_00]: much we can help each other with just a
little bit of kindness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what a great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry that you had to lose your pops
to cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's got to be miserable, but I'm glad
you're on team cannabis and I'm glad
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing what you can to help other
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you guys come to Colorado,
both of you, I hope I get another email
[SPEAKER_00]: saying that you're around so that we can
take some dads together or we can smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you guys may not have dads as much
as we do here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, fuck you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can take some dads, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, I'll roll a fat joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get stoned and hang out and talk
about podcasting and talk about getting
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys jobs in the Colorado cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I really like the part about where
you say, my podcast has taught you not
[SPEAKER_00]: only about cannabis, but how much we can
help each other with just a little bit of
kindness.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is fucking awesome to hear that
people are catching onto that and picking
[SPEAKER_00]: that up just from my little podcast about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of subliminal messages never
hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care of one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be kind to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have each other's back, especially you
folks down south, especially you folks in
[SPEAKER_00]: Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is going fucking haywire right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's on fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's under water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I certainly hope everybody is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, whatever you believe in,
whoever you follow, whatever you love,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're into Jesus, if you're into
Buddha, if you're into Rastafari,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it is, I'm not picking on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mickey, you do your thing, but please,
send some love to the people that need it
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The world is going fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of people in turmoil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send some love and light out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I don't care who you pray to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you do it and as long as you
mean it, send some positivity out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you're praying for good shit,
as long as you're not trying to do
[SPEAKER_00]: terrible shit, I'm cool with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care what you call your God.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care what color your skin is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just send some love to the people that
need it in the shitty times right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, this email wraps up by saying,
stay wide-eyed, smiley, and live life
[SPEAKER_00]: ivory, growers love.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I will stay smiley and always
ivory forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna thank you guys for those emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the great content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for helping me get people into the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's where I'm gonna kinda sound
like a dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado's getting full, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you people that are thinking about
moving here, the traffic is getting
[SPEAKER_00]: horrendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rent is getting high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is getting fucking crowded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is getting more expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love for you to come here and
participate and join us in legal cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and the beauty that these mountains have
to offer and all of the fucking seasons
[SPEAKER_00]: you get to see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from California.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had spring and summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado, we get every season
highlighted really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a huge winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get all the seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come enjoy them if that's what you wanna
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would recommend that you work on
legalization where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't come here, do what you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to legalize where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: My hope is that eventually every state
will be a cannabis legal state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully one day, there won't be
legalized states.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll just be legalized cannabis in the
United States of America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Statewide, you'll be able to travel from
California to New York with your bong in
[SPEAKER_00]: the car, with your weed in the car,
and nobody will give a fuck unless you're
[SPEAKER_00]: hitting it, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not cool, but you can have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have it in the car, and that's
what matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to be able to drive from here to
California with my hash and my rig in a
[SPEAKER_00]: container that is locked and sealed so
that I'm not consuming on the road and
[SPEAKER_00]: have it safe and not have to worry about
going to jail just because I'm carrying my
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine with me to keep my head right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to say don't come.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying if you can't, do what you
can to get it legal where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if everybody keeps coming here,
we're gonna have a bunch of states that
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone that wants cannabis is just going
to the places where it's legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta fight for your own place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you need to fight for your own
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stick around, get it going there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wanna come here, come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking rad here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're having fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you could also stay where you are,
fight for your own place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you're on Team Green,
as long as you're fighting for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care where you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just legalize it everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it here, do it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be on the same team as me,
and I'm cool with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not picky about how or where you do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be a dickhead about it, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't be a black eye or an eyesore on
our community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of try to be responsible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be an adult about cannabis wherever you do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I am fucking rambly.

give your mama a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be sitting in the morning,
I'll be sitting in the evening,
[SPEAKER_01]: watching the ships roll in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I watch them roll away again,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sitting on the dock of the bay,
watching the tide roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just sitting on the dock of the bay,
wasting time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I left my home in Georgia, headed for the
Crystal Bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I've had nothing to live for,
it look like nothing's going to come my
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just going to sit on the dock of
the bay, watching the tide roll away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sitting on the dock of the bay,
wasting time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything still remains the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't do what ten people tell me to do,
so I guess I'll remain the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sitting here resting my bones,
and this loneliness won't leave me alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, 2,000 miles I roam, just to make
this dock my home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm just going to sit at the dock of
the bay, watching the tide roll away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, I'm sitting on the dock of the bay,
wasting time.
I'm sitting on the dock of the bay,
watching the tide roll away.
