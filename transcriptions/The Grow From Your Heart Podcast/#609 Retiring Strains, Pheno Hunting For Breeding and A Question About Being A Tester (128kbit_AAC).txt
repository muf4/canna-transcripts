[SPEAKER_01]: Where do we go from that part of the show?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a lot of great emails I don't
know if I need to waste too much time
[SPEAKER_01]: rambling about a bunch of stuff today
Let's jump right into these grow questions
[SPEAKER_01]: here I feel like I covered the notes in
the business part of the show I have got a
[SPEAKER_01]: question that came from patreon this one
comes from our friend Papa Z It says what
[SPEAKER_01]: up rasta Jeff Papa Z here Several weeks
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sent an email for a seed tester
application as did a lot of people I did
[SPEAKER_01]: an episode asking for people who wanted to
be testers of my seeds and my new
[SPEAKER_01]: creations of my genetics I got a lot of
tester applications this says I never
[SPEAKER_01]: heard anything back But my question is
this before I even get to the question I
[SPEAKER_01]: got an overwhelming amount of tester
applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still finding them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still going through them They are now
moved to a folder that says tester
[SPEAKER_01]: applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've sent out quite a few Tester seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still going through them if you
haven't gotten testers if you haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: gotten a response Don't take it
personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't take it as a rejection.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always going to be making new things
I'm always going to need testers at
[SPEAKER_01]: different levels for different projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't be shy Don't feel like you've
gotten turned down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You still may get selected out of that
tester pool We're always hiring is kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: the attitude here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, let me jump into the question It
says what could I do to what could I do
[SPEAKER_01]: differently to make me a better candidate
for you to choose me?
[SPEAKER_01]: To test for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe in always growing with the
intent of each run being better than the
[SPEAKER_01]: last So I would like to know what areas
I'm lacking in is I want to be the best
[SPEAKER_01]: grower possible And I love your gear much
love and once again Thanks for everything
[SPEAKER_01]: you do for all of us growers trying to
become better I can't say anything
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically that you can do to be a
better candidate as a tester I need all
[SPEAKER_01]: different kinds of testers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need I need testers of all skill levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need some people that are Better as
photographers than growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need some people that are real
analytical and send me over detailed
[SPEAKER_01]: reports on what they fed them Some people
just send me a picture every week and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's basically what I get Some people
send me a report on what they fed it what
[SPEAKER_01]: they did to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a lot of varying reports I expect a
few different things, but I know that
[SPEAKER_01]: humans are going to do things their way So
by giving my seeds out to a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: people who do things their way I get a lot
of great feedback people find their niche
[SPEAKER_01]: their way their spot how to be a tester
for me and they just do what they Do the
[SPEAKER_01]: best so to be a good tester.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say do what you do the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need someone that can communicate That's
one of the things I really look forward to
[SPEAKER_01]: I send out a lot of seeds and I've said it
before about three out of every ten back
[SPEAKER_01]: packs of tester seeds I send the testers
just lose communication eventually,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe they get the seeds They don't even
reply once they've got them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they say hey Thanks for the seeds
and that's all I get from them or they
[SPEAKER_01]: send me a couple of weeks of reports and
then they fade off but my point is
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I send out testers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even get communication so be able
to communicate with me take some photos
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's basically what I asked for for my
testers for you specifically I don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that I could tell you to make you
a better tester However, I did respond to
[SPEAKER_01]: you and I did let you know that being a
patreon contributor Shows me that you've
[SPEAKER_01]: been around for a while Having longevity
having been around the group definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: helps you out There may be a little bit of
favoritism being played and that sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing But if I've seen your name a lot,
I've seen your photos I know your
[SPEAKER_01]: long-term iry army that does Help but new
people are welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't think I'm just sticking to the old
folks I find some great testers and these
[SPEAKER_01]: new random friends were making however I
don't have any specific advice for you,
[SPEAKER_01]: but do message me back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did send you a message on patreon We'll
talk more about getting you some test
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds since you have been a long time
Patreon supporter again you guys if I have
[SPEAKER_01]: not read your Tester application if I
haven't not agreed to send you seeds still
[SPEAKER_01]: don't be discouraged Don't be shy Listen
to that tester episode if you haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: listened to it and you're still interested
in being a tester still keep sending The
[SPEAKER_01]: tester apps I will get to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going through looking at pictures
choosing what I need for now I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: always need the exact same thing Like I
said, sometimes I need the guys with the
[SPEAKER_01]: super detailed and gals with the super
detailed Dirt notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a lot of notes from one person about
what's in their soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're running organic living soil I get
to know everything about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't gotten any details on the
plants, but I know what's in the dirt
[SPEAKER_01]: every week Some people tell me every micro
mole of light that is happening to the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants I get just a lot of varying
Different things and that gives me a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of data So every scientist is going to do
their own experiment They kind of still
[SPEAKER_01]: falls in my guidelines my expectations and
it works out for me very well So be the
[SPEAKER_01]: best grower you could be be able to have
repeatable processes That's the sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff I look for if you're not just doing
crazy random experiments with every batch
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to see some sort of continuity
some sort of process a standard operating
[SPEAKER_01]: procedure would be ideal And the ability
to communicate and speak well and talk to
[SPEAKER_01]: me well is great so you seem to have Those
skills so we will be in touch big shout
[SPEAKER_01]: out to my friend Papa Z You guys don't
feel like you're getting blown off if I
[SPEAKER_01]: have not answered your tester Application
email there were a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a lot of emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only one of me Please do remember
there are a lot of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got close to 6,000 subscribers here
on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got 53,000 followers on cannabis 30
something thousand on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I stay busy plus the seed companies and
everybody else I interact with I have a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not making Excuses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't ever stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I work best when I've got some
pressure on me No diamonds no pressure no
[SPEAKER_01]: diamonds is that what they say if I have
time to chill I fucking chill it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's no good alright.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna get refocused We're gonna keep
reading messages here on the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: because this is a great a message this one
comes from our friend Alabama man.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_01]: I see your name on the patreon quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the continued patreon
support I sure do appreciate it big love
[SPEAKER_01]: big respect big fist bump.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get right into this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says Here's a couple of questions for
future shows concerning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read genetics Just in case you don't
know some people may not even be aware Not
[SPEAKER_01]: only am I a podcaster here to help you
learn how to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also a seed breeder I'm the sole
proprietor sole breeder for I read
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make seeds regular feminized seeds We're
well known for the arise Lemon Jeffrey
[SPEAKER_01]: orangegasm a lot of great stuff comes from
I say our it's me But say our you say our
[SPEAKER_01]: does make a company sound professional,
and it's ours.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of people out there They do
help me behind the scenes and stuff shout
[SPEAKER_01]: out to the packaging crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know who they are but I read genetics
premium seeds is all me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the breeder sole proprietor founder I
am I read genetics premium seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's me check us out at I read genetics
calm now We can talk about what this
[SPEAKER_01]: person is more asking about they say
concerning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read genetics They're gonna focus on my
seed brand here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says what factors influence a decision
to retire a strain So you'll notice that
[SPEAKER_01]: on some of the vending websites some on
some spots on my website it says That this
[SPEAKER_01]: train strain has been discontinued or
retired What influences my decision to
[SPEAKER_01]: discontinue or retire a strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of things that go into
that um a lot of it is Honestly does it
[SPEAKER_01]: sell sometimes I will make a strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be hot fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll think it's gonna sell like crazy I'll
have thousands of seeds of it I'll market
[SPEAKER_01]: it the way that I normally do advertise
the way I do do my strategy Give it out to
[SPEAKER_01]: a bunch of great growers that take great
photos spread it around the world go to
[SPEAKER_01]: sell it And there's no steam that strain
just doesn't go anywhere So I've got bags
[SPEAKER_01]: of that seed sitting around when it comes
time to make more seeds guess what I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: make more of that shit It's just a lot of
it is what sells unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it's a business.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a seed company So that's what drives
a lot of decisions is business what sells
[SPEAKER_01]: Something is not selling and I've got bags
of it sitting around It's I'm not gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: make any more of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no need so that's the bottom line
honestly Well, we talked about grow from
[SPEAKER_01]: your heart and everything But as a seed
breeder, I breed with love grow from my
[SPEAKER_01]: heart But when it comes to keeping
inventory and deciding what to remake the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom line is what sells and what seeds
are gonna sit there I don't want to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of useless seeds that nobody wants
so Bottom line is what sells another thing
[SPEAKER_01]: is the mother plant makes a big decision
Let's talk about a strain a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have recently retired or discontinued
Let's talk about the Rocksteady Rocksteady
[SPEAKER_01]: was part of the TMNT line Rocksteady came
from the Durbin poison female also,
[SPEAKER_01]: what came from that the the dragon punch
came from the The Durbin poison female
[SPEAKER_01]: plant both of those strains have been
retired Because that mother plant was a
[SPEAKER_01]: pain in the ass to keep in the garden that
Durbin poison plant Did not she just
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't fit the program the other plants
liked a certain light cycle a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding regimen a certain VPD and That
Durbin poison plant did not want to
[SPEAKER_01]: participate that little bitch wanted its
own VPD its own feeding regimen its own
[SPEAKER_01]: details and I can't have a prima donna in
my garden like that if I'm trying to run a
[SPEAKER_01]: schedule and a Just the way I'm trying to
do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't work So that led to all of the
subsequent breeding projects from that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant being abandoned and discontinued So
the Rocksteady is gone The double dragon
[SPEAKER_01]: is gone and that's because I did not like
working with that mother plant Another
[SPEAKER_01]: thing that determines on if I keep it in
the breeding stable or not is how many
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds does it make?
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of plants give me a generous amount
of Seeds the Mac sucks at giving me seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: if I put and this these are just
hypothetical numbers I'm gonna make up
[SPEAKER_01]: some numbers here if I put a Strawberry
starburst plant right here and a Mac one
[SPEAKER_01]: plant right here And I pollinate them both
equally with a King Solomon plant if this
[SPEAKER_01]: strawberry starburst plant were to make a
thousand seeds I'm just making up a number
[SPEAKER_01]: this Mac one plant may give me five maybe
20 seeds if I'm absolutely lucky Excuse me
[SPEAKER_01]: for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried to pollinate the Mac at
different times I've tried to pollinate
[SPEAKER_01]: the Mac at different intervals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried different tricks to pollinate
the Mac plant and it's just stingy It
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't want to give me enough seeds to
make it worth my production time So when
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm breeding I just put one little small
plant of the Mac of the room in the room
[SPEAKER_01]: and let it get Hit with pollen if it makes
seeds it does and I'm excited and if not
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we fucking expected and we
just smoked the Mac buds the way they are
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of it is how many seeds does a
plant produce?
[SPEAKER_01]: Also does the mother plant just basically
fit in the program I talked about that
[SPEAKER_01]: Durban poison if it Doesn't fit the
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a certain way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I run my grow a certain schedule a certain
style It's like I'm just gonna pick a
[SPEAKER_01]: brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a Volkswagen shop And if you bring
in Ferrari parts, they got to go do I
[SPEAKER_01]: they're great parts, but they just don't
fit on my Volkswagen Maybe they do I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: the engineer here, but you guys get what
I'm saying, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so if it doesn't fit the program is
just got to go So it's all about that
[SPEAKER_01]: mother plant may get it tossed out sales
if you guys aren't into it if you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't buying those seeds there's no need
for me to Keep it going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will retire it Production and then a big
thing is the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to I get bored of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I've got a DD you could tell by
watching this podcast I've got a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of the a DD there I get bored of
growing smoking breeding playing working
[SPEAKER_01]: with all the same shit forever and also
Added to that we are limited by the amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of plants we are allowed to have here in
Colorado I can have six because of my
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational rights here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm allowed six extra Because my medical
cannabis rights here in Colorado that
[SPEAKER_01]: limits me to 12 plants in my grow So
imagine trying to breed having 12 plants
[SPEAKER_01]: you select your very favorite keepers and
then you've got a few that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinate I'm only allowed to have so many
so that means that the only the best of
[SPEAKER_01]: the best are able to stick around I've got
to get rid of some stuff and anytime I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to bring in something new that means
that something else has to go So hopefully
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a friend around here with the
grow that's got some empty space and they
[SPEAKER_01]: can run a few things and help me select
stuff Then we run a pack of seeds find the
[SPEAKER_01]: keeper out of that and their legal six
plant grow Then I decide which one of my
[SPEAKER_01]: babies I got a colon get rid of that is a
challenge Cut that bitch down bring the
[SPEAKER_01]: keeper from the other grow add that right
to the numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still still staying at the legal
amounts Everybody's in their legal
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how things have to go So sometimes
it's just all about how many plants were
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed to have also.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about moving forward Once so the
iry army the people who buy iry genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a very nice Occult if you will of
people who if I put out a pack of seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure I can sell this many Then there
are other people who find me through
[SPEAKER_01]: websites and new customers and whatever
you want to call them new clients that
[SPEAKER_01]: develop over time But I've got a nice
little core of people who will buy so many
[SPEAKER_01]: then there's a fringe and then there's the
new customers Once the core has got them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of stop selling It's like a
baseball card once that all the collectors
[SPEAKER_01]: have the baseball cards.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't sell anymore So then it's time
for me to make new baseball cards find the
[SPEAKER_01]: new hit player and that is part of being A
seed company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always making new things finding new
stuff keeping cannabis evolving I like to
[SPEAKER_01]: breed brand new things and then go back
and find that brand new shit and breed
[SPEAKER_01]: that back to some of my Older school stuff
just to revive that and keep new stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: coming as a seed breeder a business person
a cannabis connoisseur a Passionate
[SPEAKER_01]: botanist I guess you might want to call me
I am a person with fucking adult attention
[SPEAKER_01]: disorder or whatever you want to call that
I just have to have new things new
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding projects new plants can't Sit
still I think when I sit still that's said
[SPEAKER_01]: it earlier when I sit still that's when I
get bored I cause problems for not
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily problems, but you know that's
when you end up fucking in a fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: battle on Facebook or something wasting
your time the Idle hands are the devil's
[SPEAKER_01]: playground is what I think I'm trying to
say so I keep myself busy Focused on the
[SPEAKER_01]: business focused on breeding focused on
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how my brain works So that is a big
factor on what decides to retire a strain
[SPEAKER_01]: sales are the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you guys react to it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if I discover that somebody else has
the same strain name as me, I will just
[SPEAKER_01]: stop making that strain I don't want to
compete with anybody I don't want to piss
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody off if that person that man that
woman used that name.
[SPEAKER_01]: They deserve the right to that name I
don't want to step on their toes if I made
[SPEAKER_01]: a faux pas a cannabis mistake a breeder
mistake And I didn't do my due diligence
[SPEAKER_01]: and researching that name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will simply retire my cross just to show
that I Respect the other person they're
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding their selections their names
their game Cannabis in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another reason why she gets
retired sometimes simply because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: name The mother plant has a lot to do with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The female plant the production from that
female plant has a lot to do with it I
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like I'm repeating myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I realize that Feminize crosses
it's a pain in the ass to make a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized crosses Sometimes I realize I
got myself in over my head and I just
[SPEAKER_01]: simply don't want to make that anymore
Because the plant doesn't make enough also
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes and you guys all know what I'm
talking about here sometimes I named
[SPEAKER_01]: strains after a bunch of famous cartoon
characters and they get way more popular
[SPEAKER_01]: than I Anticipated it would ever get and
then I fear that I'm going to get a cease
[SPEAKER_01]: and desist letter and they're going to sue
me That may be why a few strains got
[SPEAKER_01]: retired here You guys probably know which
ones I'm talking about if you followed
[SPEAKER_01]: along but that is why some things get
discontinued and retired There are several
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons a lot of it is just basic business
what sells and what doesn't sometimes the
[SPEAKER_01]: names are used Sometimes I fear that cease
and desist letter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, there is a second part to this
course Question I hope I can cover this
[SPEAKER_01]: one as well as I did the first part it
says concerning pheno hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be good I love pheno hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say what a pheno hunt is pheno hunt
is when you've got a package of seeds a
[SPEAKER_01]: number of seeds a population and you were
growing them to Select the phenotype from
[SPEAKER_01]: that batch of seeds that performs best for
your needs It could be your medical needs
[SPEAKER_01]: your recreational needs your hustling
market needs I don't know if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: selling it smoking it trading it pressing
it but the one that fits your needs your
[SPEAKER_01]: growth Your desires the best you were
trying to find the phenotype out of a
[SPEAKER_01]: package of seeds because when you're
growing from seed There will be variation
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll find different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we call the variants different
phenos different expressions So you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to find the one that works best for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a pheno hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do that by growing them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a clone Finish the plants smoke grow
them smoke them find which one you like
[SPEAKER_01]: the best then you got a clone of each one
kept back You can do it all over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that's a pheno hunt and the quick way
it says when growing out A pack of ten
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds by what week from germination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you made your decision to call a pair
for Breeding so the question is basically
[SPEAKER_01]: if I've got a ten pack of seeds that I
plan to breed with how far into The how
[SPEAKER_01]: far from germination do I select breeders
and do I start removing things from the
[SPEAKER_01]: gene pool?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very good question And it's got
there's no solid answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of variation of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I'll see early on that That
plant right there is really slow and
[SPEAKER_01]: shitty and just doesn't do So the main
part of breeding, I guess let me back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main part of breeding is having a goal
What are you what are you trying to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're trying to make pizza you need
pizza ingredients if you're trying to make
[SPEAKER_01]: What's something if you're trying to make
a fucking pumpkin pie you need vastly
[SPEAKER_01]: different ingredients So if I'm growing a
plant trying to make pizza and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: showing me pumpkin pie traits Why keep it
around that one goes early?
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I'm seeing hints of pizza over here
on these traits, then I'll just Keep those
[SPEAKER_01]: pizza plants because I'm trying to make me
some pizza So that is a big part of it
[SPEAKER_01]: find what my goal is Then just get rid of
the plants that don't reach the goal
[SPEAKER_01]: basically Then we'll look for the mutants
the weirdos the oddities just things that
[SPEAKER_01]: are obviously not what I want Maybe that
one like I said earlier grows too slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's too finicky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it doesn't want enough water Maybe
it's super thirsty and it wants a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of water That plant those plants
will slowly get cold sometimes sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really early really really Early
sometimes it's the middle of the veg phase
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of times I can spot the boys from
the girls because the boys get real tall
[SPEAKER_01]: if I'm not looking for boys Sometimes I'll
just take the liberty to toss that super
[SPEAKER_01]: tall plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also is too tall Probably didn't fit the
fucking breeding program.
[SPEAKER_01]: I start watching the structure of the plan
You can tell that early in veg three four,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe five weeks into veg You can tell
what you're working with by the shape the
[SPEAKER_01]: structure Start giving it some stem rubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what it can handle if it can't handle
my rooms my regimen my way of growing It's
[SPEAKER_01]: got to go so that can happen all the way
through veg sometimes up into flower
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I don't even decide that they've
got to go and tell flower Sometimes you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't see I look for bud set as it start
making big chunky buzz as it makes small
[SPEAKER_01]: spindly buds Does it take a long time to
kick into flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it stretch a whole bunch?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it do the dreaded intersex trait if
it does that it goes immediately I can
[SPEAKER_01]: find an intersex trait a week to a flower
or week nine a flower and we're just gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: chop that bitch down and get rid of it and
not Do it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got all the way up till sometimes we
don't decide that we're gonna call
[SPEAKER_01]: something for a breeding project or make a
final decision Until we actually smoke the
[SPEAKER_01]: finished product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to grow them Finish them dry them
cure them smoke them then make your final
[SPEAKER_01]: decision a lot of times I'll grow in
larger batches of ten I had some
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial facilities going where we could
grow larger numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd grow quite a few you'd narrow it
down to the top Two three, maybe the top
[SPEAKER_01]: five and grow those again because the
first time We just did a sample run didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: do anything fancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just did a phenol hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything got the same treatment Now we
know that that one plant could have used
[SPEAKER_01]: more cow mag that one likes more nitrogen
So we'll run the top three or five again
[SPEAKER_01]: and see which one stands out from that Dry
them cure them smoke them do it all over
[SPEAKER_01]: again So sometimes I can call them early
if they're funky if they're ugly not doing
[SPEAKER_01]: what I want They got to go early Sometimes
middle of edge sometimes early flower
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes late in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just kind of depends A lot of times I
will make it's more more common for me to
[SPEAKER_01]: make decisions on what I really want to
keep Kind of late in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just oh I like the structure of that
little girl right there that plants gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: be a boy I'm gonna put them in a room
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are gonna be beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I can just see it I just get a
hint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just get a vibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a feeling from these plants
Sometimes however, we've got to smoke them
[SPEAKER_01]: and sit in a room and go man number three
tastes really good But number four gives
[SPEAKER_01]: me a really good buzz, but number five
Really produced a lot more so you got
[SPEAKER_01]: things to think about as a commercial
grower So sometimes we don't know until
[SPEAKER_01]: the end then then let me go even a step
further Sometimes we don't know until we
[SPEAKER_01]: have extracted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the purpose of this plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a dabber I like to smoke batters and
concentrates Why not do some extraction
[SPEAKER_01]: and then decide which one makes the best
extracts maybe that flavor and that
[SPEAKER_01]: potency Maybe they switch places once you
run it through the extraction equipment
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe the one that tasted better is now
more potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe the one That was more potent now
tastes better after you run it through the
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe one phenotype Really dumps out the
trichomes and puts out a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrates when you press it squish it
wash it run it Whatever you're gonna do
[SPEAKER_01]: then if that's our goal that will be our
phenotypical selection there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So That I know that's a really open-ended
answer But also let me add even more onto
[SPEAKER_01]: that long-winded open-ended answers
sometimes So you said for a breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: program we are simply selecting plants
That are going to be bred with we're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for the boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a really tight criteria and looking
for boys I've talked about I can eliminate
[SPEAKER_01]: boys quickly if they don't fit my
criteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know more what doesn't fit for boys I
could just be like now that's not gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not gonna work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got our boys in one room now
That's a different conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got our girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: We smoke and finish the girls now We've
got three females that we're considering
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinating with our selected male now
we've got to pollinate and grow them and
[SPEAKER_01]: then see Which of those phenotypes produce
the best offspring?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where we are now with the
jack-the-ripper f2 I pollinated multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: females with one male I've sent it out
that sent out the testers with clear
[SPEAKER_01]: indicators There's numbers two four and
five and possibly number three I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know if number three has been sent out for
testing yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just didn't look like one of the keepers
I did not keep that one for continued
[SPEAKER_01]: generations But we sent out two four and
five for testing and now we will find out
[SPEAKER_01]: if the jack-the-ripper from this male one
male Pollinated multiple females.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll find out which of the females
performs better and we'll put those to
[SPEAKER_01]: market Maybe I'll put both of them out
We'll call it JTR f2 number four and JTR
[SPEAKER_01]: f2 number two and we'll simply market both
of them Maybe we'll do some inbreeding
[SPEAKER_01]: like we talked about on a previous episode
I am going to correct some of those terms
[SPEAKER_01]: we spoke of also But sometimes I don't
make my final selections until I see what
[SPEAKER_01]: the seeds do that come from that So right
now I've got the jack-the-ripper number
[SPEAKER_01]: two And number four female on deck in a
grow space somewhere once we determine
[SPEAKER_01]: which progeny is better I'll call one of
those and I'll keep the one that makes the
[SPEAKER_01]: best offspring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So That has gone really far.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants have been dried cured smoked
then regrown pollinated Tested and they
[SPEAKER_01]: are still in testing once the testing
batches some of the first rounds of the
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberry cookies to jack-the-ripper and
jack-the-ripper f2s are coming down this
[SPEAKER_01]: week and being tested I'm Super excited
for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're coming down and getting smoked
really soon once they get smoked and we
[SPEAKER_01]: decide which one was better Then I can
eliminate the parent of the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like the most So there were
multiple cycles gone through while I kept
[SPEAKER_01]: both of those parents around just to see
which worked best you guys That's why
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds are not super cheap Sometimes it
looks like we're just making two plants
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck but there's a lot of selection going
when it's done properly There's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: care selection preparation into it then
there's time to make the seeds after the
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds are made They got to be separated
sorted sorted package sent out tested
[SPEAKER_01]: thoroughly thoroughly tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Pay for every package.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sent out to test out of my pocket That's
eight bucks worth of shipping every time a
[SPEAKER_01]: package goes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sent out a lot of those They got to be
tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we've got to market them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you got to repackage them up for
sales You got to send them out to the
[SPEAKER_01]: vendors Then you got to make more seeds
because once they're tested people see the
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures from the testers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get hot That's why seeds are not
cheap because there's a lot of work that
[SPEAKER_01]: goes on in the background.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't just get too Plants and make them
fuck and put out seeds if we're doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: correctly There's a lot of forethought a
lot of testing a lot of R&D goes into it
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are we on this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I answered most of this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I call them early sometimes in
veg sometimes in flowers Sometimes you got
[SPEAKER_01]: to smoke them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you got to dab them Sometimes
you got to breed with them see which one
[SPEAKER_01]: works the best then keep the keeper get
rid of the non keeper Sometimes I'll do
[SPEAKER_01]: that with a male also when I was looking
for Solomon I went through a lot of seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: to find salt And I was really picky.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see what I wanted exactly in a
male plant finally I found it and I feel
[SPEAKER_01]: like I made the right selection you guys
because Solomon is a bad mo fro All right,
