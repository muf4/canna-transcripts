[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode number 98 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_01]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist, or if you're someone
[SPEAKER_01]: who's just curious about the current state
of cannabis, this, my friends,
[SPEAKER_01]: is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys sitting across the table from me
once again is my good buddy, White Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing, buddy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing well, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I am great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a little bit dabbed the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a couple of new rigs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been hitting them like a champion.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're working.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hash is working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Working well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to drop that music right out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't mean to go so abruptly with the
music.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tried to be smooth, tried to transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ended up just dropping that shit to
zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks for coming, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you work today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you look like you've been at work
all fucking day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a long day at work, but we're
not going to talk about work for all
[SPEAKER_02]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last time Mike was here, we kind of talked
a little bit about the spot last time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about some other
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to give Mike a big thanks for
getting here because he's a new father.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's got to be kind of rough
pulling you away from the kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for showing up at this kind of late
hour on a Saturday night.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of reasons I'm half awake
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll slap you around if you fall asleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may push the mic right into your face
and make you talk louder because I keep
[SPEAKER_01]: turning shit up and it's not going to go
much higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do we want to start?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a lot of great news articles to
talk about you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I get too far, I want to give a
huge shout out to my new friends at
[SPEAKER_01]: Elevate Glass in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Elevate Glass is on South Tejon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have the exact address in my
hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's 512 South Tejon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on the 500 block of South Tejon.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a dispensary right there,
Altitude Organic Medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's a tattoo shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then right next to that is Elevate the
Glass shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got great glass at affordable
pricing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might have super hot chicks working
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: That might be one of the bonuses of why I
like to go there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't confirm it or die.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike has not gone with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been there twice and both times.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a very lovely lady there,
ready and willing and able to help me with
[SPEAKER_01]: all of my glass needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll definitely be back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a new ... I think I talked about the
... It's a mothership knockoff basically
[SPEAKER_01]: that I got there about a week ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then just last night, I went and picked up
a little Hitman.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a mini with the hammerhead on the
inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to grab it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a yellow logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen a Hitman like this with
the yellow logo before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was super cute, so I picked
it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, it hits like a Mack truck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm super impressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your collection is growing by leaps and
bounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: The new additions are wonderful was the
first word that comes to mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have as many rigs as you might
think because I got rid of a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: through a place to make room for these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I swap them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not with the old and with the new.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not as much of a rig junkie as you
might think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Buy a Master Shake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Master Shake was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sloppy's got that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Sloppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you guys check out Olympian Arts
on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my buddy Sloppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's his glass trading page.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking for a new glass or
artistic glass, functional glass at a
[SPEAKER_01]: great price, my buddy Sloppy is now in the
glass business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you support that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Sloppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody sent me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start off the show with an email
from a friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is kind of not cannabis related.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny because he starts his email.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from my buddy Justin.
[SPEAKER_01]: The email says, this isn't really a show
or a growing question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a matter of personal curiosity.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think of Matus Yahoo?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel like his music is reggae or
not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or not really listen to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just wondering, doing fat dabs from Justin
G.
[SPEAKER_01]: Justin, dude, I want to give you a big
shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You follow me on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: You follow me on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You follow me on almost every Periscope
video that I make.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate your support.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to have a little cult that will
listen to almost everything that I put
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely appreciate you guys that are
my little following there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's freaking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, let's talk about Matus Yahoo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike's ridden around in the car with me
and heard what happens when Matus Yahoo
[SPEAKER_01]: comes up on the shuffle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to join in and get out those riggy
diggy doy diggy doy doys.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to get there and get going with
him, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit is so much fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've learned to meditate while you drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of wedge yourself in there for impact
and then tune out and pretend like it's
[SPEAKER_02]: not reggae all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put yourself in your happy place.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to get reggae'd enough at work,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, they do play some reggae at work.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, let's talk about how I feel about
Matus Yahoo.
[SPEAKER_01]: One day, my buddy Ross Christian,
who is one of the guys that taught me a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot about Rastafari, I shout out to Chris,
much respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ross Chris gave me a little CD with one
Matus Yahoo song on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I came home and listened to it and I was
like, that is the shit right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just really liked the flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: The music was good, but I liked the way it
felt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just flowed really smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: His lyrics were really smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was driving from Pueblo, Colorado to
Lawrence, Kansas on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a band out there and I lived here
and had a band out there and then I'd
[SPEAKER_01]: travel back and forth all the time to take
care of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a CD player in the car and all of my
CDs got stolen, except for the one that
[SPEAKER_01]: was in the CD player.
[SPEAKER_02]: That happened to a bunch of people I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Live at Stubbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the Live at Stubbs album.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I had to drive back and forth
to Lawrence, Kansas.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about a 10, 11 hour drive,
depending on traffic and depending on how
[SPEAKER_01]: things go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 10 or 11 opportunities to listen to
that CD from beginning to end,
[SPEAKER_01]: both ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally fell in love with that album,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shake Off the Dust Rise came a little bit
later in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I got that one right after I got
tired of the lot, right after the theft,
[SPEAKER_01]: right after everything got stolen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to Lawrence, Kansas and showed a
couple of my friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, check this guy out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we saw him at Waka Rusa.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the first night at Waka Rusa Fest in
2005, I believe, there wasn't anybody
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was like 40 of us up front checking
out Montes Yahu.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second night, there had to be 150
people there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The third night, that place was packed,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: He took one night off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a four night festival.
[SPEAKER_01]: He takes a Saturday off for the Sabbath.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the Sunday night when he played,
it was packed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't even get in the tent to see
the man anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over three nights, he just blew up like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to go see Montes Yahu on one of my
birthdays.
[SPEAKER_01]: My girlfriend took me to see him at the
Beaumont Theater in Kansas City,
[SPEAKER_01]: Kansas.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of all random places when I lived in
Lawrence.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to see Montes a few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen him at the bottleneck in
Lawrence.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen him a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That artist meant a lot to me just from
that time period.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really brings me back to that whole
time period of my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Got No Water was my favorite
Montes song.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then unfortunately, when he came out with
the album Youth, I feel like he put all of
[SPEAKER_01]: his life's work into the Shake Off the
Dust Arise album.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of his writing for 20 years of being a
person, he put into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he did Live at Stubbs, which is
basically the same thing just live.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they're like, all right, now you've
got a production deal and a record deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's make an expensive album.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, oh shit, I already put it all
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed like he had already done almost
his new stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like the new stuff as much as I
did the old stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that happens to a lot of artists.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel the same way about Spearhead.
[SPEAKER_01]: The older shit was much better.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something about music that
whatever drives you to create it dies when
[SPEAKER_02]: enough money lands on top of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how I feel about it, especially if
you're an angry band.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where you see it the most.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, all right, you just got a $12
million contract.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you still angry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless they really start buying just more
expensive heroin or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've really gotten off the rails of this
podcast, but where would music be without-
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think Jeff knows a lot about weed,
he knows so much more about music.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do know a lot about music.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could probably do a music podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've played the drums for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can read and write music.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot about music, music playing
and listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also know about bands.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could do a whole show about that
because we've gotten way off topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where would we be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where would music be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where would musicians be if they didn't
alter their minds a little bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Beatles would have never came up with
any of that shit if they didn't start
expanding their minds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Life would be very, very boring if the
musicians didn't smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Grateful Dead would not have been fun
if I was not tripping my face off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's a great Lenny Bruce rant
to that effect, if I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to put the show back on track just
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're almost 10 minutes in and we haven't
talked about weed at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Justin, thanks for the email,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really made me time travel in my mind
when I read that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was really reminiscing on those days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Matas Yahu is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a great message.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a positive dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't use any profanity, so it's good
for the kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: He only talks about good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: To pump your head and heart with good
stuff is always better than listening to
[SPEAKER_01]: some negative shit that makes you want to
do stupid shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't listen to things like Insane Clown
Posse and shit like that because it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't support anything good for your
mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen to some Matas Yahu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen to some Spearhead.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people around here are into Nako.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't get into Nako for some reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nako and medicine for the people,
but a lot of the hippie kids or all the
[SPEAKER_01]: dreadlock kids are loving it now,
so check that out if you need some good
[SPEAKER_01]: positive music in your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get on to something that has
something to do with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to go?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got three topics here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all equally important.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the 30 shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got recreational cannabis is now
legal in the state of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should we start or end with goodness?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our good news.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we've got an article about somebody
getting shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go bad, bad, good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's end on a positive note this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last night it was a down note.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to come up with positive shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then let's start the bad,
bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to go worst first,
let me open up Google here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already got this article saved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happened again this year, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is outdoor season and people that are
growing outdoors are sitting outside
[SPEAKER_01]: waiting for thieves.
[SPEAKER_01]: The past two weekends over the past 14 or
15 days, I have heard of about seven or
[SPEAKER_01]: eight, maybe nine or 10 outdoor grows
getting stolen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that time of year, people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is ripper season.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ripper, homie season.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had a lot of people in my world have
just wrecked winners because of rippers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They spend all summer throwing their life
into a crop and then it vanishes days
[SPEAKER_02]: before it's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wake up, you go out there to water
your plants and guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not there anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw something about a van get busted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say it was in California that
was just packed full of plants that had
[SPEAKER_02]: just been ripped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen a number of posts on Facebook of
security cam footage with people's faces
[SPEAKER_02]: of people ripping plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, if you are in any pot group on
Facebook, somebody has posted a picture of
[SPEAKER_01]: some asshole and it says, this guy stole
my pot plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know who he is?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all over Facebook right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody is getting ripped off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happened in our town.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just get right to the news article
here, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got it on the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The headline is, you need something over
there, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: No?
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a dab?
[SPEAKER_02]: My brain wants cigarette, but no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't do that here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a vape, I'll let you vape in
here, but no?
[SPEAKER_01]: Came unprepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Came unprepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize for your lack of preparation,
son.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe if you take a dab, it'll fucking
settle down your urge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm already stoned to death.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep you slightly coherent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are half asleep on the show already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, we can't make fun of Mike for being
half asleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a new father.
[SPEAKER_01]: He worked a long shift.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went home and ate dinner and then he
came over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like 11 o'clock on a Saturday night
and this dude's here recording with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to bed at 7 a.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got up at 11 and then worked a nine hour
shift.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dedicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're fathering it up and I'm here
recording a podcast at almost midnight on
[SPEAKER_01]: a Saturday.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how cool we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting it done for the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's what we got to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm running out of time to do things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been dedicated to the spot lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting it done.
We're jumping.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're there all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's not talk about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't talk about the spot on this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ixnay on the Otz Bay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just why we're here at midnight,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the truth or the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: The headline says, fuck, where's my brain?
[SPEAKER_01]: The headline says, before I get that far,
this is from Jesse Paul of the Denver
[SPEAKER_01]: Post.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found it on denverpost.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says Pueblo Police.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our town, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pueblo, the city of Pueblo, Colorado,
the 719.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pueblo Police, teen shot after
burglarizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Burglarizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Burglarizing was the word that I couldn't
say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Teen shot after burglarizing illegal
marijuana grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Investigators say Vincent Duran,
the homeowner, shot at the two alleged
[SPEAKER_01]: burglars.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got anything to say, Mike?
[SPEAKER_01]: You looked like you're about to speak up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard about this story the next morning
and yeah, it's a horrible incident.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's going to jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of the kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're being charged with burglary.
[SPEAKER_02]: The homeowner's being charged with first
degree assault.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what happens when you shoot
somebody who's running away from your
[SPEAKER_02]: property.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's read the article here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, a 17 year old boy was shot early
Friday in Pueblo after authorities say he
[SPEAKER_01]: burglarized demands illegal marijuana
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's update the people why it's
illegal before we even go too far because
[SPEAKER_01]: we are in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone is allowed to grow six plants of
their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every adult.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a medical marijuana
recommendation from a doctor, you are able
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow possibly more plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the city of Pueblo, within the city
limits of Pueblo, it is now illegal to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow any sort of cannabis, recreational or
medicinal, outside of your home in your
[SPEAKER_01]: yard that is not in an enclosed building.
[SPEAKER_01]: Greenhouses are illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be like a sealed normal
building, like a structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be like in a building with a
foundation as part of the rule.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be so many square feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are thorough rules that you have to
follow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: No worries that happens with the dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't just plant six plants in your
backyard anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did away with that a year ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Statewide, you just have to have it in a
locked enclosed space.
[SPEAKER_02]: But every city and county and town now
have their own little rules for the most
[SPEAKER_02]: part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we cannot grow outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy was not following them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so his grow was illegal and he's being
charged with nuisance violations,
[SPEAKER_02]: if I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: A thousand dollars a pop per plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's six thousand in city fines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, he's got to destroy the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, he's being charged with first degree
assault for shooting a teenager.
[SPEAKER_01]: Destroy them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just cut them down and take them
inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just about time.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has to destroy them.
[SPEAKER_02]: How, son of a bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they could be a series of small
fires.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's got to cut them down and they
can't be out there anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's harvest time anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's just got to chop them down now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take them inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: But had this garden been discovered by
city inspectors or regulators or if the
[SPEAKER_02]: neighbor called the cops or whatever six
months ago, when they were knee high and
[SPEAKER_02]: there was no bud there, he would have had
to cut them down then too.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just wanted to explain why his grow was
illegal since it is Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: That may be confusing to some folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: The article goes on to say police say the
teen showed up at a hospital at about four
[SPEAKER_01]: fifteen a.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: Friday with a gunshot wound to his right
leg.
[SPEAKER_01]: The juvenile male initially stated he was
shot after leaving a party on the west
[SPEAKER_01]: side of Pueblo, police said in a news
release.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it was later determined that he
had another he and another individual had
[SPEAKER_01]: jumped a fence into a yard on the sixteen
hundred block of Western 13th Street in
[SPEAKER_01]: hopes of finding marijuana plants in an
outdoor grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Investigators say Vincent Duran,
age 55, the homeowner shot at the two
[SPEAKER_01]: alleged burglars, striking the teen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The juvenile was treated, released and
taken to the Pueblo Youth Services Center
[SPEAKER_01]: where he was booked on burglary charges,
police say.
[SPEAKER_01]: God, imagine how that would suck,
do you go to steal some weed and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: just a teenage kid thinking you're going
to go jack some blood.
[SPEAKER_01]: You end up shot in the leg at the hospital
and then in fucking jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no sympathy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't either.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm relieved the homeowner didn't kill
him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm glad he didn't die.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad he just got he was only injured.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Jesus, this article has been all over
Facebook because our friends posted it to
[SPEAKER_01]: Facebook and shared it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people have commented, fucking kid got
what he had coming to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people have commented, I would have
shot him again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, this is Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know this is your investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know this is your business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please don't fucking shoot people over
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be growing it legally anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's legal here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just follow the simple rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if somebody is trying to steal those
plants, call the cops.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they're there for.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why legalization is beautiful,
is we finally get to use law enforcement
[SPEAKER_02]: when somebody tries to steal our weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had a friend recently stolen from
who actually called and reported his
[SPEAKER_01]: plants stolen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cop asked him how much was that
plant going to harvest you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it going to yield?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he told him how much it would yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, what would that cost you to
buy it a dispensary?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he told him what that would cost per
ounce.
[SPEAKER_01]: He called me and got a price quote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told him it'd be this much per ounce,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so on the police report, they value
each plant at what an ounce would cost at
[SPEAKER_01]: my shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now those people that will be caught
because they've got video of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll be charged with felony theft
because they took over a certain amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars worth of product.
[SPEAKER_02]: The real beauty of legalization is that we
can use courts and lawyers and cops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the violence doesn't have to exist
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in your backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're stealing your shit, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let the dog out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you let the dog out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, make them run.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a firearm, point it at them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't fucking shoot them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nine times out of 10, it's teenagers or
dipshit kids and just flip the lights on
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're going to run away.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a 17 year old boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you would have said freeze,
get on the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have called the cops.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have dealt with it a little bit
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: This dude shot a young kid who was running
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was already running away.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was on his way out.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_01]: Duran was arrested on suspicion of first
degree assault and police say he'll also
[SPEAKER_01]: will be issued a summons for the marijuana
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll also be ordered to remove the grow,
police say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Investigators say they are searching for
the teen's accomplice.
[SPEAKER_01]: In August of 2014, a 13 year old boy was
wounded by a man after allegedly trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: steal marijuana plants from a backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see this is going to happen every
year if we keep having these illegal
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just put it inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody can see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're doing it properly, nobody can
smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody knows it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can control it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can grow year round.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just go get a carbon filter and a grow
light and a grow book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Read the book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the sun is free, you guys,
but in the city, in the city of Pueblo,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you grow and it gets something like
this happens, it puts a black eye on our
[SPEAKER_01]: entire industry, our entire community,
on the plant, on the movement,
[SPEAKER_01]: on everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody got shot over some weed because
somebody was growing it outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just for the ballpark, a decent little
grow set up for six plants is going to run
[SPEAKER_02]: your what?
[SPEAKER_02]: The best gear, three grand?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh dude, I can set you up ready to grow
for less than a thousand bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like if you want with the best,
like three or four?
[SPEAKER_01]: 25.
[SPEAKER_01]: 25.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much would you pay to not just sweat
for six months, eight months while your
[SPEAKER_02]: plants are out back?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if someone's going to steal your
effort?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like for me, it's definitely worth more
than a grand or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you think about it this way,
if you're growing enough outside to make
[SPEAKER_01]: it worth shooting somebody for it,
you are doing, you're growing more than
[SPEAKER_01]: you need probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're growing your entire year
supply.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't judge you, but think about the
situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing that much, you might be
asking for something if you're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: get greedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might be inviting trouble if you're
trying to get greedy is what I think I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: This dude's going to end up harvesting
enough weed to get him until he's got to
[SPEAKER_02]: turn himself in to go to jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: He decided to shoot the kid trying to
steal his weed and now he's going to end
[SPEAKER_02]: up in jail for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The kid's going to jail for trying to
steal it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's just shitty all around because
this dude wanted to skirt the law in a
[SPEAKER_02]: place where it's legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's just change the item being
stolen from, excuse me guys, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's change this item from cannabis
plants to a car.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it goes down like this, everybody's
still going to jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But would you have shot at somebody
stealing your car?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a feeling this guy would have.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we had an incident in the city a
couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: It got a whole lot of press because it was
particularly brutal.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy kind of lived in the middle of
nowhere and had a trash pile with a bunch
[SPEAKER_02]: of scrap metal in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people kept pulling up in the middle
of the night and stealing his scrap metal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one night he got his rifle and turned
all the lights off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when the pickup truck showed up and
people climbed out and turned flashlights
[SPEAKER_02]: on, he opened fire and he killed one of
them, wounded another one, held one of
[SPEAKER_02]: them at gunpoint until the cops got there
and was looking at like first degree
[SPEAKER_02]: murder charges because that's first degree
murder.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't lie in wait and kill people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just Pueblo people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is going to happen all over the
country.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just happened in Oregon too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ripper season.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys don't, like that's a big part of
growing marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: It used to be because it was illegal,
but it was always also because marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: is worth a lot of money, especially in
places where it isn't legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can steal it from someone,
your cost is zero and you can take it
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somewhere where you can sell it for six,
8,000 a pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people are going to try to steal it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the people that are going to try to
steal it are shitheads.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these guys are professionals.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was told a story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was told a story of somebody who got
into a greenhouse with a polyvinyl cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know exactly what that shit's
called, but greenhouse covering,
[SPEAKER_01]: thick covering.
[SPEAKER_01]: They cut a three foot tall slit in the
cover, just a slit three feet tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they took every fucking plant out of
the greenhouse, did not leave a footprint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nor a leaf behind and cleaned the entire
greenhouse out.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys are professionals.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are experienced rippers out there
and they're at work all for the next week
[SPEAKER_01]: or two, just taking crops that are
finished.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you guys get your plants cut down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, if someone comes to steal your
plants, please don't shoot them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go to jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, really think about what you're
going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not go to jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And earlier I said, let your dogs out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let your dogs out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you let your dog out and your dog bites
somebody, you got to put your dog down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that person may shoot your dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just keep the dog in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's a, there's really not a great
option here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's one of the things that sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Call the cops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call the police.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got, yeah, I guess so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or grow indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just had a guy get shot for confronting
some taggers in the alley.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm really kind of anti, you know,
doing anything right now, other than like
[SPEAKER_02]: bring in official.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's what they're there for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just call the cops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't try to be a vigilante.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always hated the not doing it
because I had weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were so many times where it was
like, I should, and I didn't because I had
[SPEAKER_02]: weed or smelled like weed or it just
smoked.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I've had to just call 911 and
say, Hey, there's a car upside down on the
[SPEAKER_01]: interstate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, why don't you stop?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'm high as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, gosh, excuse my throat clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to give it one good one and
I'll be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that was just exaggerating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm good though.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the worst.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the bad news.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's find.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this is some not great news.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not great news.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I am, I was saying that we're not
going to talk about the spot on this
[SPEAKER_01]: episode, but guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: The spot will be used as an example in the
following.
[SPEAKER_01]: The spot, the spot passed all these tests
with flying colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did not get any violations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is legit at the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are champions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that being said, the headline for
this article is seven Denver marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: shops cited for underage sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: The byline is police say they conducted
checks on 30 Denver retail marijuana shops
[SPEAKER_01]: on Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found this article on the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, this article is written by Jesse Paul
of the Denver post.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I actually first heard of this of from
our good friend, Dave Munn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to Dave for putting me on the
case to find this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dave's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your nipples are sticking out,
Dave.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to let you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this article says Denver police issued
seven citations for underage retail
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana sales during an enforcement
operation at 30 shops last week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Officials said on Wednesday, police say
they conducted checks Friday in an effort
[SPEAKER_01]: to audit any potential underage sales and
found there to be lower underage
[SPEAKER_01]: compliance rate to be a lower underage
compliance rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read that wonky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we are disappointed said Louis Koski,
director of Colorado's marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: enforcement division.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a statement up until now, these
compliance checks have been a bright spot
[SPEAKER_01]: for the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: This recent check drops compliance to 92%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we were at 99%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before fuck heads, fuck heads,
making us look bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the news comes as a blow to
recreational marijuana in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially since the, in the roughly 21
minutes months since recreational
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana has been legal stores,
mostly have been lauded for their
[SPEAKER_01]: compliance owners and operators have been
praised for their handling of the hot
[SPEAKER_01]: button topic of underage possession and
consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Colorado, what they're mainly
worried about is this, uh, weed being sold
[SPEAKER_01]: to people who are not 21 and also weed
being sold out the back door of the
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary that isn't being documented.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Underage sales and product and leaving a
shop headed out of state, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: in bulk in bulk is the, or are the two
things that we're really, really,
[SPEAKER_02]: really seeking to avoid here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call those the fatal flaws.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are, these are things that will
trigger federal intervention if they get
[SPEAKER_02]: out of hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I mean, just in my world,
all of the anti-pop people love shit like
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it doesn't matter that we only drop
down percentage wise to in line with
[SPEAKER_02]: alcohol and tobacco retailers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like all three of those businesses,
um, sit at about a 92% compliance rate,
[SPEAKER_02]: like 90 to 92.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're at 92 now, thanks to this,
we were at 99 thanks to Aspen dipshits
[SPEAKER_02]: dipshits.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were two shops in Aspen that were
busted a while ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, after they were busted, pretty much
every shop in the state got a letter
[SPEAKER_02]: saying, Hey, make sure your ID check
system is up to snuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing compliance checks.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not trying to scam you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they're not going to pretend that
they're 21 and show a fake ID or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it'll be an under 21 ID and you'll
fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how you get stung.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the state of Colorado, our IDs are
vertical horizontal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're over 21, it fits one way on the
card.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're under 21, it fits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that should be obvious.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to look at the verticals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I just had a family member turn 21
and her ID is still good for several
[SPEAKER_02]: months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got to read the date,
but how it's not hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know who you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody go get a little flip calendar
with the, you can't buy shit here.
[SPEAKER_02]: If he was born before.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should have somebody upfront who's
trained and experienced in checking IDs,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We have armed security checking every ID
that comes to the store.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we turn away 65 year olds all the time
because their ID expired a week ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how strict our shop is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know you said we weren't going to
talk about the spot, but this is an
[SPEAKER_01]: example of what should be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you got to do it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fire inspector showed up and the fire
inspector said, Hey, I'm here to look in
[SPEAKER_01]: the back of the building.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the security guard said, and who are
you?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, I'm the fire inspector.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the security guard said, sir,
can I see your ID?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, I don't have an ID.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the fire inspector.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the security guard stuck out his hand
and said, I'm John on the security guard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to meet you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I see your ID?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the guy was like, I'm the fire
inspector.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need an ID.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes, I don't know who you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't come in here and sent the fire
inspector away because he didn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: proper identification.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was in a fire truck, but dude didn't
have ID.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can't let him in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's period.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Period.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have ID.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could be Barack fucking Obama.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think we'd let you in there
unless you pull out that ID.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we had cops come to the shop because a
crazy guy said we stole his wallet one day
[SPEAKER_02]: and the security guard checked their IDs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really funny to watch.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the blood tenders were standing
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like dude, he's really checking their IDs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the third one in a row.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's getting, he's getting his wallet out.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's pulling out his driver's license and
giving it to our security guard.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to whichever security guard that
was.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's everyone that comes in, gets IDed.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your ID is expired, you can't come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not 21, you can't come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every shop in the legal industry needs to
be able to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: We make vendors wait in the entry room if
they don't have their ID with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you cannot go back to the offices.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to wait right here in this chair.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll come and then we make them wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they have a delivery for us and they
don't have their ID, we handle everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: else first and we get them.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's get back to this article.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking a little bit about the
spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We said we weren't going to, we're just
praising the rules that were followed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been at it for just over almost two
years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit, time flies.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lot of information in that
last paragraph.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're re-stinging, purposefully
re-stinging businesses that failed to make
[SPEAKER_02]: sure that they're back in compliance where
they need to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another piece of information you might
enjoy, dear listeners, is if you're a
[SPEAKER_02]: tobacco or alcohol retailer, the fines
usually about 10,000 for screwing up an ID
[SPEAKER_02]: check.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a marijuana retailer,
the first two penalties you face are a
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred thousand dollar fine and you can
lose your license.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hundred thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's 10 times the fine if you screw
this up as a marijuana business.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could close a shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could absolutely close a smaller
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could shut it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: A new dispensary, they could be gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ouch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of shops that that would have
closed down in their first year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would have closed down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike and I worked, we met each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We became good friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: That probably would have closed MetaMar.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would have destroyed MetaMar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a hundred thousand dollar fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would have just closed that place
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have been hungry.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to continue with the article
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says when reached by phone,
representatives at five of the shops cited
[SPEAKER_01]: either declined to immediately comment or
said they could not discuss the citations
[SPEAKER_01]: because of ongoing criminal
investigations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously we failed at our mission to keep
people under 21 out of our shops and Ryan
[SPEAKER_01]: Fowler, owner of the cited store,
Red Eye Relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm incredibly disappointed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I must say I like the name Red Eye Relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds like something I would have
said.
[SPEAKER_02]: I drive by two of these shops regularly
when I'm in Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost stopped at one of them the last
time I was up in Denver just a few days
[SPEAKER_02]: ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should have stopped.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would have let you in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Fowler said foreign employees,
including a store manager, were fired in
[SPEAKER_01]: the citations wake.
[SPEAKER_01]: He added the shop will stop accepting
vertical identification cards and begin
[SPEAKER_01]: using electronic verification to ensure
there are no underage customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if you're 21 and you have a
vertical card, they're not going to let
[SPEAKER_01]: you in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is nonsense.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can fully let in people that are 21.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you should.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're perfectly legally allowed to shop
in your business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing with the electronic card
reader.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can't look at the date and see what
it says, the electronic card reader ain't
[SPEAKER_02]: going to help you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shows your age.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, when you slide that card reader,
it shows the actual age.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you can't read a year, can you read
a number at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, there are a few dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you come to Colorado and you shop at a
dispensary, there are a few that run your
[SPEAKER_01]: card through that little card reader like
they have at the bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: That thing does not save any information,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not save any information.
[SPEAKER_01]: It scans your ID and it processes the
information on your ID.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it shows how old you are is all
it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are paranoid that that
thing is showing your ID.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not or that it's keeping your
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not allowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dispensaries are not allowed to track
your information.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that we do keep track of is
oftentimes dispensaries will document what
[SPEAKER_01]: state you were from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is mostly for advertising and
just marketing purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not keeping your information.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to know where you live.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're out of room for records.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to be a dick about it, but we're sort
of busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have time to even process that
information, let alone compile it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A need or anything to do with it either.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get back into this article.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are very concerned about this matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Healing House said in a statement to
the Denver Post, we are 100% committed to
[SPEAKER_01]: compliance in all aspects of the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have had no issues in the past,
and we are taking this matter very
[SPEAKER_01]: seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Officials say the citations for selling
marijuana to a person younger than 21 were
[SPEAKER_01]: issued at seven separate businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: The charge is a class one misdemeanor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they could also face criminal charges,
huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: The person who made the sale has already
been cited with a criminal charge,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they'll be going to court for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we say we're not going to talk
about the spot, but when you walk into
[SPEAKER_01]: most dispensaries, there's a security
guard up front checking IDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he sends you back to the budtender
who sells you bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he rings you up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's responsible there for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: The security guard or the budtender?
Me.
[SPEAKER_02]: The budtender.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be checking an ID again?
[SPEAKER_02]: We totally ask if we're at all worried
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of faith in our security
guards.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't at all tolerate the security
guard not doing his job perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of those guys are military guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole company is ex-military.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone in that company is a vet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're used to doing everything perfect
when they have to at work, and so it's
[SPEAKER_02]: simply done correctly every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We still ask from time to time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a couple of people that come in
the shop that look very, very young,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're both well over 21,
but they don't look it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time there's a new budtender there,
and even sometimes when there's just a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of people there and we want everybody to
be confident that we're not selling to
[SPEAKER_02]: under 21 people, we'll just, hey,
can I see your ID again real quick,
[SPEAKER_02]: man?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got to be sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my butt on the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: True.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're way too pretty for jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I really like you dude,
but you're not worth 100K.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or your job.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: This $40 sale is not worth $100,000 fine
and my job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the criminal charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And us being on the news.
I like my badge.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to continue with the article,
and then I just realized that at the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom of the article, I didn't see this
when I skimmed through this the first
[SPEAKER_01]: time, all of the shops are listed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So avoid them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you're not 21, go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it says those dispensaries need to be
held accountable, said Tyler Henson,
[SPEAKER_01]: president of the Colorado Cannabis Chamber
of Commerce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your job as an owner and operator is to
ensure your employees are readily trained.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can't happen again, he added.
[SPEAKER_01]: Henson said employers and their employees
need to understand what's at stake here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Officials say the violations can mean a
license suspension, a fine per individual
[SPEAKER_01]: violation, a fine in lieu of suspension up
to $100,000 and a license revocation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, that sounds so serious when he put it
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, think about it, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: What did the one shop down here do that
got their license pulled?
[SPEAKER_02]: On-site consumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: On-site consumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't like they were giving out
dabs in the bud room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had roaches in an employee bathroom
and it was enough for them to lose two
[SPEAKER_02]: store licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Underage sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: They haven't closed the shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: That I know of yet, but I don't think any
of the cases that have screwed this up
[SPEAKER_02]: have gone through that process completely
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time will tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's brand new.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: My guess is a couple of people are going
to lose their license.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get stung twice, I would bet on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it says sanctions may also include
restrictions on the license, police said
[SPEAKER_01]: in a news release.
[SPEAKER_01]: Investigators say they will file the cases
with the Denver City Attorney's Office,
[SPEAKER_01]: which could issue its own discipline
ranging from license suspension to license
[SPEAKER_01]: revocation.
[SPEAKER_01]: According to the Colorado Department of
Revenue, the Marijuana Enforcement
[SPEAKER_01]: Division has conducted 172 compliance
checks since January 1st of 2014 and found
[SPEAKER_01]: 16 total violations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it goes on to say Denver marijuana
shops were cited where citations were
[SPEAKER_01]: issued, and then it lists them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says the Herbal Cure on South Logan
Street, the Healing House on South
[SPEAKER_01]: Downing, Pure Medical Dispensary on 40th
Avenue, La Conte's Clone Bar and
[SPEAKER_01]: Dispensary on East 7th.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's over by where they host the
Cannabis Cup, Herbs for You on East 9th,
[SPEAKER_01]: Mile High Green Cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys have a Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: So does La Conte's.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple of places on here that
have Cannabis Cups that are professionals
[SPEAKER_01]: that have a reputation that are fucking
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how the fuck some of these
shops mess this up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red Eye Relief on South Cherokee Street.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we can chalk a couple of them up
to a lazy employee or somebody up at the
[SPEAKER_01]: front not giving a shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just hand them an ID and like they
look.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been not old enough and gotten into
clubs just by handing the bouncer an ID
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was my ID that said I was not 21.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, oh, you got an ID here and
just hands it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because like you said, some people aren't
fucking smart enough to read an ID to
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out that 1970 whatever means you're
this how old, you know, people can't do
[SPEAKER_01]: that math in their head sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can give a couple of those just to
dumb employees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it's just one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: One or two is probably just somebody
letting somebody slip through just needing
[SPEAKER_01]: to make a sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know what it is,
but if you if it if selling to people
[SPEAKER_02]: under 21 is part of your business model,
you can go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, then we're trying to set a positive
standard here and do things correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're literally front and center on the
world stage when other nations bring up
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana legalization as an idea or a
concept that they might want to pursue.
[SPEAKER_02]: They discuss what's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we are the mom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every now and then I hear about someone
from France or London coming through
[SPEAKER_02]: Pueblo and taking a look at what we're
doing here in Pueblo, which this never
[SPEAKER_02]: would have happened five years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no reason for any of these people
to be here and be interested in what we're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing with their coming here to see how
marijuana legalization works in practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they see teenagers waiting in line,
it's not going well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to spread.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it should.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you guys, we've got one more
article that I want to get in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been going for close to 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get this one in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people seem to like when I've got
somebody else with me, they'll listen a
[SPEAKER_01]: little longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is just me?
[SPEAKER_01]: About 36 minutes is the limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: When there's two of us, they'll listen.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good news times, folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start this one off with a big
congratulations to Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the club, Oregon.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon enters recreational era with tax
free pot sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: October 1st documented the beginning of
recreational pot sales in the state of
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a lot of friends out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to my Oregon crew,
the PNW crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you guys are out there enjoying
recreational cannabis sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got an article once again from the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was written by Jonathan J.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cooper and Bob C.V.
[SPEAKER_01]: of the Associated Press.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a cool pair of names,
Jonathan J.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cooper and Bob C.V.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just when I think I was going to ready for
another dab, you say some really high shit
[SPEAKER_02]: and remind me why that's probably not a
great idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to take a dab?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's celebrate Oregon's recreational
cannabis with taking a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Consider my arm twisted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll twist the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got two rigs on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let you hit the email and then I'll
go ahead and take the one that requires a
[SPEAKER_01]: torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a dab over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a carb cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take myself a medium shmedium
dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, I want you to take a dab with
me, first of all, but then I want you to
[SPEAKER_01]: find me on social media, either Facebook
or Twitter, or you can even email me if
[SPEAKER_01]: you want, but I want to know how big of a
dab do you take?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you take a 0.1?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you take a 0.2?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you take a 0.3?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you take 0.4 or do you do a fucking
half gram dab?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me what you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find me on Facebook as grow from
your heart, or if you want to search me
[SPEAKER_01]: out on Twitter, find me on the little
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a at GFYH podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know how big of a dab you prefer to
take.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're looking for regular dab size,
not this one time my friend dared me to
[SPEAKER_02]: take a?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I want to know, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're about to just pull off a dab for
yourself, if it's your normal day,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're dabbing, I want to know what you
pull off, what's your average,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then tell me how many of those you
take in a dab session also, because if you
[SPEAKER_01]: take a half gram and you only take one of
them, then that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take 5.1s, that's cool also.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to know how you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I myself like to take a whole bunch of
0.3s.
[SPEAKER_01]: 0.3 is about where I like to be,
and I like to take a bunch of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: like about six or seven of them sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: On a lunch break, I'll take 3.3s is what I
like for a lunch break.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a dab right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, I'm hitting the hit,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that hits really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You all remember how bad I cough?
[SPEAKER_02]: No cough, a little cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So recently I picked up a mothership
knockoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really, it looks just like a
mothership Klein, but it was- It's
[SPEAKER_02]: thinner, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the glass may be a little thinner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so much the- Well, yeah, maybe a
little bit the glass weight too,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the overall size of the rig,
the cylinder going up is thinner in
[SPEAKER_02]: diameter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it may be a little bit shrunken of a
ship, but it was a fifth of the price of a
[SPEAKER_01]: mothership.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hits like a truck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hits a great rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to Elevate in Colorado
Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I've said that once or twice this
show, but I've been buying a lot of glass
[SPEAKER_01]: from them and I appreciate the hookups.
[SPEAKER_01]: This little hit, man, hits like a goddamn
truck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to act like I'm not trying to
choke and trying to act like I've got my
[SPEAKER_01]: breath together and everything,
but guess what?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's almost no resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's straight from nailed along.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some chokeage is expected.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just get a fat rip every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like I'm getting my brains back
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you guys, when I take a big dab,
it sounds like Charlie Brown's,
[SPEAKER_01]: the adults in the Charlie Brown cartoons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is what it sounds like after a big dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it takes me a minute to dig
through that hole, but I feel like I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are celebrating Oregon having
recreational sales of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the club, Northern Brothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're the cool kids now.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's get into this article.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from Portland, Oregon,
and it says, excited shoppers looking to
[SPEAKER_01]: score some of the first recreational
marijuana sold legally in Oregon,
[SPEAKER_01]: bought up baggies of bud early Thursday,
taking advantage of door buster prices and
[SPEAKER_01]: other deals.
[SPEAKER_01]: God damn, that's such a poetic opening
line for a news article.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoever wrote this is majestic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I'm high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the more than 250 dispensaries
that already offer medical marijuana in
[SPEAKER_01]: the state welcomed recreational users soon
after midnight, just moments after it
[SPEAKER_01]: became legal to sell to anyone who is at
least 21.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really long sentences in this
article.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much for the majesty.
Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: At Shango Premium Cannabis in Portland,
co-founder Shane McKee said the first sale
[SPEAKER_01]: came about a minute after midnight and
many others quickly followed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's not only historical for folks
in Oregon, but nationwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime people started selling that as an
alternative to alcohol or tobacco,
[SPEAKER_01]: he said in a telephone interview,
Brad Sussman, co-owner of Canna Daddies in
[SPEAKER_01]: Portland said more than 90 customers
bought pot in the first two hours at the
[SPEAKER_01]: store opened at 7 a.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people were out there at midnight
buying weed out there at 7 a.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: buying weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like when a new video game goes on
sale, something like that lines out the
[SPEAKER_01]: door.
[SPEAKER_01]: People just buying weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm torn with this story.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, I'm elated that another state is
joining the legalization ranks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad they they're celebrating.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad people came out and that the
lines were good.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of medical shops are converting,
so supply might not be the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been another legal states,
which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, it's time to knock
off the shenanigans and step all the way
[SPEAKER_02]: up into the legal industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to put your best foot forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to fuck it up for everyone?
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were a couple of things about
the rollout in Oregon that could fuck it
[SPEAKER_02]: up for most of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Half of the state has banned shops,
period.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other half of the state allows a
shitload.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look at a map, it's like right
down the fucking mountain range in the
[SPEAKER_02]: middle of the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: The coast side approves and there are
shops everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other side of the mountain range.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a single shop, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: And stuff like opening at midnight when
there are hours that you're allowed to
[SPEAKER_02]: open and not allowed to be open and they
don't involve 1201 in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the main reporter covering
marijuana up there that I follow on
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of her colleagues was handed marijuana
gummies outside of the shop waiting in
[SPEAKER_02]: line doing news reports.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was just handed free pot candy,
pot edibles, specifically candy or fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: banned.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're giveaways like and it's not like
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's three strikes on day one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's I mean, it's a celebration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shenanigans happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a truck driving up and down the
street, not at all affiliated with the
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensary we were waiting in line at on
January 1st.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was giving out plants, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the funniest shit ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: He drove by and threw out bags of edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: He drove by and gave out plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm 90 percent sure it was somebody
advertising for another shop that was not
[SPEAKER_02]: at all getting business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it might have just been one of us who
had blown his stack with joy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could have gone either way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't get up close and investigate
because I didn't want to lose my awesome
[SPEAKER_02]: spot in line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because by then I was halfway through a
two hour line.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's some shenanigans to be
expected.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's day four or seven now or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whenever this is going to air,
we've had a week now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every ID gets checked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every rule gets followed.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a problem with the rule,
get a lobbyist and get a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Change the rules at the state level so
that they work better for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should already have a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't just fucking skirt it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Different kind of lawyers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's it's really important now
that if you're in the legal industry that
[SPEAKER_02]: you step all the way up, we have to put
our best foot forward right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every state, you guys, every state and
every upcoming state this applies to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the medical shops in California had it
all tried to put their best foot forward
[SPEAKER_02]: ever from 1996 till now, it would have
been fucking legal a decade ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: bitches.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, just like in Colorado,
we had to deal with Dr. Reefer.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Boulder City Council right now is
talking about dialing regulations back
[SPEAKER_02]: down to reality because we've gotten rid
of and I fucking quote the Dr. Reefer's of
[SPEAKER_02]: this world like they're done now.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all out of business talking about
how they used to own a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't even know that one of my buddies
owned a shop called Dr. Reefer in Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: Springs, do you?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember the kid that used to sell us the
Hindu Kush?
[SPEAKER_01]: Vaguely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Reefer.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a the Dr. Reefer in question is
the one up in Boulder.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had a twirling sign guy and that's what
everyone in Boulder was fired up about.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is wildly inappropriate twirling
sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we can't have twirling sign guys in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're specifically banned because of
this buck.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can you can twirling sign for your tax
return place.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can twirling sign for cheeseburgers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can twirling sign for El Pollo Loco,
but not for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't for your vape shop happens all
the time.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're way off topic here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get this article has more
words written in it and they say he said
[SPEAKER_01]: customers told them they've been writing
waiting all their lives for a moment like
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They expected to sell $60,000 worth of
marijuana throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were no reports of arrests or other
problems involving the early sales in the
[SPEAKER_01]: state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most stores plan to open later in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon is one of four states that have
legalized the sale of recreational
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Business began in Oregon with far more
dispensaries than did Colorado or
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington state where pot shops have been
up and running for more than a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alaska could begin retail sales next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Charlo Green,
Foster Buds PDX.
[SPEAKER_02]: She might be going to jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been following that story.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, she has not or I have not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Her outfit keeps getting raided because as
you said, shops not till whenever they're
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to do like a distribution club of
some kind.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Charlo, take care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't end up in jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need you out there fighting the good
fight for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where am I?
[SPEAKER_01]: Foster Buds and PDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Foster Buds PDX in Portland had a couple
hundred customers since opening just after
[SPEAKER_01]: midnight, shop manager Ken Martin said.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just been a steady flow, he said,
adding that employees repeatedly refill
[SPEAKER_01]: jars with pot to meet the demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two customers came in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get used to that shit, people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just keep filling those jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll get used to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Writing down how much came out of the bag,
which bag number, which jar it went into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've watched it a billion times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two customers who came in had just turned
21, he said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Davia Fleming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I read your name right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Davia Fleming of Portland, the first buyer
in McKee's store said the atmosphere was
[SPEAKER_01]: upbeat for the launch of the new industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the end of prohibition, said Fleming,
who uses the drug for medicinal purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, have I ever mentioned that I was
the first person to buy recreational
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis at the Greener Side Dispensary in
Pueblo, Colorado?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was first, bitches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I'm pretty sure I talked about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like way a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: The store offered its first 25 customers
35 to 40 percent discounts and was handing
[SPEAKER_01]: out soda, coffee, juice and other
refreshments, McKee said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many stores in Oregon were trying to lure
customers with extended hours,
[SPEAKER_01]: food giveaways and discounted marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shoppers have one more incentive to buy
early and often.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under Oregon law, pot purchases will be
tax free until January, the savings of up
[SPEAKER_01]: to 20 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get people to come in and see how it goes
and then start charging tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one thing I really like about Oregon's
law is they're really looking to kick the
[SPEAKER_02]: black market in the balls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no taxes for the first little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's the old street theory
that they threw at us in middle school and
[SPEAKER_02]: there you get a taste that cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want a free joint?
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the quality control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the quality increases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the guy being there on time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll hit you in the nuts with the taxes,
manana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting to get hooked.
[SPEAKER_02]: No more watching how it's made for two
hours so that it doesn't look like foot
[SPEAKER_02]: traffic.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just walk in, have your mind blown with
awesome weed product and then bounce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The article goes on to say store owners
say they're hopeful they can avoid the
[SPEAKER_01]: shortages and price spikes that followed
the start of legal sales last year in
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington and Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alaska could begin retail sales next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I already read that, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: One store offered a goodie bag with
t-shirts, but no free marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another will have a live ban and 10
percent discounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Several stores have erected billboards in
Portland.
[SPEAKER_01]: A shop in Merlin is advertising on the
radio.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just trying to basically stock up for
maybe four or five times what the normal
[SPEAKER_01]: volume would be, said Chris Byers,
owner of River City Dispensary in Merlin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Customers can buy as much as seven grams
at a time of dried marijuana flower and
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf, the part that's generally smoked,
plus plants and seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dried flower and leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully there's not a lot of leaf in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, basically buds is what they mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the people that write weed
articles need to hang out with some weed
[SPEAKER_01]: heads.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the next year, so pot-infused candy,
cookies, oils, and lotions will be
[SPEAKER_01]: available only to people with medical
marijuana cards as the state works on
[SPEAKER_01]: retail regulations for those products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon has a robust supply system that has
supported medical marijuana users and the
[SPEAKER_01]: black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Companies have invested in massive
warehouses in Portland to grow the drug
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors, and southern Oregon has some of
the nation's best conditions for outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growers don't face strict regulations yet,
so the supply can more easily flow into
[SPEAKER_01]: retail stores than it did in Washington
and Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still there is concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: Summer has historically been a time of
marijuana shortages in Oregon,
[SPEAKER_01]: and most of the outdoor crop that is ready
to harvest, and most of the outdoor crop
[SPEAKER_01]: is not ready to harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I skipped a word there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indoor growers have had minimal time to
ramp up production because lawmakers only
[SPEAKER_01]: approved the October 1st start date three
months ago, and they had time to get one
[SPEAKER_01]: quick crop in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have kind of a seasonal growing market
here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not commercial though, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Said Jeremy Pratt, he said, we kind of
have a seasonal growing market here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon, said the owner of Nectar Cannabis,
which has four stores in Portland.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have lots of products in the fall,
and then it kind of gets tight this time
[SPEAKER_01]: of year anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reno Oasis, which has two locations in
Portland and more on the way, has prepared
[SPEAKER_01]: by trying to cultivate strong
relationships with growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will entice customers Thursday evening
with an outdoor band and offer 10%
[SPEAKER_01]: discounts to those who spend at least $40,
Cohen or Matthew Schwimmer said.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know of anyone else doing a band,
and we thought it was a good idea to give
[SPEAKER_01]: back to the community, Schwimmer said.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the article, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big congratulations to the state of
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have now got recreational cannabis
sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is tax free until January.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're doing the circuit,
make sure you go stop in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you get yourself, is that where
the fucking donut shop is that everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: talks about?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where those donuts are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go get some tasty donuts, and then go get
yourself some recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out the donuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been eating too many donuts lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: But shout out the donuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go get yourself some recreational cannabis
in the state of Oregon, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, make sure you're 21, and make sure
they check your ID.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they don't check your ID,
call them out on it and tell them that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not following the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gonna fuck it up for the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you listen to the show and you haven't
had a chance to legally purchase cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: start saving for a plane ticket.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're 21.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're 21.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're 21.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll just change your world.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I think of what I used to deal with
to buy weed, what was just standard when I
[SPEAKER_02]: was in high school and in college and then
in my 20s, it was just a nightmare,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially in retrospect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just life when it was happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't that bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't mind watching how it's made that
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now that it's totally legal and I work
in a pot shop and it's just like picking
[SPEAKER_02]: up a cheeseburger on the way home,
it's so much better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was afraid of it at first.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so much better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't adequately put it into words.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I came from the black market and I
was afraid of all of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, I don't know, freaky to a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a huge change.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you live in a non-legal state,
you worry about, I don't know how much
[SPEAKER_01]: weed you buy, but when half of it is gone,
you start thinking about, fuck,
[SPEAKER_01]: where am I gonna get more weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's no reliable spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never have to think, where am I gonna
get my next bag of weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if I don't grow it, I can go to
the shop in which I work or I can drive to
[SPEAKER_01]: one of my other buddy's shops or I can
drive to one of my other friend's shops or
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also a medical marijuana patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could drive to a medical,
this Spencer, excuse me, I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: burp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can drive to a medical marijuana shop
and get whatever cannabis I need in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is a little bit better that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made herb more available, way more
available.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made weed more advanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: The innovations that have come with this
legalization have been incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's way better, but I was,
I feared this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so much better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Legalization is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do so many things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's not so, like I never had trouble
finding pot before in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It never came up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have trouble locating good pot or
the same pot and it was always horse shit,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever you bought.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was never what they said it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just, you'd ask, do you have any of
this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'd go, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'd go get a handful of something
different and be like, yeah, this is the
[SPEAKER_02]: name you said.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just believed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the best you had.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully you weren't getting cheated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was just life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there's 10 stores within a 15 minute
drive from both our homes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's pretty much true across
Colorado at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can go to two or three of them and
see what you do and don't like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every shop's got different pricing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every shop's got a different selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are major companies across Colorado
where you can kind of find their stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of like Coke and Pepsi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you don't have to go to a Coke and
Cola store.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chiba Chews, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chiba Chews, Incredibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in almost every shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Edipure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's a handful of major edible
companies that are everywhere now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel bad for the delivery people.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot of pay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Paperwork.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dixie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's a bunch of them and it's just
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: You walk in and there's 30, 40,
I mean sometimes only five or six,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there's a selection of buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get to look at them, smell them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get to know the price.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's not weird that you drove to
someone's house and spent 20 minutes in
[SPEAKER_02]: their living room and you don't want to
buy this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just thanks and leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't like, if you go to a
dispensary and you don't like what's in
[SPEAKER_01]: there, you can leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to buy anything there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: People ask me what the minimum purchase is
and it's like nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't want any of this,
please, you don't have to buy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'll show you around everything and
you can leave knowing what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then go look at a few other places.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can buy nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like half the time when you do that,
I give you a coupon book with everybody in
[SPEAKER_02]: the town listed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like just give you something to do for the
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So guys, don't feel obligated to buy
something if you're in a dispensary and
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't like what you see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your money.
[SPEAKER_01]: You work for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not wasting their time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a store.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go in there and do what you need
to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a marijuana fan, you're going to
like what you see in almost any shop you
[SPEAKER_02]: go to, especially if it's the first shop
you go to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went, I was in Colorado Springs hiking
one day and I had a friend with me that I
[SPEAKER_01]: had hash with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just travel with dads.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't usually take flowers with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call the, you guys that aren't Colorado
connoisseurs, we call the buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just call it flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I didn't have any flowers with me and
somebody wanted to smoke some weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're driving and I was like,
look, a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we pull up, dude, I would not smoke
anything in that fucking place.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could not have paid me to smoke
anything in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking left.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, no, no, thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what's wrong?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, it all smells exactly the
same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's no difference on any of these
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was, yeah, I just left.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't need anything out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've left many a shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just some of them aren't up to par.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them only still exist because
enough of the population legitimately had
[SPEAKER_02]: to stop smoking weed 30 years ago because
it was too risky for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And only now that they're retiring and
that their kids are grown, are they
[SPEAKER_02]: getting out and trying to buy weed again?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, for 30 years, they didn't know who
to call and were too worried about asking
[SPEAKER_02]: their friends and neighbors about losing
their jobs or custody of their kids or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they just didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they can just pull up to a shop,
walk in, ask for an 8th.
[SPEAKER_02]: A ton of the people I talk to every day
have super silver hair and huge smiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been working outside of the shop
lately at my job that I've been doing is
[SPEAKER_01]: just required some cleaning of some shit
that's taken about a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been out in the back with a door
open and I see a lot of people walk by
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's a parking area over there
and they walk by me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the people that I see are older
folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a lot of young punks buying weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's older folks that used to smoke back
in the day, like you're saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: that have kids that are in college now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, you see them come in and you
see a 20 something college kid come in
[SPEAKER_01]: with his mom or his dad and they go buy
weed together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's really funny to see that
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the 21, 22 year old people I see
are on family vacation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get a lot of younger people,
too, but definitely the tourist economy is
[SPEAKER_02]: retirees.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think about it, it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're 22, there's no reason to fly to
Colorado to buy weed except for the
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoyment of buying legal cannabis and
getting to see what the selection and the
[SPEAKER_02]: hype is all about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, 30 people were happy to
sell you a bag of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or at least one or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no reason to come here and spend
the money on the flight for what you can
[SPEAKER_02]: do at home already.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're 65, there's still a lot of
risk in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's none here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just blows people away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear that at least twice, three times a
week.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, where I'm from, this is really frowned
upon.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would get in so much trouble for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone would think bad about us if they
knew that we were here doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, please don't tell my friends and
family.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, lady, you're from Georgia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know none of your people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know none of your people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to call your congregation
and watch the security footage.
[SPEAKER_02]: She bought a chocolate bar with weed in
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, if you come here and you get
some weed, don't try to take it home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke it all here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke it all here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't finish it, call me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can drop it off at my spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of locals that are happy
to help you finish the bag you
[SPEAKER_02]: overpurchased.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is it is legal to give your weed away
to somebody who is over 21.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got cannabis and you bought it
in Colorado and you're about to get on the
[SPEAKER_01]: flight and you're about to fly home or
you're about to drive back across the
[SPEAKER_01]: border, stop at the last gas station in
Colorado before you hit the border or
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking while you're at the airport,
you see some dude with some dreadlocks and
[SPEAKER_01]: try not to give it to someone who's at
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get well unless it's me because I
can take weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't actually if they have dreadlocks,
that last statement doesn't apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, if you're if you're walking
through the airport and you got extra weed
[SPEAKER_01]: on you and you see somebody with
dreadlocks, they just flew in and they
[SPEAKER_01]: need some weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just hand them your bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just maybe I should rephrase that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, OK, so the guy that works in
McDonald's really wants your unfinished
[SPEAKER_02]: bag of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: He could really use that kind of charity
and sort of pat on the back.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you give it to him at the drive
through window, he's going to get fired.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were trying to do something nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So have him meet you outside real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Catch him in the parking lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gotten way off topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gone for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's wrap up this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Mike, thanks for coming over,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look like you're beat by now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm ready to go home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grub something, take another dab and pass
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then I'm going to let you do that.

[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to get a bunch of people
on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might take a bunch of big, fat,
ridiculous dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big old round table of a bunch of coffin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A square table with a bunch of coughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
