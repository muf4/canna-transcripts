[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 109 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, if you're a new grower,
if you're a professional grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're a new smoker or a veteran
dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or
[SPEAKER_00]: even someone who's just curious about the
current state of cannabis, this,
[SPEAKER_00]: my friends, is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Ross the Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for letting me use your music on my
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to Kat, Coop, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope everybody's having a great afternoon,
morning, evening, whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: wherever you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you got something rolled up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you got a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you got a vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you got an edible in you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you got something good going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're getting turped out in some
way, shape, or form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, this is another episode that
comes from the car, but this is sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: part two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently I did an episode about ways to
improve your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is a part two of that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: More ways on how to improve your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also include a little rant toward the
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did have to stop recording halfway
through because I arrived at my
[SPEAKER_00]: destination, but I did start recording on
the way home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a little cut in the middle,
but I hope you enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I go too far, this podcast is
brought to you by my good friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the crew at Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you support Hitman Dougie and
the entire Hitman Glass crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hitman Glass is made in America by
Americans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we are hitting the Hitman and
Sampson collab.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of my favorite rigs in my
collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got like a, I'd say a six inch tall
can with a straight up, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the piece where the bolt or the nail
attaches go straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a mouthpiece that comes out of
the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a beautiful green worked base,
maybe a turquoise color in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a green Hitman logo here on the
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a green Hitman flame across the
mouthpiece there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do myself a fat favor and
we're going to take a dab and then we are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get into the part of the podcast
where I'm in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to start heating up this
nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to let the music fade in and
then I will be in the car the next time
[SPEAKER_00]: you hear my voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friends at Hitman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you guys follow Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check out HitmanGlass.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you support them on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you follow Hitman Glass Dougie.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a bunch of members of the Hitman
fam.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you type in a hashtag hit fam,
hashtag Hitman Glass, you'll find a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of great glass that you would like to
follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd like to see more of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks for supporting the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get on to the part with me in the
car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just before the lights go off,
I need to go make sure that the timer
[SPEAKER_00]: shuts off appropriately and make sure that
all the heating and cooling works the way
[SPEAKER_00]: it should for the night cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check on some clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, been spending a lot of time on the
road.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a lot of time at home or
studio time the past week.
[SPEAKER_00]: This weekend was the Dude It's Gatsby
Invitational.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I spent most of the weekend in Colorado
Springs with the Grimey Gatsby family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I spent most of the weekend in Colorado
Springs with the Grimey Gatsby family,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Dude It's Damsel crew and the Turpex
boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recorded two podcasts that need to be
edited and put together from the weekend,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they will be out pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be episodes 110 and maybe 112.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might put another episode between there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know what I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've got a couple of episodes coming
to you from the house in Colorado Springs
[SPEAKER_00]: where we hosted the Dude It's Gatsby
Invitational.
[SPEAKER_00]: The house full of models and dab kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a pretty good time, I would have to
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend that you guys go to
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're on Instagram, go to Instagram
and search the hashtag Dude It's Gatsby
[SPEAKER_00]: and check out some of the shots we took
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also check out some of the shots on Dude
It's Damsel's Instagram and also on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Grimey Gatsby on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, you can check out my new
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iri Underscore Genetics on Instagram is my
new page.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did start a new Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I don't know if I've mentioned
that on the podcast yet, but I am back on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to follow all of the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been told that you can't put photos
of yourself consuming cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means no dab videos, no fat joint
shots, none of that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was told that you can't have contact
information on your Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to put any contact
information up there just to keep us safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know how to find me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you go follow the new Instagram
page.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at 19,000 followers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took me down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am already back up to about 15 or 1600
by the time this airs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully with all of the shout outs and
things from Damsel from the weekend,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be close to the 2500 mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that's enough rambling about the
Dude It's Gatsby Invitational.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really encourage you guys to go look at
some of the pictures that were taken on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will also post a podcast that tells
you all about the Dude It's Gatsby
[SPEAKER_00]: Invitational, what it is, who was involved
and why it happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to edit that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got stupid high you guys, so it'll be a
fun show to listen to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, I'm driving on the interstate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hard to read because I'm driving,
but I wrote this down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been watching a show on Netflix,
a show called Narcos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a show about Pablo Escobar and his
drug empire that he created.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no idea the dude was so huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew he was huge, but I didn't know that
this dude was super huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy, I've never seen that kind of
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody else has ever seen that kind of
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude was building forts out of
hundred dollar bills, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, something that happens in the show
Narcos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Narcos is on Netflix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 10 episode season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend you watch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that happened recently made me
chuckle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to come out on the show and say
that shit will not work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pablo Escobar is standing on the balcony,
having a little thought time by himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just thinking and reflecting and
staring off into the nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he turns to the right and there's a
ganja plant to the right of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nowhere near done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pablo just grabs a little bud off the
stalk and pinches it off and gives it a
[SPEAKER_00]: good smell and sticks it into his pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may do a little for him, but that
weed is going to suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant was not finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just pick buds off of a plant
randomly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like an apple tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to harvest it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to trim it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to dry it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to do it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a little goofy, but everything
about the cocaine, about the production,
[SPEAKER_00]: the shipment, everything about cocaine
seems to be accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've talked about how they make
cocaine, how they process cocaine,
[SPEAKER_00]: how they hide cocaine.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that has seemed to be fairly
accurately done, but when it came to
[SPEAKER_00]: growing a little bit of weed, they had no
idea what they were talking about on that
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I wanted to mention
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about the Dude It's Gatsby
invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to go through my notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast is going to be a follow up to
a recent show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, I did an episode that was aimed
at how to improve your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I posted that show, I realized there
were a couple of things that I really
[SPEAKER_00]: skipped, things that I've been thinking
about that would definitely help you
[SPEAKER_00]: improve your crop that I should have done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've mentioned in that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me scroll up on my phone here while
I'm driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, guys, you got to be patient with
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to do this safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: More ways to improve your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to talk about the importance of
pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hear that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to talk about the importance of
pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH stands for potential hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH is super important for your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're making a solution,
when you're mixing your nutrients in your
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket or in your reservoir, however
you're mixing it, you need to adjust the
[SPEAKER_00]: pH before you feed it to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix up all of your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have everything in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a pH meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stick your pH pen, your pH meter in there
and see what the pH says.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's like seven, it needs to come down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, you want your pH for your plants
to be somewhere between six and 6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you'd be much happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants will look better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll take up the nutrients more
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants will grow better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't see as many problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times a pH problem will mask
itself as a deficiency or a nutrient burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just go ahead and fix your pH,
you have to fix the pH of the solution
[SPEAKER_00]: you're feeding your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're feeding it nutrients,
if you're feeding it water, adjust the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys are feeding it teas,
don't mess with the pH of a tea because
[SPEAKER_00]: the tea is organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to add something to bring down the
pH of your tea will probably kill off your
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes and whatever you're trying to
build up in the tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let that go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't stress too much on the pH of your
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you bought good soil at a grow store,
your pH will be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you're feeding it properly pHed
nutrients, a properly pHed solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you're done mixing up your nutrients,
pH it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a pH pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stick it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what it says.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add very little pH down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a five gallon jug,
it's not going to take much pH down to get
[SPEAKER_00]: your pH to drop massively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of people skipping that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think it's not important.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think it's not going to mess with
their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think it's just one more thing to
worry about, but it's one more thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: can definitely improve the quality of your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adjust the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, let's talk about the importance of
getting the lights close enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of people with their lights
real high in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using Gavitas, you do need that
three foot gap, but unless you're using
[SPEAKER_00]: double ended bulbs, there's no need to
have the bulbs way high above the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got the type of hoods that are
ducted and have glass inside of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you're venting them properly,
and the room is air conditioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can probably get those light
reflectors right down on top of the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: really close.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a section that comes off the bulb
that is kind of too bright for the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and those lumens, I guess they are,
that are coming off the bulb right there,
[SPEAKER_00]: that spectrum is too much for the plant
right around the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That eight to 10, maybe 12 inch circle
around the bulb, but if you get a little
[SPEAKER_00]: further, about 10, 12, maybe 14 inches
away from that thousand watt bulb,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to get optimal growth right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can cool it and keep it cooler,
you can get closer and pay attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants and see what's happening,
but I see a lot of people that have their
[SPEAKER_00]: lights way too far away from the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your plants closer to your lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to get that light right on there,
nice and intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light is the most used nutrient that your
plants will receive, so make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: flood them with light, and also try to
give them the appropriate light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in the veg cycle, you want
lights that lean more to the blue
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in the flowering cycle,
you want lights that lead more to the red
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you've got enough light,
try to get your plants close to the light,
[SPEAKER_00]: and use as much as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, you can burn your plants with your
light, so pay attention to that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but get them close.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, what does my next note say?
[SPEAKER_00]: My next note says CO2 enrichment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't write a lot of notes about this,
but CO2 enrichment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to improve the quality of your
crop, if you want to make your plants grow
[SPEAKER_00]: more quickly, more heartily, and if you
want bigger, fatter harvests, add a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of CO2 enrichment to your growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go to the grow store and you can
get tanks of CO2, and you can get a setup
[SPEAKER_00]: to distribute the CO2 properly through
your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to rethink your ducting and
your ventilation situation if you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to do that, but CO2 will drastically
increase the quality of your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not the quality completely,
but the harvest weight, you will
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely see a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ambient air outside and in your grow
room probably contains about 400 particles
[SPEAKER_00]: per million of CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get an enrichment system,
maybe a CO2 burner, maybe some tanks,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you decide to do, you're going to
have to think about that one and talk to
[SPEAKER_00]: the guys at the hydro shop, maybe do some
research on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to put CO2 in your room,
you're going to need to think about how to
[SPEAKER_00]: do it, but what my point is, you can get
that CO2 up to 1,600 ppm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get it four times what it is in
the natural environment, and your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: will love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants want to suck up the CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can add CO2 to your grow, and that
would greatly increase your harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to add CO2 and you're
going to start getting bigger buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: something that really helps with all
gardens and something I'm learning now
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm running this giant commercial
garden is trellising.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, trellising and a screen of green
method, if you can set up a scrog,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is a huge way to improve your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will give yourself more canopy space.
[SPEAKER_00]: More canopy space gives you more room to
grow more buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wants more buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you're able to get more airflow to
the bottom of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that a scrog is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do a whole episode on how to do a
scrog when I'm in the studio and I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: on the road because I definitely want to
pay a little bit of attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spence and I talked about it a while back,
but I wasn't sold on the idea and I wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly sure how to do it, so I didn't do
the idea justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will talk about how to scrog on a
future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use some sort of trellising system,
a screen of green, a net.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get those plants in there and get them
supported.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get them spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would definitely help with your
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that I see a lot of people
neglecting to do that I think would
[SPEAKER_00]: greatly improve the quality of your
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will also save your trimmers a lot of
headaches, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would be really useful for you
to get in there and lollipop your plants a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is, from the bottom of the
plant up, take off all the branches that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have a useful bud site.
[SPEAKER_00]: The areas that don't look like they're
going to create a chunky bud, just cut
[SPEAKER_00]: those off.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 10 days into flower, you'll know
where you're going to have buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the light is not getting to that area,
just pinch that little starter of a bud,
[SPEAKER_00]: just pinch that right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those little tiny sucker stems that
are growing off your main stalk at the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom of the plant that are going to make
little shitty flowers that nobody wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: trim, cut that shit off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will allow that plant to use its
energy to produce bigger buds up top.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't have all that crap on the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get better air flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say they want to use those
bottom buds for hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool if you want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to grow buds with bag
appeal, big fatty chunky nuggets,
[SPEAKER_00]: cut that stuff off of there and you will
have better results, you'll have better
[SPEAKER_00]: air flow, and then you won't have to trim
all that little popcorn crap because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what sucks at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that just gets chopped up and put into
the hash pile anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do some lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in there and clean all the bottom
buds, all the bottom crap off the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: before it even has time to suck up the
nutrients and suck up the energy of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get that right off of there and allow
that energy to go up to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that people really don't think
about that I think could truly benefit the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of your garden and the health of
your plants, the overall health of your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's winter time here in Colorado and the
grow room floor is getting cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: My personal grow is in a basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I would recommend to get your
pots up off the ground, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your plants off the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: A really easy way to do it if you can't
build something, if you can't build a
[SPEAKER_00]: table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend getting a four by four
botanic hair tray and just build yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: a little table that will support the tray
and your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just lift it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever is comfortable for you,
two to four feet off the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually about 30 inches is the height
people go.
[SPEAKER_00]: 36 inches is kind of high for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need it that high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get your plants up off the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: The floor is cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want those cold pots on the cold
floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to water them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water is going to stay in the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got water down there in the root
ball and that water is going to get cold
[SPEAKER_00]: because the floor is so cold when the
lights go off at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raise your pots up off the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to tell you a cheap and
effective way to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy an extra pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running a seven gallon pot and
you've got your plant in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: get yourself another seven gallon pot and
flip it upside down and just set your
[SPEAKER_00]: seven gallon pot right on top of there and
you'll be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a cheap, effective way to get your
plants up off the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to look like your plants are
happier just one night of having them up
[SPEAKER_00]: off the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll grow more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds will develop much larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll taste better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants will act happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: That cold floor will also disguise itself
as a pH or a nutrient problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be thinking, what's going on with
my crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your floor is too cold and your plants are
pissed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't like to get up in the morning
and walk across a cold floor on your bare
[SPEAKER_00]: feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make your plants do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get them up off the ground and that may
help you get them a little bit closer to
[SPEAKER_00]: the light as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have just put you in danger of
getting too close to the light,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's something that the trellising
we're going to talk about in another
[SPEAKER_00]: episode will help you out with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your plants up off the ground,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to get out of the traffic
area so I can't really look at my notes
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I'm driving right here, I'm just
going to give a huge shout out to Hitman
[SPEAKER_00]: Glass because Hitman Glass sponsors the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing like taking a fat dab out
of a Hitman rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting out of the traffic area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can look down at the phone once again
and see what the next one is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check your PPMs of your solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you guys are mixing up your nutrients
to feed your plants, pay attention to the
[SPEAKER_00]: PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: PPM stands for particles per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will tell you how much stuff is in
the water or the solution that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: created.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using reverse osmosis water,
it'll start off at zero PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most tap water is going to come out fairly
low.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tap water where I am at home comes out
about 400 PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It changes seasonally.
[SPEAKER_00]: They add stuff to it, but we're usually
about the 400 PPM area.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know what you're doing,
you can feed them really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten into the 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: People tell me I'm crazy for feeding my
plants 2,000 PPMs, but I'm paying very
[SPEAKER_00]: close attention to what I'm giving them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not doubling up on anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting a broad array of nutrients
instead of just getting really heavily
[SPEAKER_00]: blasted with phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend that you don't go much
higher than 1,200 PPMs when you're mixing
[SPEAKER_00]: up your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you can do if you've got a big
reservoir ... This is going to be a little
[SPEAKER_00]: harder if you're using a five-gallon
bucket because you don't get as much
[SPEAKER_00]: wiggle room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a 25-gallon res or a
50-gallon res from the Hydro Shop,
[SPEAKER_00]: fill it up maybe like 40 gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a 50-gallon res,
fill it up to about 40 gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a 25, fill it up to about 15
or 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, mix your nutrients the way you
normally would.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your PPM meter in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to show you that it's too high
right now, but all you've got to do is
[SPEAKER_00]: just run normal water, or if you've got
reverse osmosis water, just add normal
[SPEAKER_00]: clean non-solution mixed water to it until
it comes to about 1,600 or 1,800 PPMs and
[SPEAKER_00]: feed that to your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can mix it up and then dilute it until
it's at the right dilution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything will be at the right ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've still mixed the same amount of Grow
A, the same amount of Grow B, the same
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of Cal and Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything will be the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just you've kind of diluted it to a
proper solution that your plants are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, take notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feed your plants the solution that was at
1,600 PPMs and see how they react.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think you want to mix it a little
heavier next time and mix it up to 18,
[SPEAKER_00]: feed it to them and see what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go too heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go past 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to your PPMs, but I think
that is something that will really help
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy just passed me on the right going
about 90 miles an hour playing on his
[SPEAKER_00]: phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't talk too much shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing a podcast while I drive,
but still at least put your phone down if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to pass me on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I'm coming up on the
Fillmore exit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go handle some plants at the
Green and Healthy Wellness Garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be back in the car in just a couple
of hours and I will do more of this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast and we will all have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World, I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your boy, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got done putting in about two and a
half or three hours in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to fill up some reservoirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got three gigantic reservoirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a drip system set up to where
every about two and a half hours,
[SPEAKER_00]: the drip system comes on for about a
minute and a half and waters the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just have to make sure that the
reservoirs are full, that they're filled
[SPEAKER_00]: and they are mixed with nutrients and
properly pHed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I checked on the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clones look marvelous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really good at cutting clones and
rock wool, but this batch is looking
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty nice for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I checked on all the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants look glorious, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today is day two of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're taking off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see that they've already started to
stretch a little tiny bit since yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds ridiculous,
but they have definitely done some growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I checked the tanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I checked the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I checked on all the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants look happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're starting to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not showing, but I mean,
they're starting the flowering phase now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I had to tinker with the Gavita
controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working all set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants are going to be super duper
happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm on the road headed south back to
Pueblo from lovely Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is now dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: The temperature has dropped dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am just now headed past the which exit
am I at here?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Fort Carson, the Mesa Ridge Parkway,
Fort Carson exit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at mile marker 132.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of that is relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just talking because it is what's on
my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back to where we were,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode was about ways, more ways to
improve your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about CO2 enrichment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked a little bit about trellising.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about trellising for a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trellising, we'll go back to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trellising is when you take like a net,
like a five by five net with about either
[SPEAKER_00]: four inch or six inch squares,
spaces between the netting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got about four inch or six inch holes
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would take the net and just,
you got to stretch it tight, but build
[SPEAKER_00]: like a five foot frame or attach it to
some poles and just lay that right over
[SPEAKER_00]: the canopy of your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: While you're in veg, just drop that right
over and pull it tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what I do is I grab the branches
from the plants and I make sure that one
[SPEAKER_00]: branch is sticking through each square of
that trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this will, it'll do a few things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll separate the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where you don't have a bunch of
branches all clumped up into one area,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will allow more of the plant to get
more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will also work as a support for the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the plant starts getting chunky buds
and the plant starts getting taller and
[SPEAKER_00]: stretching, it's going to need some
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every branch will be supported by this
trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll also spread the plant out and
it'll give you a little space and it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: do, it'll create what I call the little
grid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to grow on the grid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have more bud sites per square foot
than most people because you have gone and
[SPEAKER_00]: stretched out your canopy and spread it
out in this trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in veg, a couple of weeks before
flower, drop that trellis on and start
[SPEAKER_00]: making the plants grow into the trellis
and get them stretched out the way you
[SPEAKER_00]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would recommend flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they're all up through there,
you've got a node coming through every
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're comfortable with the height of your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys, if something's getting too
high, all you got to do is grab it and
[SPEAKER_00]: bend it down back under that trellis,
and then it'll start growing up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis wants to grow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it'll do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you bend a branch down and stick it
in that trellis, it will grow itself back
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after a couple of weeks, you put the
plants in flower after they've vegged into
[SPEAKER_00]: the trellis and grown comfortably,
then you put them in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just a couple of weeks after
flower, maybe 10 days after flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend putting up another
trellis, maybe less than 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe seven days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put up another trellis, just about 18
inches higher than that first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants are going to start budding,
and they're going to grow right into that
[SPEAKER_00]: trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe 16 inches if you're at a home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going about 18 inches to give them
some space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe 24, just depends on how fast they
grow by then.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you want them to grow up into that
trellis to where those top colas have more
[SPEAKER_00]: space to lean.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to kind of lean on those
trellis wires.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you pull the trellis tight
when you put it up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it at the right height to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull the branch nodes through that
trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful not to break them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't be shy to get in there and just
kind of reshape that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it go the direction you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then get it growing into that trellis
squares.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then add the other trellis a little
bit into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then keep the buds growing through
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll be able to create more bud
sites, more buds, more harvest weight
[SPEAKER_00]: without adding more light or without using
more space in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I find that to be a huge improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something else I want to touch on,
you guys, this is a major important factor
[SPEAKER_00]: that people overlook.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say that cleanliness is next to
godliness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something that would really improve
your garden, you guys, just clean up after
[SPEAKER_00]: yourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in the garden and clean up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't need to be in there,
take it out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to have the broom and
dustpan in there overnight when you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a trash can in your grow
room, make sure there's a lid on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend taking that trash can
out of the grow room at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have anything in the room that
doesn't need to be in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean up all that crap in the corner,
whatever you've got over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's your nutrients, if it's your
notes, if it's your gear, clean that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take that out of the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got leaves on the floor,
get those leaves up off the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's something I'm going to kind of
contradict myself with, but I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really important to have a super clean
grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cleanliness will keep bugs away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cleanliness just helps you keep everything
more organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps healthier plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's something that I'm going to add
to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around week six or seven, your plants are
going to start getting really sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to start producing resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichomes are going to get fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are going to want to stick to
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a girl or a dude with long hair,
you'll notice that every time you walk
[SPEAKER_00]: past the ganja plants, you leave some hair
in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a pot photographer, you'll
notice that every time you try to take a
[SPEAKER_00]: picture, that one killer bud has got a dog
hair or a people hair or a kitty hair or
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of hair in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm getting at you guys is these
sticky plants love to collect everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to give them about 21 to
25 days of straight sticky collection
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be sticky for three
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that whole time, they're acting like
fly paper and just collecting everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that's in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my advice to you guys is try to control
the dust that's in the air in your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to control the particulates and hair
that is flying around, that are flying
[SPEAKER_00]: around in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to minimize all of that stuff because
it's going to stick to your buds and end
[SPEAKER_00]: up in your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these days, most of the people in
Colorado, in California, in a legal state
[SPEAKER_00]: that are producing a grow, at least half
of the grows are being turned into
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts, which means they're being
blasted with butane.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're being turned into water hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're being turned into some sort of
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to happen is you're going to
take... So you're in your grow room,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're not cleaning up after yourself
and you're mixing soil for your next batch
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever you do in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get dust all in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get soil all in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that shit is going to stick to your
trichomes, all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to smoke those
plants and they're going to taste like
[SPEAKER_00]: dusty dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to extract it and
make hash out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all that dust and dirt and shit and
dog hair is going to be in your
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really recommend you keep the grow
room clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to minimize dust and hair in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a carbon scrubber,
just throw a tall carbon filter on the
[SPEAKER_00]: floor, point it straight up, put a blower
on top of it, and just put that sucker by
[SPEAKER_00]: your door, kind of near the door,
so that way any air that is drawn in,
[SPEAKER_00]: any particles will get sucked up by your
carbon filter, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also on any intakes going into the
room, I would recommend putting a HEPA
[SPEAKER_00]: filter over all of the holes or all of the
ducting into the room, so you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing in crap from outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely don't recommend bringing in
air from the outside that has not been
[SPEAKER_00]: filtered and treated for temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now it's the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were to bring in... It's going to
be probably 20 something degrees tonight,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm guessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're running your lights at night
and you bring in that 20 degree air over
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants, you're going to cause powdery
mildew issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're bringing in frosty cold air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're introducing it into a warm grow
room environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great way to create powdery
mildew situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to what you're bringing
in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my point, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every leaf on the floor is a spot for a
bug to hide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every piece of crap that you've got in
there is another place for a bug to hide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a place for a mold spore to start
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cleanliness is very important in the grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what I've got for you for
ways to improve your garden for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for listening to
another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that the car episodes are up
to my quality standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sound quality and the amount of
attention I am allowed to give a show
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't seem like it's fair to the
listener.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to probably stop doing the car
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do a car episode, it'll just be
something ranty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't be something educational or
detailed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you made it through this episode,
I truly do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back next week with the Dude It's
Damsel or the Dude It's Gatsby
[SPEAKER_00]: Invitational Recap that features the
lovely Dude It's Damsel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got Hunt on the mic for a little bit
of that show and four other lovely ladies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend Chris from The Clear jumps in
for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have that edited and cleaned up and
ready for you guys by next Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got seven days to get that out for

friends at Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hitman Glass, glass made in America by
Americans.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I've said it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm shopping for a rig, I like to
know that what I'm paying for is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: give me a big fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to get water splashed to my
face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to get a dry dab because
there's not enough water in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, don't trust a rig that was made
in China by a Chinese kid with no eye
[SPEAKER_00]: protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably wasn't wearing shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't get paid enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't buy some glass made in China,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy American glass made by an American.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make you feel better.
