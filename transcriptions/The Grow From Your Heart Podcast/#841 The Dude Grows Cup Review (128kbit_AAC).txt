[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 841 of the grow from your
heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: In today's episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to review the dude grows cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you've heard me talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dude grows cup just happened this past
weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to jump into that right after we
talk about the new sale at irie direct
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check irie direct.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've reduced prices on femseeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've restocked a bunch of new things up
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are two new testers available
for this month to testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got two different phenotypes of the
same strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is Durban poison number one and Durban
poison number three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've both been pollinated by the same
male.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the BC lemon skunk male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot decide which phenotype I like
best the number one or the number three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put them both out as testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can run them.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what comes from your gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that will help me make my decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is new stuff in stock at irie
direct dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you hit irie direct dot com for
that new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough advertising at the start of
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said we're going to talk about the dude
grows cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the dude grows crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dude Scotty real banner guru maestro.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a bunch of people that
I don't remember behind the scenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you guys all get credit to you guys
want to remain in the shadows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will allow that big fist bump to the
backup crew and the spotlight crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entire dude grows the staff the crew
and of course the dude grows crew itself
[SPEAKER_00]: the army that comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course a big shout out to the army.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let me stay focused here because I am
I've been sampling all the goodies that
[SPEAKER_00]: people sent me home with from the DGC Cup
and I am well medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the crew that threw the
party.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was bigger and badder than last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tent was bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were more people.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a lot of great boots a lot of
great interaction going on a lot of great
[SPEAKER_00]: displays.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were full grow tents set up in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah there were full grow tents set up
under this tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more about that in just a few
seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Cup was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Briefly I'll tell you about my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Friday afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike showed up in my house a little
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We drove up to Fort Collins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I expected usually three and a half hour
drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took us closer to four hours and 20
minutes ironically to get up to our hotel
[SPEAKER_00]: in Fort Collins.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interstate was against us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I-25 wanted everybody to have a bad day
that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not let it stop us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kept our spirits bright.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kept our heads high.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Puffco may have helped with that
operation but we made it to Fort Collins
[SPEAKER_00]: checked into the hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honest we walked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We checked into the hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used the restroom in the lobby and we
did not even go to our rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We said hey we got shit to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went and grabbed a quick meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even remember where we went for
dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went got quick food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that we headed to the Dude
Gros Pre Party.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a party happening at the Dude
Gros Festival site.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to give away the name of the
farm or tell you exactly where it was
[SPEAKER_00]: because some of that needs to be a secret
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we headed to the party site.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I took in with me that night was a dab
rig and smoking accessories went in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and we smoked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hung out with a bunch of great people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pre-party was a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a bunch of cool people there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even want to start saying names
because if I miss people then I feel bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Mike and I claimed a table.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found a nice spot kind of right in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: A nice level table because I had my dab
rig with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course it was on a farm and some of the
ground wasn't completely level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not complaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I found a table that I felt
comfortable putting my rig on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the rig set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took a bunch of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hung out with a bunch of great people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike and I sat at one side of the table
and mainly there was a couple that sat at
[SPEAKER_00]: the other side of the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out for hanging out you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then other people rotated in and out
all night.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: People came and smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: People came and said hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: People had some food.
[SPEAKER_00]: People had some drinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: People had some snacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: People showed me a bunch of great weed and
a bunch of great concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: People came and said hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: That party went very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wrapped that up and then we went and
got some more food because we were hungry
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by that point Mike and I were
both pretty beat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we headed to our separate hotel rooms
where we finished the night solo and then
[SPEAKER_00]: met each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like I'll meet you right out here
again at nine thirty in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we met up at nine thirty right outside
of our hotel rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some coffee because Mike needs
coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I needed a muffin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got some quick snacks and that's when we
headed to the Dude Groves Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: The official day was Saturday.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real party was Saturday.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys Saturday was a blur.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pulled up to the DGC Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a lot of empty parking spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a nice prime spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We loaded in really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got set up by 10 30 11 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to start doing business at noon
when the event started.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly come bombard the table get
get early get there early get the best
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not shy about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what Mike and I noticed about
eleven fifteen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pulled out my rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put water in that rig about eleven forty
five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found my banger and attached that to the
rig about twelve thirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I finally found my carb cap around one o
'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found the dab right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was approximately two thirty p
.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: before my booth slowed down before it was
finally time for me to be able to take a
[SPEAKER_00]: big fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not complaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we got into the DGC Cup around 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got set up around 10 30 or 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: I scooped up a dab and people started
showing up at the booth by eleven fifteen
[SPEAKER_00]: eleven thirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were swamped and I did not get to take
a breath until approximately two thirty p
[SPEAKER_00]: .m.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for three or four hours there we were
completely bussing completely busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people came to the booth and said
hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people of course bought seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people grabbed that new Golden
Girls bundle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was probably one of the hottest
sellers of the weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were so many people there wearing
irie genetics and irie army gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all the folks that came
out and supported the irie army supporting
[SPEAKER_00]: irie genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure many people are wondering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said there was a free prize or a free
gift for the people wearing the gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave everybody wearing irie army
merchandise a two pack of cherry skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cherry skunk fems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you briefly about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is J.R.'s cut of cherry paloma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course cherry paloma is from raw
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: J.R.
[SPEAKER_00]: found a winning cut that's been going
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course I ended up with the cut of that
and then I hit it with that skunk number
[SPEAKER_00]: one when I did that skunk reversal
pollinated that cherry paloma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we made some cherry skunk seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave two of those to everybody wearing
irie gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure that there are some grows some
households that ended up with four or six
[SPEAKER_00]: of those seeds because if you came
together with your girl or your best
[SPEAKER_00]: friend all three of you got the seeds if
you're all wearing gear and then people
[SPEAKER_00]: got six beans I'm sure people are running
those already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got friends running them already from
that but I'm sure people from the cup have
[SPEAKER_00]: already got them sprouted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what the people rocking the irie
gear got was a two pack of cherry skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: fem seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells exactly like you would think it
would smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that robust cherry citrusy turp
and then it's got that skunk back end on
[SPEAKER_00]: top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real nice plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what everybody got for wearing
the gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the day went by super quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually they were like hey guys we are
going to announce the winners of the
[SPEAKER_00]: event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like how is it five o'clock
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they announced the winners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Hot Rod.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hot Rod took fifth place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not recognize any of the top five
winners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never heard of any of them before.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number one winning strain was the
Black Maple 22.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do not remember the name of the
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for not remembering that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have had some notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But shout out to our boy Hot Rod.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got either fifth or sixth place with
his Biscotti OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good work Hot Rod.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also bro random note our friend Hot Rod
just moved and relocated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't get a lot of details
because that's none of your business.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to send a big shout out to my
buddy Hot Rod.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hot Rod good luck out there in the new
spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do hope everything goes well for
you buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're still a part of the Army.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though you left Colorado I totally
understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where am I.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the award ceremony happened and then
after that everybody went the fuck home.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was not a lot of time from here's
first place and the place was empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It emptied out super quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the guys a lot of the boys a lot
of the gang made some plans to go eat some
[SPEAKER_00]: dinner and do some things after the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately it took Mike and I way
longer than anticipated to pack up the
[SPEAKER_00]: booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course we were stoned and rambling and
chatting and having a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't packing up at any high rate of
speed but we packed up the booth got it
[SPEAKER_00]: all in the car and then got out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we realized we needed some more food.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to go get some food so we went hit
a semi-quick restaurant got some food
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaned ourselves up a wee bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we boogied out to Scotty Reel's
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went to the bakery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Scotty Reel for throwing two
separate banging parties in a row possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: three parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a party previously that I did
not attend but shout out to Scotty bro you
[SPEAKER_00]: threw some super good parties that
weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: We left the DGC cup win got food then went

[SPEAKER_00]: But it was a super chill party at Scotty
Reel's house.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hung out outside for a little bit on
the back patio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoked a little bit then headed into the
bakery where Untrained Astronaut turned on
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaf blower filled with weed and
smoked us out so much that my eyes burned
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense bro but you toasted me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was lit after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was a super good party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually Mike and I decided we were
toasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mike and I headed back to our
respective hotel rooms where I said I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: meet you back out here in the morning bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we woke up the next morning where we
traveled to Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just headed down to Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some food.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just had a slow start in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't do anything real crazy for the
start of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got moving kind of slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But eventually we did meet up with a bunch
of great people at Meow Wolf.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were already there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were running a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't late or nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just we'll see you there kind of
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a bunch of great people were at Meow
Wolf.

around Meow Wolf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw more people in and out as people
came in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty cool bumping into Airy
Army.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were noticing that there was a big
group there that wasn't just because we
[SPEAKER_00]: all knew each other and the other patrons
of the place were starting to look at us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like who are these guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: We ended up hanging out in there's a
lounge in Meow Wolf called Sips.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ended up hanging out in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have some mocktails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a mocktail.
[SPEAKER_00]: No stress here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't drink alcohol but the mocktail was
delightful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike had a lemonade.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hung out and then we called it a day
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually Mike and I were beat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had been a long weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: My throat was starting to hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: My voice was getting dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: My social battery was running out and I
said hey Mike we got a two hour drive home
[SPEAKER_00]: buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he looked at me he said let's boogie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we hopped in the car and we headed
south.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got home and the stubborn guy in me
took two fat dabs and went to a drum
[SPEAKER_00]: circle that night.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know crazy right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up at the Pueblo drum circle at
Pillars Park.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come hang out one time you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a party.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was useless at the circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I'm high energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a lot of input.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of creativity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was slow bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not killing it that night.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that ladies and gentlemen is the quick
version of how Mike and I did the dude
[SPEAKER_00]: grows cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: No grow information in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was all just ramble and chatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the cup was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great experience in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: My opinion the whole time was a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could do more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm behind my booth the whole
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did get out from behind the booth and go
explore for a brief moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not even pee at the DGC cup you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how busy I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was an amazing event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next time I'll make more of an effort to
get out and do more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go say hi to more people.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people come and say hi to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw so many friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's people I need to go say hi to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Derbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up buddy?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good seeing you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And big shout out to Duke Diamond.
[SPEAKER_00]: He stopped by the booth and said hello as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's follow up on the plans that we've
made.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Duke and I have spoken about some plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know what could happen there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spoke so many joints that I'm recording
later in the weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: My voice is still raspy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I talk into the mic real slow you could
hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some Barry White going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is all DGC cup raspiness there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sinuses feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I get the sinus funk when I go
into a big group like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sinuses are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just all dab throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can fix that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to everybody that brought me
a gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came home with a ton of great gifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you guys for all of the gifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some toys and prizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some homemade things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Delilah for the homemade
gifts that she sent me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do appreciate both of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of my favorite gifts, and I'm not
going to choose favorites here and talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about it on the show, but my favorite
gift, bro, I'm totally going to do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: was the lemon Jeffrey concentrate from my
buddy Frosty McNuggets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey bro, I'm drooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm shaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got some more of that lemon Jeffrey
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need some more of that, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hit me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's work out something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make a deal is what I think they
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Frosty McNuggets is lemon Jeffrey
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit was hot fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do need some more.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite parts of the DGC cup,
you guys, everybody took a bunch of weed
[SPEAKER_00]: and everybody was trying to be friendly
and everybody was trying to be generous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like want some of the weed that I grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like some of my weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone's like, but I have a quarter
pound of weed too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So eventually at one point I decided I'd
grab a handful of small nuggets and just
[SPEAKER_00]: throw one nugget at a time at my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole iry army was set up on either
side of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a picnic table that we moved over
and commandeered to make part of our
[SPEAKER_00]: little smoke sesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just started pegging people with nuggets
and then guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They started pegging me back and we had a
weed war.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a good festival when you
can just throw weed at your friends and
[SPEAKER_00]: just toss weed around and leave a bunch of
weed in the field when you're done and not
[SPEAKER_00]: be stressed about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grower's love.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weed tossing party was a real good
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to meet a lot of people from the iry
army that I had never met in person before
[SPEAKER_00]: and people that I had met that my brain
doesn't remember because I smoke too much
[SPEAKER_00]: and have a traumatic brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good seeing a bunch of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the guy with the cool dunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the guy who started a
breeding company to honor his fallen
[SPEAKER_00]: friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly loved and appreciated and
respected your story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many cool ass people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to follow my notes,
but I'm so way off track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to everybody for all the
love and the fist bumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met a lot of fellow podcasters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to meet Chad Westport.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chad's even cooler in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just as tall as me in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Chad Westport.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool to meet that dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met Ikan Matt from Ikanibus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ikanibus Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not as tall as me, but a super cool dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brings good vibes and a sharp dresser.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely noticed a dude with some
dressing skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I got to meet Michigan Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan Matt came to his booth and
introduced himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuck his hand out like a gentleman and
said, Jeff, I wanted to come by and
[SPEAKER_00]: introduce myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was good to see that dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cool meeting fellow podcasters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, fellow podcaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to hang out with Blue Kiss Gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I've met her before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Blue Kiss, but she did get to come
to the event, hang out a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: harass us a little bit, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody loves Blue Kiss's energy at the
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, shout out to a couple of my friends
who drove from New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you guys want your name
said, but I'm going to call you R and W.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to call one of you bubble lungs
because by the end of the event,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro, your lung sounded like the bong when
you spoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: But shout out for driving all that way,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to one of those guys doesn't
know a lot about the army.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just kind of got introduced into the
crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's my friend for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know each other from fish shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: He drove all the way from New York to come
out to the DGC Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to those boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Brie and Quinton,
people that I always look forward to
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing at the DGC Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went by so quickly, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The booth was hopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to see a lot of great people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of fist bump, lots of handshakes,
lots of hugs, lots of selfies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we took a selfie, if we took a photo
together, please send it to me or post it
[SPEAKER_00]: and tag me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to repost those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love those moments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saved those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a cheesy guy like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But please do send me that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to send a big thanks to my buddy
Mike for helping me at the booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, I could not have done all that shit
without you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop by.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe you some dabs and some more than
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Share some of these gifts I got with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some great gifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to Ry Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ry wasn't even supposed to help at the
booth, but he saw that we were busy and he
[SPEAKER_00]: helped in.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows me real well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he jumped in and helped out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to all of the DGC.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fucking DGC makes it awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without the DGC, I would just be a guy
standing there with the booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys make it all worth setting up all
that stuff, taking all the gear,
[SPEAKER_00]: carrying all those shirts, loading up all
the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a long time to prepare for the
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I package a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had special packs made just for you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big thanks to the DGC for inviting me,
for having me, for treating me like
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks to the Irish Army for showing
up strong and bringing all the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, of course, once again, big shout out
to the dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got your name on the festival,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, really, thank you for the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the invite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the love and respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The podcast camaraderie, the growers love
and just the bro shit, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, same to Scotty Real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real quick, I want to send a big shout out
to my buddy Scotty Real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, shout out to Grambo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grambo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the show going, my bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stay funny, my dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, big shout out to Banner for trying
to keep shit organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also big shout out to Jay Maestro
for spelling everything correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I think that's what I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next year, you guys, I vote for a two day
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want a two day Dude Grows Cup next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two days, maybe even three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do a Friday night pre-party,
just like we've been doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a pre-party Friday night, drop off all
the samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Saturday and Sunday, we've got more
time to focus on sampling all the samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, I know you've heard about it,
but I would agree and appreciate and
[SPEAKER_00]: endorse a concentrate event involved in
the Dude Grows Growers Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that is my review.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my update.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my opinion of the Dude Grows
Growers Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, thanks to everybody who came
out, stopped by the booth, said hello,
[SPEAKER_00]: bought a pack of seeds, grabbed a t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you just came and said hi and
didn't buy anything, big shout out,
[SPEAKER_00]: big thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great weekend for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to seeing you next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did not make it to the Dude Grows
Growers Cup, have no fear, because next is
[SPEAKER_00]: the secret stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me grab my phone and verify the date
of the event, because I said the wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: date in my head recently, and I don't want
to do that to you, because I like you kind
[SPEAKER_00]: folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The secret stash is happening in Denver,
Colorado, June 22nd.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a much different event than the DGC
Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a much shorter event, a much
smaller event.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are given a shopping window.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you buy your ticket, you are given a
one hour time slot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are let in the building for that one
hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can visit all of the booths you'd
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you are politely, what is it called?
[SPEAKER_00]: Escorted out the back door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that is where you are welcomed to the
party.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of booths outside where
you can get, I hope that the cheesecake
[SPEAKER_00]: guy is out there, big shout out to Bubba's
Cheesecakes, and various food trucks and
[SPEAKER_00]: vendors outside, but the inside seed
breeder area is a very quick shopping
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a one hour window, which is enough
time, you guys, but it speeds you up,
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets it going, and it makes things much
easier for the vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can meet capacity without keeping
that building too crowded.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of advantages to these sort of
events, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives me a minute to rest between
phases also.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first hour goes through at like 11 or
noon.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that hour, I get a five or 10 minute
break to clean up the booth, take a drink,
[SPEAKER_00]: take a dab, take a piss if I need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that stuff makes for a better
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Secret Stash, June 22nd in Denver,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want information, there should be a
link in the show description or the video
[SPEAKER_00]: description or show notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put a link in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the Secret Stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look forward to seeing you in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long have we been going?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, I'm going to make this
[SPEAKER_00]: just a DGC Cup Experience episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I'm going to talk about is the DGC Cup
in this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to wrap this up.

give your mama hug for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rasta Jeff, you bad mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time to take another dab.
