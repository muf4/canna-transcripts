[SPEAKER_01]: hit record, go ahead and click subscribe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the podcast, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This of course is episode 789 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I know I said 789 on the last
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not the best at counting, but I am
pretty good at growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, we are going to give away
a free pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've teamed up with my friends at
SeedsHereNow.com to give you a free pack
[SPEAKER_01]: of iry genetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk more about that later in this
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a lot of fun stuff to ramble
about here at the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to start off by giving a couple of
shout outs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a big shout out to a
comedian by the name of Joe List.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to see Joe List live at ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe List kind of downplays his comedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't talk about how many tickets he
sells, about how many people show up to
[SPEAKER_01]: his show.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's kind of self-deprecating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when he showed up to the comedy
show, you realize he's doing much better
[SPEAKER_01]: than he leads on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thank you to Joe List for a great
comedy show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also a big shout out to ComedyWorks for
hosting a great show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, a big shout out to Zara for
being a perfect comedy show date.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next thing to talk about is orangegasm
seeds will be back in stock on I redirect
[SPEAKER_01]: very soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seeds have been harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are in a little container.
[SPEAKER_01]: All they need to do is be counted and
packaged into individual packages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I can put them on the website and
get them to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will do that very soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have an exact time or date planned
or in mind for when I'm going to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Life is very busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a lot of things going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get them out as soon as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: The easiest way for you to stay in touch
and stay updated on how to get that drop
[SPEAKER_01]: as soon as it happens is the first people
that will get the update is the Patreon
[SPEAKER_01]: members.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people that participate on Patreon at
the seven dollar and 10 cent above level
[SPEAKER_01]: will get the first notification.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shortly after that, the people that
subscribe to the four dollar and 20 cent
[SPEAKER_01]: subscription on Patreon, they will get a
notification.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I feel like enough people from
Patreon have gotten their seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: then I will send out a newsletter to sign
up for that newsletter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to my website.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read genetics dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scroll down to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be a spot to type in your email
address.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will get a notification that says you
have successfully subscribed to that email
[SPEAKER_01]: newsletter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when I do the drop for the
orangegasm, you will get an email with a
[SPEAKER_01]: link directly to I redirect so you can
grab those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I will also make an update and post a
link to the discord server.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will go to discord somewhere in the
ivory army discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will make sure everybody sees it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will say, hey, there are orangegasm
seeds here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Click this link.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll go in the order of Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be the Patreon seven 10 members,
then the Patreon four 20 members,
[SPEAKER_01]: then the newsletter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then shortly after that, it will be the
discord server.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure you're either on Patreon,
the newsletter or discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: The newsletter and discord are absolutely
free to join.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please do jump on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, Patreon will get first dibs
at the new drop of the orangegasm seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do we go from there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it says here to remind you that every
order does come with freebies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of those freebies will be
testers.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do get testers, I do highly invite
you to join the discord server on the
[SPEAKER_01]: discord server.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a tab that says I read genetics
testers.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you click on that, you can see the
progress of all the tester seeds that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: sent out from the people that have decided
to join and participate in the discord
[SPEAKER_01]: tester tab.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to post one or two pictures
there, that is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to post a weekly update there,
that is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to post full written out grow
reports there, that is just as great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Details and information as you want to
share.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're one of those people that wants
to type out a whole bunch of shit,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really interested in reading all of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Post all your details or info type about
your gear, your equipment, your humidity,
[SPEAKER_01]: your temperature, what you're feeding,
and then post photos or just post a
[SPEAKER_01]: picture and say what strain it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most important part, if you are going
to post them, the tester tab is please do
[SPEAKER_01]: include what strain you are testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to include a name or at least a
cross on the package to identify it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can clearly talk about what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please do include that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know what you're talking about on
the tester tab, but when you do order from
[SPEAKER_01]: I redirect, everything will come with some
free seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those may be tester seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be clearly marked on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they are tester seeds, you'll get a
little, I don't say testers, you'll get a
[SPEAKER_01]: little card with a link to the discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a QR code.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can scan that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should take you right to the discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can join, hang out, then talk about
all the testing on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's all the rambling I want to
do here at the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a couple of great emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's jump right into those.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one says, yo Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to start by thanking you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good way to start a message.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on to say, I purchased the bundle
off of I redirect as a Christmas gift to
[SPEAKER_01]: myself and man, did you deliver?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Occasionally I will post random bundles to
I redirect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put a bundle pack and I tell you how
many seeds comes in that pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put a very greatly discounted price
on that bundle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then people buy that bundle and they
don't know what they're going to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a prize bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a grab bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just a bunch of random seeds in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make sure to load it up and make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well worth the price that you paid,
but you have no idea what's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be new stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be old stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be regs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be fems.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be unreleased shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be overstock shit either way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make sure that you're going to be happy
with what you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's older stuff, there's so much of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's new stuff, you're going to be
blown away by the cool shit you've never
[SPEAKER_01]: seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also sneak in some testers and freebies
and all of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, occasionally I do throw out those
bundles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since you've got faith in me and trust
me just to load it up for you,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's why I really hook you up with
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I should keep moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says the new packaging is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a weird way, it seemed like you
knew what I want or what I don't have or
[SPEAKER_01]: what I wanted to buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you threw that in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks again.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of cool compliments in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The new packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys have not seen the new
packaging from iReGenetics, hit iReDirect,
[SPEAKER_01]: grab some seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a good chance that the John Lemons
will come in the new packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Big Mountain Fudge Cake will
definitely be in the new packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some of the fems have their own
custom package designs on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So grab some seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says onto my grow question.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the point of this, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any tips on keeping a grow
room warmer in the winter?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure if you've been following along,
you know that when I switched from LED
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting, I went from HPS to LED lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of ruined a whole entire crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stupidly, it was my decision,
my move.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did that in the middle of the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was negative 17 degrees outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I decided to take down the HPS lights
and hang up LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: That room got super fucking cold because I
was relying on those HPS lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: To keep that room warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it did not work with the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The LEDs put off basically no heat
compared to what the HPS lights were
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have struggled with this before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do need to keep that grow room,
that grow space warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: My solution, and you said you can't do
that or don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my solution was to hang more lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just put the HPS light back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the LEDs are where they should be in
their area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just put HPS up over on the
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what's heating up the room now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically working as extra light and
as a heater.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, it does go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, my wife and I recently purchased
a new home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a big thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially at this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, and in this home, my new grow
will be in the basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all started in the basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where most of us start.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, she is always hot and I am always
cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we compromise and just keep the house
cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was 58 degrees in there yesterday
morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is kind of cold for a grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, the room isn't huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about 110 square feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's about like a 10 by 11 room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also don't do not own HPS or ceramic
metal halide fixtures anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hesitant to use a standard hot coil
space heater due to fire risks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some ideas, but this is another one
of those, what would Rasta Jeff do
[SPEAKER_01]: situations from our friend?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they call themselves F a plant count.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that F that plant count.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I do strictly follow the plant
count here in Colorado because of all of
[SPEAKER_01]: the rules, but I know what you mean F a
plant count.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we keep a basement grow space warm
in the winter?
[SPEAKER_01]: I did write down a few ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, my first option would be just
to get a safe heater.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you don't want one of those
dangerous space heaters, but you can get a
[SPEAKER_01]: quality heater.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's 2023.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the eighties.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the seventies anymore,
or those heaters are super dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are quality heaters available.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can buy an industrial heater or a
residential heater.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can set it on the floor in a safe
spot, or you can put it up on the ceiling
[SPEAKER_01]: in a safe spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can mount it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you follow all of the
manufacturer's recommended rules and
[SPEAKER_01]: safety precautions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to say that to keep myself out of
trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything you do is your
responsibility and your fault.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I should say that just to keep
that's for just for legal purposes here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would recommend just a normal small
heater.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a 110 square feet room.
[SPEAKER_01]: A very small heater should be able to warm
that space.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can run that heater when the lights
are on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can run that heater when the lights
are off.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is one option.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would get a heater and something called
a cap switch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about what a cap switch is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many people aren't familiar with these
types of devices.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're great, great devices.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make them for all kinds of different
things that do you could figure out how to
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can operate a whole row grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could automate an entire room with
just a few caps, which is if you really
[SPEAKER_01]: think about what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a cap switch, the switch plugs into the
wall where the plugin goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first step is to get the cap
switch, plug it into the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a thermostat on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you turn it to the range that you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it'll be within three to five
degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to get like 70 to 75,
turn it there 70 to 75 degrees,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe a little hotter, 72 to 77,
maybe a little hotter depends on what you
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to do, but turn it to where you
want it, set it on the range at which you
[SPEAKER_01]: want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you plug the heater into that cap
switch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you turn the heater knob to where
it's on at medium or high, however much,
[SPEAKER_01]: however much intensity you want that
heater to bang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe if you put it on medium,
it won't be banging high intensity all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may last longer, less risk of problem,
less risk of fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've turned the heater on medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got one of those manual, those
switches that you have to turn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get a digital heater because that
will not work with your cap switch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to get the analog kind with the
knobs that you can turn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get the turning knob, turn it on to
medium, get that bitch going, plug it into
[SPEAKER_01]: the cap switch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's a cord that comes from the
cap switch.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's got a thermometer on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang that in the middle of the room,
maybe right above canopy high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then that thermometer will hang right
above the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whenever it gets too high or too low
for that temperature, if it's too low,
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's under 75 degrees, that'll say,
Hey, it's under 75 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will turn on power to that switch,
which will turn on the heater.
[SPEAKER_01]: The heater will heat up as the room heats
up that thermometer hanging in the middle
[SPEAKER_01]: of the room will say, Hey, it's as hot as
we need it to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll tell that switch, Hey,
turn off the power to this, this plugin
[SPEAKER_01]: right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all you're doing is turning off and on
the power to that plugin by using a
[SPEAKER_01]: thermometer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll say I'm within the range or I'm not
within the range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you've got a heater, that's got a
switch on it that you could turn off on
[SPEAKER_01]: medium, high, low.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, that will work, but a digital
heater will not work for this situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also do the opposite with an air
conditioner.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do a cap switch on an air
conditioner, set it low, set it high,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can tell that air conditioner to come
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put as many devices on as many
caps, which is as you want in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sell them for humidity with a
humidistat on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sell them for heaters.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sell them for coolers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can automate all kinds of things with
cap switches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think about those things a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have some notes that I completely
abandoned here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so the cap switch is your first
choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: A heater is your first choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here are the caps, which is your next
choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, um, if you've got two rooms,
this is what I've done before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a, a veg room and a flower room
next to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: I simply vent the heat from the veg room
into the flower room and the flower room
[SPEAKER_01]: is dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at night it's just heating up that room
using, uh, the hot air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just venting the, I'm venting that
hot air from the veg room over there to
[SPEAKER_01]: the flower room wall to sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will help keep that room warm a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, that's got a carbon filter
and a dehumidifier in the flower room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll clean that air up a little bit
and then send that out of the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just replacing the air
constantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but vent that, uh, the veg room heat
into the flower room may be another idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, here's another thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can think about is flip the schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that may sound crazy, but we do
this in the summer to keep the rooms cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not do this in the winter to keep the
rooms warm?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always going to be a little bit
warmer during the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, maybe only just a few degrees,
especially right now it's snowing like a
[SPEAKER_01]: motherfucker outside in Colorado,
but it's only going to be a few degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: But during the day, we're going to get a
few degrees warmer at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a few degrees colder.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if you put your lights on during the
night to try to keep that part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle a little bit warmer?
[SPEAKER_01]: That may help you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that may keep things dead even,
which may help you out just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, a CO2 burner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe have you thought about adding a CO2
burner?
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2 burner has a lot of good benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to make your plants,
uh, grow bigger, uh, faster and more
[SPEAKER_01]: robust.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll help you use more nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you can use a little bit warmer room
in the summertime, but in the winter,
[SPEAKER_01]: that CO2 burner will heat up the grow
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hooks up to the natural gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works like a pilot light except it's
like multiple pilot lights in a room,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on how big you buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need a big one for this room.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you could just use that CO2 burner.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will burn the CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the same time, it will heat up the
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's if you're going to do that,
do a heater, but why not a CO2 burner?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be just as effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's just as many, if not less
risks, it's probably equal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since I said risks, let me get to the next
part of my notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says smoke alarm and fire extinguisher.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to use a heater,
if you're going to use a CO2 burner,
[SPEAKER_01]: I highly, highly recommend that you do add
a smoke alarm and a fire extinguisher.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't already have that in the grow
space, you guys, every grow space should
[SPEAKER_01]: have a fire extinguisher available and
possibly a smoke detector, either inside
[SPEAKER_01]: or outside of that grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put the fire extinguisher outside of the
grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a grow space where the door
closes, have the fire extinguisher
[SPEAKER_01]: outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause if a fire does happen in there,
you don't want to have to go in there to
[SPEAKER_01]: get the fire extinguisher to put it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to be able to kick the door open
and careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: The door knob may be hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've all seen the movie backdraft,
but open the door, start spraying,
[SPEAKER_01]: be prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: So have that fire extinguisher.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that smoke alarm.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me check on the notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure I didn't miss anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like I covered all of the notes
for this question.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend F a plant count.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do see your name on Patreon all the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see your name pop up on the YouTube a
lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for all the support,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, thank you for the great
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I was able to help you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got any followup questions,
please do reach out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how to contact me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got another message here on the table
that I would like to read.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came from my friend shoe trader,
one Oh one on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't pay me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't sponsor the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly don't use them, but all of the
organic guys, they grow with organics and
[SPEAKER_01]: do the build a soil program.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear great success and great success
stories with that product, with that
[SPEAKER_01]: product line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've also got great customer
service and they're cool fucking people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their Instagram is super cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've never paid me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do a lot of business with them,
but big shout out to build a soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a, uh, one of the, uh,
the bed guys, the, uh, the beds,
[SPEAKER_01]: it does the live soil beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a regenerative guy, what are the
guys that just pull the roots out and put
[SPEAKER_01]: the shit right back in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even think of what that's called.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys would just keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: The no till, no till guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend build a soil to those kinds of
folks all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so you're using a lot of build a soil
products and most of the stuff per their
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says a lot of people would say that
this is due, that the lack of smell is due
[SPEAKER_01]: to genetics, but I have your stuff,
lit farms, raw genetics, exotic genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: soul fire, top dog, and more, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are some of the best breeders on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, you hit some of my
favorites in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's definitely not a genetics issue
and your last run was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it says any feedback would help.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in three, uh, five gallon pots and one
seven gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do pH my water.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our friend shoe trader, one-on-one from
Instagram is having a problem or their
[SPEAKER_01]: last run smelled delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was perfect, but this run does
not have any aroma and flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to try to diagnose and figure
out why with honestly, the little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: information I've got here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the, uh, the, uh,
the VPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know a lot about this other than
some build a soil products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's, uh, let's dig into some of my
ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started off by talking about,
uh, temp and humidity VPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: How is the temp and humidity in your grow
space?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we all know that he will also,
let's talk about one thing before we get
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something I was just talking about with,
uh, the last ramble that I got on,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, this could be a seasonal issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I noticed that since I'm dealing with
different conditions outdoors during the
[SPEAKER_01]: winter and different conditions in the
fall and the spring and the summer,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause I'm in Colorado, our seasons are
drastically noticeable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could tell the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since I'm here, I do notice that some
of my crops are easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come out better.
[SPEAKER_01]: My winter crop, my fall crop, the one
that's done since I've got them scheduled,
[SPEAKER_01]: the third crop of the year, the one,
the one that comes around Halloween.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one's always one of my best crops of
the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's, uh, for a smokable flower or for
seeded flower, it's always the most
[SPEAKER_01]: successful is my Halloween run for some
reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why I don't, I think it may
be the gear and dealing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to cool the rooms as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that's what I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me talk about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've kind of said my way, my way into
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to cool the room as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I get a better stickier taste
to your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is your room too hot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was your last run in a dry season in a
warm season?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did the room get too hot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, maybe perhaps did the room get too
dry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're dealing with conditions
outside that it's hard to correct the
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors and your room got a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe the last crop, it was a different
season.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had that outdoor or that outdoor cool
that Halloween crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I always get that super good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that was your last crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're comparing that spring crop to
your Halloween crop and they're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be totally different just because of
outdoor environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just could be a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not certainly sure that that is it,
but I noticed that my crops are different
[SPEAKER_01]: here at different times of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could be temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be too wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be too dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, too hot, definitely volatizes and
burns off turps too dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't allow turps to produce as much,
uh, too moist will definitely stifle
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, too cold might not be too bad for
turps, but it is going to slow down some
[SPEAKER_01]: shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so let's think about temperature,
humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, then let's also think about airflow in
the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, is there too much airflow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it too windy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine if your turps, your plants,
your trichomes are just sitting there in
[SPEAKER_01]: the wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, if you're on the boat,
if you're on a motorcycle, if you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: the windows down, if you're in the
convertible, uh, maybe you just got too
[SPEAKER_01]: much wind on your face and you just feel
all chafed all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe the plants are getting the same
thing in there, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they're just getting beat up by a
fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I'm not accusing, I'm not pointing
fingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going through my mind,
looking in the grow room, going,
[SPEAKER_01]: what could possibly through my grow space
saying, what could possibly be better?
[SPEAKER_01]: What could possibly be diminishing aroma
and flavor and presence of terpenes in
[SPEAKER_01]: this grow space?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just checking off the list and
seeing what we can identify in your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we're talking about air flows at
too windy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it too stagnant?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not, are you not getting enough air
exchange in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we need to get rid of some air?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pull some fresh air in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That may be part of the situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just looking from the top down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get to the soil at the end
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, did you have any issues?
[SPEAKER_01]: Were there any bugs?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you had any bugs at all, that will
definitely slow down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, trichome production, aroma,
flavor, all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the, the plants will be focused on
different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll just be more focused on protecting
and replenishing the damage that the bugs
[SPEAKER_01]: are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, did you see any visual problems?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, did you get a microscope and look for
any problems?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, did you spray anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, maybe something you sprayed may have
changed the aroma and flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, uh, were you watering properly?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you have any dry spells?
[SPEAKER_01]: Were you overwatering?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you, um, you're using the build a
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you replenish everything after you
harvest it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of that stuff needs to be put back
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you add the bloom boosters?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you add the aroma and flavor
enhancers, which they recommend?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what that is from build a
soil, but I'm sure there's a product.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say, this gives you better flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: This gives better aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you use that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that may have helped out with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, did you overwater?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you underwater?
[SPEAKER_01]: Were you checking the soil carefully?
[SPEAKER_01]: It says you pHed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, were you making sure that everything
was perfect in the soil before you were
[SPEAKER_01]: watering?
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe there was an issue with the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you didn't rebate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you didn't rebuild everything after
the last harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a soil expert, so maybe it could
be a lack of microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it could have been a feeding issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: There could have been a lot of things
going on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, something I noticed, uh, you said this
was happening in the flowering stage,
[SPEAKER_01]: but something else I noticed is that a lot
of people will have really stinky plants
[SPEAKER_01]: all the way up to the end, and then they
don't, uh, dry and cure properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where they lose a lot of the
flavor and aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, that's where people do bring out a
lot of the flavor and aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm sure that by the time I've read
this, and by the time this podcast comes
[SPEAKER_01]: out, that it will be harvest time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's dry cure and smoke time.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did these plants come out,
bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now at the end, uh, now that it's time to
chop them down, how does it smell?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does it taste?
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you dried it and cured it,
then any, did any of that flavor and aroma
[SPEAKER_01]: come out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it could be a dry and cure issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, that comes to a relative
humidity, temperature, darkness,
[SPEAKER_01]: where they kept in the dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, were the lights too close to your
plants when they were growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be something to think about
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were they closer or further away than last
time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did the plants grow taller?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you lower or raise the light?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you forget to raise the light or lower
the light for some reason?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just throwing out there all the ideas
that I could come up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the main thing to think about is what
changed?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is different than last time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that's why I always recommend taking a
lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you write down everything you did last
time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you write down everything you did this
time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Set those notes side by side and say,
Oh, last time in week three, I did this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't do this in week three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I did do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be something you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or didn't do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be an environmental change.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be something major or honestly,
bro, it could be something very tiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did a product change?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did the airflow change?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did your care change?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did your defoliation, your popping,
twisting?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is different?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's once again, that's why I
recommend taking a lot of notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have all the nutrient notes from
last time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you say you're using the build a soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, like I said, maybe that needs to be
refreshed and recharged.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you need to order a few packages
that mix in there for the next crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only other thing I can think of,
and this has happened to me and other
[SPEAKER_01]: people think I'm crazy when I say this,
but maybe you have got what we call nose
[SPEAKER_01]: blind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you just can't smell it or taste it
anymore because you've been around it so
[SPEAKER_01]: much and you've become immune to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stinky people don't know they stink.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we all enjoy our own brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may be sleeping in the house where
that herb is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may sleep there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may wake up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may eat breakfast there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have lunch there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may go about your whole entire day
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: By now you are totally immune to the smell
of that ganja just because you're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's extreme, but sometimes I
just don't even realize that there's ganja
[SPEAKER_01]: in the house and that you can smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll pull up to the house with a
friend, like Michael, come over and
[SPEAKER_01]: Michael be like, buddy, you got to get a
new carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can smell it down the block.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, what do you mean,
bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't smell anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Michael be like, let's go
somewhere and we'll go run around in the
[SPEAKER_01]: car for a little bit and not smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll come back and I'll be like,
ah, bro, I need a new carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, yeah, bro, you just got to
get out because you didn't smell it at
[SPEAKER_01]: all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe, maybe hopefully that's the
situation you're having.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe all the turps are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're growing like a pro and a
champ and you're just so good at growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't even smell that crazy dank
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to improve and make it even
stankier and dankier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there are a few, uh, products,
I guess not products, but a few things I
[SPEAKER_01]: can, uh, recommend that may help improve
that stankiness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a couple of these, maybe a couple of
these and combo maybe one or two by
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always noticed that kelp based
products make my plants that if it's got a
[SPEAKER_01]: skunky or an earthy or a cushy or a coffee
kind of aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, uh, kelp product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm not sure what kelp product
you're going to buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of them, but see kelp in a
product will definitely bring out that
[SPEAKER_01]: funky, uh, earthy, cushy, uh, gassy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those aromas are enhanced by kelp in my
opinion, in my experience, in my grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I may recommend adding more sugars
and more microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will help with everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, carbs, microbes, that, that will
always help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then something I've noticed that makes
plants funky and sneaky all the time is
[SPEAKER_01]: fish products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any ocean products, seabird guano or fish
products, uh, fish emulsion, fish meal,
[SPEAKER_01]: anything with fish in it, uh, will make
your plants it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you put it into the nutrient
mix, into the soil and it's got a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of the proper stank to it,
that stank does transfer into the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stank makes stank.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, maybe add some kelp, add some fish
products, definitely, uh, increase the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of microbe activity in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that may help with your lack of aroma
and flavor, uh, bro, my friend shoe trader
[SPEAKER_01]: one-on-one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I helped you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got any shoes to trade,
definitely do hit me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You all guys all know that I'm a big
sneaker fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got the correct dunk SB lows,
hit me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do some shoe trading.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
