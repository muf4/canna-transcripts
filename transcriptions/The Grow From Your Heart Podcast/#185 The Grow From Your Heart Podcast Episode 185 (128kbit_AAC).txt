[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 185 of the
Grow From Your Heart Podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who is
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I need to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Kat, Koot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everybody's having a great week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I'm starting off your Monday
properly or whatever day you choose to
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people listen on Mondays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to get the week started because I
am having a fantastic week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wednesday was my birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a good time at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my friends were having a fun time with
me wishing me a happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after work, I got to go to a party.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lovely Jenny Beth organized a party
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed up at Jenny Beth's house to pick
her up for dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I walked in, I was greeted with
the classic surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a big old surprise party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see who was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: White Mike was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to White Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris and Lindsay, also known as the
Traveling Stoner and Bobo Blaster Co.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will and Rachel, the Barefoot couple,
were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse and Bern showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the lovely and beautiful
Jenny Beth was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, yo, I got to see Mick the dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys haven't seen Mick the dog in a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was great to hang out with Mick the
dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to scratch him a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good seeing that, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to everybody that came to my
birthday party.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate each and every one of
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was awesome to walk into a surprise
party and see all my friends hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big huge shout out to Jenny Beth for
organizing the birthday party,
[SPEAKER_00]: for putting together food.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, Jenny Beth made sure that
everybody had a bunch of medicated food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she had some cupcakes made that were
decorated to look like vaginas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of the night, everybody ate
a little vagina.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to everybody that came to
the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super huge shout out to Jenny Beth for
throwing me a surprise birthday party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you to death.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, big huge thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge shout out to everybody who wished me
a happy birthday, whether it was on
[SPEAKER_00]: Twitter, if it was through a text,
if it was an email, if you did it on
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook, Instagram, however you wish me a
birthday wish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a great birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still having a great birthday weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a good birthday dinner tonight,
hung out with JB a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm recording a podcast for all my
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things are going very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, Tim from Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if he knew it was my birthday
week or not, but he was giving me a dad
[SPEAKER_00]: and he put a carb cap on my rig.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, oh, that carb cap fits on that
rig better than any cap I've ever put on
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, good, because it's yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Tim for this dope new
carb cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fits perfectly on my banger and it
gives me a really super sweet dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tim and I were talking because my friend
Tim is from New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is, I don't know his exact title to
tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a very high position with a
dispensary known as Organtica in
[SPEAKER_00]: Albuquerque, New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are in New Mexico and you are a
medical marijuana patient in New Mexico,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can highly recommend Organtica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organtica has several great strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not an ad, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just how I feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organtica has Arise on the shelves most of
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their Arise has tested at 32% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might want to try that if you're a
New Mexico medical marijuana patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got Zach Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zach Hayes is named after him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's after a friend of ours who
unfortunately passed away of cystic
[SPEAKER_00]: fibrosis, but he's got a strain named
after him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he will live forever within the
cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Zach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love, missy little brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's what I was getting at with my
talk about Organtica in New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: A friend of mine was talking about needing
medical marijuana in New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, hey bro, why don't you just
drive up to Organtica and go visit Tim and
[SPEAKER_00]: get some of that Arise?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, I would love to, but I'm in
the southern part of the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he replied with, there's a border
check there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought a border check in New
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, yeah, between when you're
coming north from Las Cruces, New Mexico
[SPEAKER_00]: on I-25, there is a border check and they
are checking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also as you're going south.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going south to Las Cruces on
I-25, there's a border check.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they stop you and ask you when you're
coming north, they ask you if you've been
[SPEAKER_00]: to Mexico and they ask you if you have any
illegal people in your car.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I went through it, it was myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I am white.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super white.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no mistaking me for a white guy,
racial profiling or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a white dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: My beard comes in kind of red.
[SPEAKER_00]: My beard comes in quite red.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got blonde hair, blue eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say dude and bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am white.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy that was with me, it looks like he
could be my brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's my best friend, Rob the dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we went through that checkpoint,
they're like, what's up guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you go to Mexico?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he ran our plates and he pretty much
sent us on our way.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knew we were gringos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're looking for illegal aliens and
they're looking for drugs coming north.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to the south, they were never
looking for anything until now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're looking for people taking
their medical marijuana through that
[SPEAKER_00]: checkpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was confused, but then I gave it about
two seconds of thought and I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't drive their medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these guys are their medical marijuana
patients in the state of New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have purchased medical marijuana in
New Mexico and they cannot travel through
[SPEAKER_00]: that state checkpoint because it is a
federally run checkpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they get caught with marijuana,
they will be charged with possession of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis or whatever the charges are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they will probably take the weed at
the least and they'll probably arrest and
[SPEAKER_00]: charge them for crossing a federal border
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to share that with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, if you're in New Mexico, go to
Organtica unless you have to try to sneak
[SPEAKER_00]: through that border.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot suggest to anybody trying to
sneak through a border patrol checkpoint
[SPEAKER_00]: with cannabis in your car.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a medical marijuana patient and
you're having problems like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting your herb and having to travel
with it, you know what I'm going to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow your own cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how you can learn how to grow
your own cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a super smooth segue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can listen to old episodes of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before it was the Grow From Your Heart
podcast, it was called I Grow Culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been putting old episodes
together in large chunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been putting, if three episodes fit
in a block, I've been putting three
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes together and re-releasing them as
one episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not always work that way because
some episodes are going to be longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may only be able to fit two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may be able to fit four or five if the
episodes are short.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like my recording software and
where I post my podcast, it looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: just over three hours is kind of the limit
for what I can put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to go pretty close to three
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've put out episodes one through three in
one chunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I put out episodes four,
five and six in another chunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after I record this, I will put
together the next two chunks of episodes
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll release those hopefully on the
next two Thursdays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been dropping them on Thursdays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you haven't noticed in the feed,
the old episodes are up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys just go look through the feed
through the titles and it says one through
[SPEAKER_00]: three revisited and four through six
revisited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I plan on keeping that going until I
catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm doing it in chunks because people
are asking for old episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of just dropping the old
episodes back in, because what happens is
[SPEAKER_00]: every time a new episode comes out,
an old episode gets knocked out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: feed or only holds a hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of just putting in one,
I'm putting in three and you're kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: getting more or more value out of it that
way without losing something.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my attempt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if I just put one through three,
then it would knock out whatever the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom three were.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just, I'm trying to make it make sense
for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, another solution I came up with to
archive old episodes was YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube does not limit how many things you
post.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can post a thousand episodes to YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have slowly been going and making old
videos for the old episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one through 25 completed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are loaded to YouTube, but they are
not public yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to get up to 50 episodes
before I make it public because people
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to things in such large chunks that
if I don't put 50 of them up there,
[SPEAKER_00]: the minute I release it, somebody is going
to tweet me and say, listen to all 50,
[SPEAKER_00]: I need more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me get 50 up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll make them public.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully while you savages dig
through those old episodes, I'll be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to produce the next 20 or so and try to
stay ahead of you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to do it until I'm caught
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently I'm recording episode 180.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm recording episode 185 and I've got 25
videos made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got 160 videos that I need to
make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes a little bit of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for the quality of the first
20 something videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't real good with the record or with
the video making software.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, I'm just kind of phoning in
the first 50 to get them done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm cutting and pasting images in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just the same images repeated,
but you're getting the full audio,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about the audio.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be some cool images, but it's all
about the audio.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first 21 videos are actually up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys would like to go to,
just go to YouTube and search for the Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually watch the first 21 or 22
videos and let me know what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you listen to those old episodes,
please tweet me and give me some critiques
[SPEAKER_00]: and opinions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to know what you think of those
old episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tweet me at GFYH Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear your opinions of the
old stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people aren't into Twitter and
social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to contact me and let me
know what you think, you can send me an
[SPEAKER_00]: email at growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And speaking of emails, that brings me to
the topic of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I received an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of long, but it brought up so
many good questions that I could not
[SPEAKER_00]: ignore it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to take a fat dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might take three or four dabs to tell
you the honest truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I think I'm going to take a dab
of this solventless hash that my buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: Chandler gave me for my birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, thanks for the solventless.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a fat dab of it right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll probably take a dab of
Summer Rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll probably take a dab of
Cactus Cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll probably finish off with a
dab of Cascade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to come back and we
will read an email from our friend who
[SPEAKER_00]: calls himself the Tri-County Bandit from
Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcast World, I am back and I have a
confession to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could not take all four of the dabs I
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a dab of that solventless that
Chandler gave me and I got super high and
[SPEAKER_00]: I coughed for like three minutes and I had
to go blow my nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I thought I'd be cool to take a
dab of that Cactus Cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went in a little deeper than I
thought I went in and I had to blow my
[SPEAKER_00]: nose again and cough for like six or seven
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the past 10 minutes of my life had just
been me taking two dabs and coughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am back and I'm going to shake off
this fucking dab coma I just put myself
into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to read an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pulling up the email right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This email, as mentioned before,
it comes from a guy who calls himself the
[SPEAKER_00]: Tri-County Bandit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've read his emails on the show before.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, this dude's emails get long and
they get very wordy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can't ignore it because there are
some golden nuggets hidden in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the questions that he asks are
great for this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to drop down the music and
we're going to read the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, if you want to send me an
email, let's grow from your heart at
[SPEAKER_00]: hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just felt like a cheesy eighties DJ as I
turned down the music and said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, you guys, here goes an email from
our friend, the Tri-County Bandit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, what a homie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your boy Tri-County Bandit from
Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a while since I last emailed
you, but I've been steadily digesting them
[SPEAKER_00]: shows as you release them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the good work, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your dedication is admirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he goes on to say, the only thing
I can say I've been steadily doing for
[SPEAKER_00]: years is eating, breathing and brushing my
teeth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, man, I'm hitting you up to say,
thanks for all the shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a lawn and ornamental pest control
technician here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love listening to podcasts,
especially Kana related ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get me through the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that being said, don't stop making
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I'll do my best to not stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am at 185 episodes and I have got a list
of podcasts that I want to record.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep promising you guys the episode
about building a drip system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel that that one's crucial to
get out right away, but I've got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the first page now when I opened
the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the other episodes have been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pages have been torn out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's the first one I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the building an auto watering drip
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got more episodes about how to
identify and take care of pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do thrips next on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to talk about like,
how to identify light leaks and pH
[SPEAKER_00]: problems and overfed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a whole bunch more content coming
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus I need to get the dabbing granny and
white Mike on a podcast together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have never sat down and done a show
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of stuff coming up,
so I'm not going to stop making podcasts
[SPEAKER_00]: for a really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I can pretty much promise you unless
something terrible happens and I will
[SPEAKER_00]: still work through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, the email goes on and says,
you always say that your fan base listens
[SPEAKER_00]: to about 30 to 45 minute shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my response to that is they ain't
real fans, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in it for the long haul.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not everybody can be in it for the
long haul, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not out there killing bugs for
eight hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have ADD and they don't listen
to a long podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer a long podcast myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I go to the grow, the big grow,
I'm there from six in the morning or seven
[SPEAKER_00]: in the morning till six at night usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm there for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like yourself, I like to put in a
podcast, hit play, and then not have to
[SPEAKER_00]: reach back into my pocket for another two
hours to hit play again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I listen to stuff like Joe
Rogan because he's on for three or four
[SPEAKER_00]: hours just fucking rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Joey Diaz because he's on for quite
a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the Steve Simone, Good Times
podcast because that one's long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Doug Stanhope because they're just
ridiculous and that one's kind of long,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Longer episodes are cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I've been trying to put out
longer episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's just me, 30 or 45 minutes is
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even listen to myself for much
longer than that, but thank you for the
[SPEAKER_00]: compliment and for wanting more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me feel great that people want
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better to know that people want more
than hearing that people are fucking sick
[SPEAKER_00]: of me and they're like, dude, shut up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather hear people say,
give me more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email keeps going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says like this, I listened to four hour
plus shows on my phone because I got to
[SPEAKER_00]: kill eight hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not saying you got to make longer shows,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just letting you know people are digging
the content and don't ever sell yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: short.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's selling myself short
that people listen to 36 minutes of a
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just what statistics on my end
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what ADD shows me, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people are probably driving to work
or something when they listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody's got a job like us where
they could put on the earbuds and listen
[SPEAKER_00]: for eight hours at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it when the day goes by so quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go into work, check out the to-do list,
figure out what do I got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get set up for a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once everybody kind of goes their
separate ways, I throw in earbuds and I
[SPEAKER_00]: hit play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, by the time it's break time,
that podcast is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, yes, time just traveled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so sweet, but I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a grow question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you also said, no homo, bro,
but I love your attitude and personality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I lived close by because I would
definitely smoke you out, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, I would love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would probably dab you out and get you
so high that you'd had to crash on my
[SPEAKER_00]: couch for a couple of minutes because a
lot of times that happens here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you go on to say, okay, onto my grow
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry for the long email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I warned everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're cool, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting used to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like the second or third email of
yours I've read on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting used to your longness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go like this, just added a little
walk-in AC to my grow and wanted to know
[SPEAKER_00]: how cold is too cold before I start seeing
slowdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just so used to 90 to a hundred
degrees all day, every day in outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: Florida weather, that when I go into a 70
to 75 degree grow, it just seems
[SPEAKER_00]: unnatural.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I don't want my indoor grow at 90
or a hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just observing what works in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had a grow this hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also see that increased temps decrease
THC or degrades it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also caused the smell to kind of
dwindle off.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do them outdoor guys pull it off?
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on to say, maybe Colorado is
different because it's cold most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: time, but does that mean all outdoor comes
out looking like regs?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's gotta be a way to keep all that
goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think of them Afghani plants on the
mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get little newts, heavy sun and
barely water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then again, I never smoked that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably whack.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit's probably dirty and the
genetics are gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Explain this to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we always say that environment is
key.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more to the email, but I kind of
want to stop here and talk about some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the questions you've asked and things that
you have said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first actual question you asked was
how cold can you get your grow room before
[SPEAKER_00]: you start seeing slowed growth or
problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: During the day, I would try to keep it
around 74 at the lowest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to go, you can go up to like 84,
80 at the highest, but I try to hover
[SPEAKER_00]: around 77 is where I keep my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think things go very well at 77
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get them down to the 69 ish if you
really want to, but there's no need for
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: 65 will really start slowing down the
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the night, you can get down to like
65.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I would really pay attention to,
don't have a huge change in temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: from day to night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have more than a 10 degree
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if during the day, your grow is getting
to 75, 77 at night, try not to get lower
[SPEAKER_00]: than 65 or 67 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep a 10 degree fluctuation and no more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any more of a change like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you will really be promoting powdery
mildew growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also it'll kind of shock and freak the
plants out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get down during the day to like
the low 70s at night, the low to mid 60s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wouldn't really go any cooler than
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned in this email that when you
go into your 70 to 75 degree grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: it just seems unnatural since you're so
used to growing your plants in a 90 to 100
[SPEAKER_00]: degree environment outdoors in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's understandable, but this plant,
the cannabis plant is an amazing plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: it loves to adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is a very adaptable plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your message, you start talking about
how you see the increased temps,
[SPEAKER_00]: decreased THC or degrade it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also kind of causes the smell to
dwindle off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you ask about how them outdoor guys
pull it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you mentioned that maybe in Colorado
it's different because it's cold most of
[SPEAKER_00]: the time, but that is not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a misconception.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado gets hot as shit during the
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the outdoor commercial grows are
in Pueblo, Colorado, where I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what is known as the desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it's called the high desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at the base of the mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not up in the hills.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets really hot here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen like 106.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that doesn't sound super hot to
you guys in Florida because it's a super
[SPEAKER_00]: dry heat here, but it gets really hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that dry heat just sucks all of the
moisture out of your skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down south, when it gets hot, there's
water in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your hair gets fluffy, your skin gets
weird and all your clothes feel damp.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado, when it gets hot,
it is dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like all of your moisture in your
body just evaporated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like you're touching the sun
because you're up so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does get hot here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be confused and think that it's cold
here all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have some crazy temperature swings
during the end of growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be really warm outside during the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at night it'll be really,
really cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll almost snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it'll be warm to where you can
wear shorts during the day the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it will almost snow the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see some huge swings, but it's not
always cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let me get back on track with the
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you mention increased temps,
ruined THC and it ruins the smell,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is more likely in an indoor grow
environment because the bulbs create heat
[SPEAKER_00]: that is really close to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's the sunshine and it's just
environmental heat, the plants can kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust because they're outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature outdoors is king.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of a nature versus nurture sort
of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoors, yeah, it's a hundred degrees,
but they're getting as much fresh air as
[SPEAKER_00]: they can possibly handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots, if you've got them in the dirt,
in the ground, they can stretch out really
[SPEAKER_00]: far and find the nutrients and find the
fresh air and find the water that the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots may need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoors, you can give them everything that
they need and everything that you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: give them, but you're only able to supply
so much air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can only give them so much oxygen,
so much CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can only get so much root space.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are only so many things you can
control indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, the sun is the king.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have so many issues with the
cannabis plant and put it under the sun
[SPEAKER_00]: because the sun is so powerful that it
will give that plant the strength and
[SPEAKER_00]: energy to fix whatever problem it's got.
[SPEAKER_00]: A grow bulb just doesn't have the magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grow bulb does not have the magic that
the sun has.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot duplicate that nature magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me loop back around because I did get
a little sidetracked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the heat from the bulbs and the stale
air from a grow room will contribute to
[SPEAKER_00]: the loss of terpenes and the loss of
potency because you've got bulbs too close
[SPEAKER_00]: to buds, and those lights are just beating
heat and beating lumens and beating par
[SPEAKER_00]: watts down onto the trichomes and onto the
terpenoids, and it's just destroying them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't happen as much outdoors,
but you do get dirt and you do get rain
[SPEAKER_00]: and you do get wind, so you've got those
things to deal with also.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the email, you ask, how do them outdoor
guys in Colorado pull it off?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they pull it off with a lot of hard
work and dedication?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the people sleep at the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sleep onsite where the plants are so
that they can wake up as soon as the sun
[SPEAKER_00]: comes up and they work until the sun goes
down, and then there are actually people
[SPEAKER_00]: that are in charge of checking on the
plants at night in case some shit goes on
[SPEAKER_00]: weather-wise or intruder-wise or
animal-wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a 24-hour job, and it's dedication.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how they do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go on to talk about imagining this
Afghan Kush plant on the side of a
[SPEAKER_00]: mountain, getting little newts,
heavy sun, and barely any water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, that's probably some of the best
cannabis on the planet because that plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: it grew there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably got seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably males and females there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant grew there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It developed seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It dropped seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it remembered that last year it got
beat to shit by wind, that it didn't get
[SPEAKER_00]: enough water, and it got way too much sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds that come out of that are going
to remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phenotypes that thrive in that
environment are going to survive,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're going to breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phenotypes that don't thrive in that
environment will die off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's survival of the fittest out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shit that has been growing and
breeding itself, that land race that's
[SPEAKER_00]: been happening out there on whatever
imaginary hillside we're both talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about in Afghanistan that nobody can ever
find because it's so hard to get to,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the best fucking weed ever grows
there, and nobody even knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one ever smokes it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just keeps growing and breeding itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably some of the best dankest
shit on the planet because it's adjusted
[SPEAKER_00]: to that environment, and it's in the most
desirable environment for what it is
[SPEAKER_00]: adjusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's adjusted itself through breeding,
through evolution, through selection,
[SPEAKER_00]: through natural selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably pretty dank weed just
through nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a lot of the time people get
in the way of the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the times people are like,
dude, what do I need to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I need to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something wrong with my plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best thing I can tell them to do is
just leave it alone for a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've done everything to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs a fucking break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: This email says, these plants grow on the
side of a rocky mountain where nobody is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to joke that it got pissed on by a
goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got blown over by the wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lives a rough life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just leave it alone and let it do its
thing, and sometimes that's the best for a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like I'm super rambly,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a lot of Dr. Pepper and a bunch
of sativa dabs, and I apologize if I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: just rambling my ass off through this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to hit pause, and I'm going to
do that thing where I take dabs and drink
[SPEAKER_00]: and choke, and then hopefully that calms
me down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I am back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a couple of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drank some water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm more calm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm zen and ready to do a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back into this email.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did skip a couple of paragraphs because
there was some chitter chatter and some
[SPEAKER_00]: personal stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he gets into this part right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, can you speak on the differences
between cuts and phenotypes?
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, it sounds like if you give me a
cut of what you got in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will form and express itself a little
differently at my place here in Florida
[SPEAKER_00]: due to the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I gave that clone back to you in
several years, would it be the same?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would it revert back to what you had?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, does that mean that each strain has
endless phenotypes?
[SPEAKER_00]: I always thought that a phenotype was if
you pop 10 beans, all 10 of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: each one will express themselves in a
little different, showing itself to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific phenome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to stop right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to the question,
but I want to stop right there and catch
[SPEAKER_00]: up with some answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, if I gave you a clone of one of my
favorite plants that I've got here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado that I've been growing for
several years and you took it to Florida,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would grow a little bit differently if
you grew it indoors or outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would not have to take it all the way
to Florida if we were doing this in indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you set up an indoor grow room,
you could probably do it in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: building.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say we both rented a warehouse
somewhere in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going hypothetical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm throwing darts at maps here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've rented a warehouse together in
Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are co-partners on this warehouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a giant rectangle building.
[SPEAKER_00]: We draw a line down the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put a wall up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we've got two squares.
[SPEAKER_00]: You own one side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I own the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I build a grow my way on one side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You build a grow your way on the other
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut two clones of Grateful Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give you a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We both grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We veg for the same amount of time and we
flower for the same amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our plants are going to look different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very minor details are going to make your
plants look different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like nutrients will make your
plants look different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently switched from botanic hair to
veg bloom powder nutrients and my plants
[SPEAKER_00]: look completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm seeing colors I've never seen from
these plants before.
[SPEAKER_00]: My Grateful Dog plants are coming out a
really light purple color.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used to come out like a dark,
I don't know, like a real dark,
[SPEAKER_00]: dark purple and now they're like a real
light lavender.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really pretty purple that I've
never seen from these plants before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the nutrients are making a difference
in phenotypical expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperatures will make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your grow is a little colder or mine's
a little warmer, it will make a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humidity could make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light spectrum could make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing with high pressure
sodium lamps and I'm growing with LEDs,
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe we're growing with the exact same
lights and yours were three inches closer
[SPEAKER_00]: than mine, you're going to see a little
bit of a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just very small things like that are going
to make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of what plays into that is the
stability of the plant and that goes into
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on which parents were selected
and it also depends on which generation
[SPEAKER_00]: you are working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're working with the F1,
the F2, maybe up to the F5, the F5 is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be a little more stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, if it was selected and bred
properly, the F5 will show less variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That F1 may show more variation depending
on the stability of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, you will see variation if you took
a plant to Florida and grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say we did this outdoors just to
make it a little more intense because our
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor environment here in Colorado is a
little, we're very much like Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're rocky, we're in the mountains,
we have drastic temperature swings,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got hot, we've got cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then if you took a plant that's been
growing outdoors and then you took that to
[SPEAKER_00]: Florida, the leaves will look differently
because there's much more humidity there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that the leaves will get a
little bit thinner where the humidity is
[SPEAKER_00]: and they will get a little bit thicker
where it lacks humidity because those
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves are trying to catch humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a dry area, they will get bigger
because they're trying to find more
[SPEAKER_00]: surface to catch more moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a humid area, they're going to get
smaller because they're getting plenty of
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you see sativa plants that are
grown in tropical areas have those skinny
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's why indica plants have
those big wide fat leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of their purpose is to gather
moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking for moisture from the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking for humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may see that difference in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you take a clone of that plant
before it flowers and you keep it and you
[SPEAKER_00]: drive it to Colorado and you give it back
to me and I grow that out, I will probably
[SPEAKER_00]: see the change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's several years, even if it's
the same season, I'll probably see a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of a difference because these
plants are such quick adapters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're little soldiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will adapt in one season.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant is only expected to live one
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to happen in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to veg through the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time fall comes, it's supposed to
be flowering and when the winter hits,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's supposed to be gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to have dropped seeds in the
ground so that it can do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it only gets a year and these plants
adapt very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to get myself back on track
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the email you asked, does this mean
that plants have unlimited phenotypes?
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of fucked with my head because I
didn't know the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, well, they're kind of because
it's based on environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I thought I should Google the
word phenotype to give myself a more clear
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the actual definition from Google,
this is where I found it is Google.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the set of observable
characteristics of an individual resulting
[SPEAKER_00]: from the interaction of its genotype with
the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that brought me to this conclusion and
I actually recorded two or three other
[SPEAKER_00]: pieces and I had to back up and delete it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there are not unlimited phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are unlimited environments and that
phenotype will express itself differently
[SPEAKER_00]: in different environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that took me a lot of rambling to get
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why doing a phenohunt for yourself
with a pack of seeds is so important
[SPEAKER_00]: because you'll find the phenotype that
grows in your grow environment that works
[SPEAKER_00]: the best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to do an episode pretty soon
about expectations from a seed pack
[SPEAKER_00]: because I've been talking to a few people
about seeds and seed sales and there is
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely a podcast due for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I want to get back into the
email so we can wrap this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has another question in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, I always thought that a pheno was
if you pop 10 beans and all 10 pop that
[SPEAKER_00]: each one will express themselves a little
differently, showing it to be a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like let's say Gorilla Glue 4 for
instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you have it and it's available
in seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I pop a 10 pack and find that Gorilla
Glue number 4 or is that a pheno based on
[SPEAKER_00]: some guy's environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, would a Colorado Gorilla Glue 4
be the same if you gave it to me here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Florida?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he says, you get me?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he ends with, sorry, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, for the confusion and long
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can respond via email or show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, bro, here I am responding on the
show and I'm going to answer the last part
[SPEAKER_00]: of that question for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did get a 10 pack of seeds and the
breeding was done properly, yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should be able to find a very similar
phenotype to what the breeder has labeled
[SPEAKER_00]: as the Gorilla Glue number 4.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably not going to happen with
Gorilla Glue 4 because it was accidentally
[SPEAKER_00]: bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't done on purpose, but let's talk
about a strain that I've bred that I can
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about that I know what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Firefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Firefly is a strain that I made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Firefly is lemon skunk to a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Firefly has got three, you know,
honestly, most strains are going to show
[SPEAKER_00]: approximately three to five basic
phenotypes in the F1 through F2,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe F3 generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get one that looks like
the mommy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get one that looks like
the daddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to find a phenotype that is
right in the middle of those that shows
[SPEAKER_00]: both parents equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to get one that's fucked
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to get one that's
kind of like amazing and stellar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either going to taste really good or
it's going to have a lot of resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be something standout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually you'll find the one of those that
you want and you'll breed to it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to get two or three
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get one that looks like
mommy, one that looks like daddy,
[SPEAKER_00]: and one that's the perfect cross of the
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you keep breeding, you can narrow
it down to where they all come out as the
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect mix or they all look like mommy or
they all look like daddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal is usually to make that perfect
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually see traits in a male plant and I
see traits in a female plant and I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, if I put those two traits together,
I can make one bad motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's usually what inspires my
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm getting at is you should be
able to find, if you crack a pack of my
[SPEAKER_00]: Firefly, you should be able to find the
phenotype that I have been posting
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Firefly has three very distinct phenotypes
that I can identify early in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you cracked a pack of 10 seeds and
you flowered them, by the end of flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will find one that looks just like the
Firefly I have been posting pictures of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since Firefly is not a clone only,
GorillaGlue4 is clone only, he called it
[SPEAKER_00]: GorillaGlue4.
[SPEAKER_00]: I assume he had an amount of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were at least four, maybe he had 10
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And GorillaGlue4 was the one that stuck
around because it was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: He probably got rid of all the others and
it was probably labeled GorillaGlue4 on a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone or on a bag and that just stuck
forever, it didn't lose the four,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was just GorillaGlue.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also number seven now that I think
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there had to be at least seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm guessing there were probably 10 or 15
that he cracked, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So GorillaGlue4 and GorillaGlue7 were the
two desirable phenotypes that he found.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the differences are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only grown the number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fun to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grew huge chunky ass buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once again, I'm getting rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, if you do crack a 10 pack,
you should be able to find something if
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds were bred properly, even if your
grow room's a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully your grow room is within a
certain temperature range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you've got a certain humidity
range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you're running a certain amount
of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's keeping us all uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the growers are hopefully within those
certain parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants are gonna show basically the
same phenotypical expressions indoors if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're running appropriate environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoors, you may see some things
differently, but outdoors is a whole new
[SPEAKER_00]: ball game.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing a phenohunt and if you're
looking for things like that, that's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably happening indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your phenohunt indoors, find the
keeper, run that keeper outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I would do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess that was the long way of saying
since we are all running very similar grow
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms, yes, you should be able to find
something very similar to the known,
[SPEAKER_00]: the GorillaGlue4, or what I'm calling the
bud in the picture phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if all you've got to go by is a
picture, how do you know if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: actually getting one that smells,
tastes, smokes, has the potency?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is actually the representation of
whatever strain GorillaGlue4, Firefly,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do you know it's the one that you
want?
[SPEAKER_00]: What I recommend is growing out a pack of
seeds and finding the one that grows best
[SPEAKER_00]: in your environment, smokes best for you,
works best medically if it's a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: product, works best recreationally if it's
a recreational product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the one that's ideal for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what a phenohunt's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to get something that's
known like that, try to get the clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are plenty of ways to get clone-only
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing I've noticed about a lot of
these strains is they're all hype that
[SPEAKER_00]: lasts for just a little while until the
next hype strain comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a minute there, it was the Girl Scout
Cookies, and then it was the GorillaGlue4,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it was Tangy, and then it was
some Sherbert, and who knows what it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be next week, but it just changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Skittles for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't worry too much about a hype
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry too much about what you read.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a good pack of seeds if that's what
you need to do, and run them and find the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype that works best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I hope I was able to answer
your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a long, rambly email,
and it made me become long and rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have more questions, make sure you
send them to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is
