[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all the advertising I've got for
you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by letting you know what I am smoking on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've smoked a little bit of
everything over the past weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked a joint with dabs inside of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked every kind of concentrate I could
imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you might be able to hear it in my
voice, but it was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today let's talk about what I've got
in my hand right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some white lightning number seven
sauce from our friends at oleo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is oleo sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm cracking it open.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like banana runs like the banana
shaped candies that you get out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: little quarter thing at the bowling alley
or wherever you get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like banana runs with another
sweetness on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe maybe a hint of lemon maybe on top
of the banana run to lemony banana run
[SPEAKER_00]: this concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one good crystal left in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again with oleo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciated the amount of sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is the turps to crystals,
which is the high cannabinoid full
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ratio was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 30% turps, 70% chunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to dab that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a pain in the ass to get on the
dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel like I'm wasting a lot of the
juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great concentrate from our friends at
oleo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The white lightning number seven sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of tastes like banana runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're into banana, that's a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not into banana, this might not
be the thing for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to our friends at oleo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I said I've been smoking a little
bit of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to an event called the Dude Grows
Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you a little bit about what
the Dude Grows Cup is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another podcast hosted by my
friends, the Dude and Scotty Real.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: They threw an amazing event this weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, the Dude Grows Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dude Grows Show is the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the name of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dude and Scotty Real are the hosts and
co-hosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guru is the producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple other cats that are on
quite frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always going to miss names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel bad because I'm a pothead and I
forget names, but shout out everybody from
[SPEAKER_00]: the Dude Grows Show and the Dude Grows
crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these guys on the Dude Grows podcast
decided that they're going to throw a cup
[SPEAKER_00]: and this year was their third cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've got some experience and they're
getting really good at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a great event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers grow flowers, their pot,
and they enter their pot into this cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a bunch of folks were invited,
myself and a lot of other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a good head count on how many
people were in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was at a place called Cultivated
Synergy and it was perfectly crowded.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was crowded enough to look like a big
crowd, but not so overcrowded that you
[SPEAKER_00]: were shoulder to shoulder bumping into
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, a bunch of people came.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that grew their product came.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were at least 30, maybe 40 entries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way it worked, these people grew
their product and they entered them,
[SPEAKER_00]: they turned them in, in a jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these jars were all lined up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lined up across a, I would call it a
bud bar in one section of the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: The back wall of the building just had a
long bud bar set up and there were bud
[SPEAKER_00]: tenders behind that bar packing bowls for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you walked up and you said,
hey, can I try sample number one?
[SPEAKER_00]: The person behind that bud bar would pack
up a bowl of sample number one for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just a small oney bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a bunch of fresh pipes laying
around and people had pipes for days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just walk up and say, hey,
can I get a fresh sample of number one?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'd pack up number one for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take a little hit of it, see what you
think of it and blow it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then get back in line and go try sample
number two and then get back in line and
[SPEAKER_00]: do sample number three and just work your
way down the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were 30 to 40 samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you wanted to smoke all of them,
you were gonna be there for a little while
[SPEAKER_00]: because you had to stand in line between
each one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also you wanna take a second between
each puff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't wanna smoke sample one,
smoke sample two.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you gonna tell what happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sample two is gonna be the only one you
notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, maybe sample one's all you notice,
but you didn't know because it was sample
[SPEAKER_00]: two.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you gotta take a minute anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were all lined up.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were, you take a smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once you smoke all of the samples you
wanna try, then it was time to vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they gave us tokens that said the dude
grows cup on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were just little wooden tokens
and you would place those in the
[SPEAKER_00]: corresponding jar numbered to which sample
you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you like sample number one or number
23 or whatever, you would go ahead and
[SPEAKER_00]: throw your little token, your coin into
jar number one or jar number 23 to show
[SPEAKER_00]: that you had voted for that strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were given three, four or five
tokens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember how many tokens there
were, but yeah, you were given tokens to
[SPEAKER_00]: vote with, that's how you voted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they just went through and
counted how many votes there were for each
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they did announce the winners at
the end of the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the list of winners right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: First place at the dude grows cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what they grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have the names.
[SPEAKER_00]: First place, or should I start at the
bottom?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start at fourth place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost fucked that one up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fourth place, you guys, was a friend of
mine, was a friend of the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: was a friend of the dude grows crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fourth place was a very respectable,
very honorable, very polite, very friendly
[SPEAKER_00]: young dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend Moby Dill won fourth place at
the dude grows cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I cannot remember the name of his
entry.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you'll hear this jar pop open.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a little sample of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave me a nice size nugget.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's lemon G crossed to something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he either called it Colorado pucker or
lemon pucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say he called it Colorado pucker
and it's lemon G crossed to something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can certainly see the ugly lemon G
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not dissing your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon G is ugly to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did a hell of a good job of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the way this bud is shaped is
obviously lemon G and it smells to high
[SPEAKER_00]: hell of lemon G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greasy lemon funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm just I just keep smelling it over
and over.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I opened the jar, it kind of
punched me in the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: This whole house is going to smell like
that lemon turp for quite a while now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moby Dill, much respect, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fourth place.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that is fourth place, I can only
imagine what first place smelled and
[SPEAKER_00]: tastes like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have tried it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, we're going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, third place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third place was an entry by a person named
Jaren.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Jaren.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second place was a person who called
themselves Gwen Green Thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Gwen Green Thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then first place winner at the Dude
Grows Cup was a person who called
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves Binsky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've actually heard a lot about Binsky
going around the industry lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a name that people are saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Binsky for being first
place with the flower competition at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about the cup a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you who won.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you how it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: People grew flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They entered flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoked flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We voted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They announced a winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically how a cup should go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went smoothly in that aspect without a
hitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing went wrong, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got super lucky and found a really nice
parking space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, that could have been kind of a
pain in the ass because I had a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff to carry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nothing went really wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing was poorly planned this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everything went fairly well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So man, I had a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite parts about it is there
were two or three different podcasts
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it is a Dude Grows event.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hosted by the Dude Grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: They invite me, the Grow From Your Heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go up there and hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also I met a couple other folks
that have podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly am going to forget a lot of
people that I want to give shout outs to
[SPEAKER_00]: because I got super lit and I had a super
good time and I didn't write down names
[SPEAKER_00]: and shit, but I'll try to do my best to
remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my favorite part is that all these
people get together.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these podcasters come together and we
just all hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to meet people that listen to the
Dude Grows show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to meet people that listen to my
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to meet people that found the Dude
show through my show and people that found
[SPEAKER_00]: my show through the Dude show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just such a good time to get the
community together.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that message me on social media and
through email and however they contact me,
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly social media, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to meet them and actually shake
their hand and give them too big of a dab
[SPEAKER_00]: and watch them turn pale and try not to
fall over because they're not from
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado and they don't get to dab like
that and I'm spoiled and I like to spoil
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I love about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we get people from all over the
country and a lot of the events are a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of younger kids and the music's too
loud and it's a little obnoxious and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly like a trade show, like an RV show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's just trying to sell shit and
their way of selling you shit is by having
[SPEAKER_00]: hot girls and loud music.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't happen at the Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are plenty of beautiful ladies
there, but they are not vending anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just there hanging out,
smoking dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're there part of the crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not there for advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: The music is at a very acceptable level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: My throat's only burnt out because I chose
to talk way too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never stopped talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met so many cool people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the other events,
the music's so loud that when I come home,
[SPEAKER_00]: my throat hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The music is at a great level.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little bit of an older crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the super young crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the next level up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of enjoy that aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any worries leaving my
backpack sitting on the table and turning
[SPEAKER_00]: my head a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel like someone's gonna rob me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a great event.
[SPEAKER_00]: The venue is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivated Synergy is great at hosting
events like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Cultivated Synergy for taking
good care of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoyed the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to meet a lot of my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to meet, so one of our friends
actually, there was a huge snowstorm east
[SPEAKER_00]: of here right before the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our friend, I'm not sure if he wants
his name said, but one of our friends was
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to come in and he got snowed in and
had to post pictures of himself stuck at a
[SPEAKER_00]: hotel saying, I'm gonna miss the Dude
Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the community felt bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like, fuck, dude, that sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's messaging like, man,
we hope to see you there, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, hopefully you figured out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I met the Dude Grows Cup and this
big guy walks up and introduces himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, what's up, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, bro, I thought you were
snowed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, dude, we saw cars going on
the highway and we got in the fucking car,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they got to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a bunch of my friends got to make it to
the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of people that I see on the
Instagram live feeds made it to the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of people I messaged with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really cool to shake a bunch of
their hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to leave anybody out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to say a whole bunch of
names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to give a huge shout out to
the Dude and Scotty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, thank you guys for inviting me to
the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your event is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, if you can go to the
Dude Grows Cup next year, it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite you come take some dabs with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens a lot of times is I get
messages on Sunday saying, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro, I saw you last night at the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: You looked busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm there chit chatting and bullshit and
taking dabs with my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in say, what's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to put in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do want to put in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be polite and say, hey, I'm going to
interrupt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to meet Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to dab with Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shake my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't feel bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get super lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone else is super lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The conversations just come and go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll say one sentence and then your
attention drifts off to the next
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You try to keep up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come say what's up to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be your friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to meet you also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love the interaction, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great meeting a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even remember what the fuck I was
saying, but I do want to talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: About something that I did enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never caught the young man's name.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a guy sitting across from me at
this little bar area and we're taking some
[SPEAKER_00]: dabs and he pulled out some bordello
shatter and some clementine shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been growing bordello at three rivers
for quite a while and we've made some
[SPEAKER_00]: shatter out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a couple other companies make
shatter for us and it's come out pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this dude made some fucking bordello
shatter that brought out the sweetness to
[SPEAKER_00]: the bordello.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this undertone of sweetness and he
brought it out so nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dude, whoever made that bordello
extract, if that is you, good job,
[SPEAKER_00]: my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff was delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might have been the first or second dab
I took when I got there and I was carrying
[SPEAKER_00]: my bag and I'd been parking and I'd been
driving for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you run into an event and you see
everybody, it's tense for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, should I just want to put
down my bag and relax?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put down my bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put down my bag and my cooler and I got
chilled out and I was kicking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I took that dab and that just put me
in like chill, like, all right,
[SPEAKER_00]: now it's time to be at the dude bros cup
mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything was just, just chilled out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to the dude with the bordello
shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never caught your name, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the great dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Message me if you hear this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know who you are and maybe we can
meet up and take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to try some more of that
bordello.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, if you can attend
the dude gross cup, I highly encourage you
[SPEAKER_00]: to do that next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, make sure you go check out all the
samples, make sure you vote, make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got super lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I walked in, I met up with some
friends and hung out in one area for a
[SPEAKER_00]: little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took a bunch of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I realized there was a bunch of space
at that little bar area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went over there, set up my dad area and
I just hung out and met a bunch of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, then they wanted to do the prize
giveaway at that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when I drifted off to another
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when they did the awards.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, they gave away so many prizes
that night.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had raffle tickets, if you got in
on the raffle, you were able to win so
[SPEAKER_00]: many cool prizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go next year, get in on the raffle
because you will win something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people leave early that all the
people that stick around, that's who wins
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stick around, win some cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was gifted some cannabis, a friend of
mine who I cannot remember their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, it was a cannabis event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a traumatic brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met a lot of goddamn people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was gifted some flowers called star
fucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you gave me the star fucker flowers,
you're my new fucking hero.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shit smells so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can smell, I don't know the cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's some star dog in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's called star fucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's star dog in there for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can smell the star dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either star killer or star dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like star dog to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the cross is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good fucking job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoever grew this weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, it's called the star fucker and
it is Rasta Jeff approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely like that weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like star dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got great green and bright orange
colors to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it is the density gets, gets my
attention and the aroma is kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: old school weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like weed used to get in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little bit of chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little bit of skunk going on to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super delicious weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoever gave me that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty much my wrap up of the
dude grow show you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot to, uh, to highlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a bunch of great friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was there for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, definitely worth the drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely worth the ticket price.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go get there early because parking
in that area is kind of a bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got super lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody pulled out of a spot and I was
like, Oh man, you got to dive in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: be aggressive in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, yeah, go to the dude grows cup and
also listen to the dude grows podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wake and bake with the boys, roll up some
weed and get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think you should do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friends at the dude grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I shout out to all the people
that I met.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to all the people that I got to
hang out with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm not sure who wants their names
said or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to get anybody in trouble,
but I want to give you guys shout outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a fucking weird, weird level
there, weird boundary.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, my friend, uh, Matthew,
I'm not going to say your full name had a
[SPEAKER_00]: great time hanging out with you a whole
bunch to the Roach mangled remains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to forget anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to stop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys had a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to everybody that I hung out
with a shout out to my friends at new
[SPEAKER_00]: millennium for taking care of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super big shout out to, uh, El gringo de
Mota dude, that super lemon haze that your
[SPEAKER_00]: friend grew was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if you would have entered that you
probably would have had a good chance of
[SPEAKER_00]: winning.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff was super nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, you guys, that's enough names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to get anybody in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also don't want to forget anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to leave anybody out and feel
bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, shout out to all the people that
introduced themselves that walked up and
[SPEAKER_00]: shook my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to everybody who had good
conversation with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to everybody that I saw that I
dabbed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize that I'm no good with
remembering names.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I see your face, I'll remember you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will high five you.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing we need to do is get name tags.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to write, hi, my name is,
and you need to put your real name and
[SPEAKER_00]: your Instagram name on there because for
stoners and everybody's got two fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: names, that gets to be a lot to remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was talking to a friend on my
Instagram live video and I didn't even
[SPEAKER_00]: realize who I was talking to because I was
like, what's up Instagram handle seven 10
[SPEAKER_00]: 4 25,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just talking to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he's some random dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he's asking questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just like kind of being kind of
vague.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause what he was asking was I should be
vague about that if I didn't know the guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so eventually he's like, Hey,
you know that it's me, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he told me his real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, Oh fuck dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even realize that was you because
it's hard to keep up with all the
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram names and real names.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one thing that I would add those
little, hi, my name is, uh, I would have
[SPEAKER_00]: those tags with your real name and then
your Instagram name or whatever you're
[SPEAKER_00]: known as or whatever your company is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mine would say, hi, I'm Rasta Jeff and
I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the people would be like, that is Rasta
Jeff, just so there's no question,
[SPEAKER_00]: just so you guys can't say, I wasn't sure
if that was you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys I'm six five and I have
dreadlocks on a more than a grow from your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart podcast t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking Graham down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty easy to spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one more quick thing I want to
talk about before I start wrapping up this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me find this little screenshot that I
took.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought this was entertaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work for a Colorado marijuana
enforcement division, regulated business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's see who published this document.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the med.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Colorado marijuana enforcement
division has passed out a, the criminal
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement division from the department
of revenue is where this came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is part of the Colorado marijuana
enforcement division.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pass out a paper that says four 20
reminders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says four 20 reminders in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's like a bubble, um,
a bubble, a cluster chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember what they call these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you're supposed to get ideas in
school and you make a circle and you write
[SPEAKER_00]: podcasts and you make notes coming off it,
you make another circle and it says,
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another circle comes off and it says,
talk about education that they made one of
[SPEAKER_00]: these in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says reminders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to read you guys the
reminders that they have issued.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top one says no sales to non-patients
and persons under 21 years of age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most vertical IDs equal under 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that means is no sales to
non-patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a medical marijuana dispenser,
you cannot sell, sell to anybody who is
[SPEAKER_00]: not a registered patient with a current
active card and valid ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and persons under the age of 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a recreational store,
you were able to sell to anyone with a 21
[SPEAKER_00]: and up ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're not 21 and up, you cannot sell
to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also give you a hint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most vertical IDs equal under 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a vertical ID,
the vertical goes the long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That probably means that you are a minor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are not buying cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another bubble and it says no
public consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is violation of state and local laws
and person could be subject to criminal
[SPEAKER_00]: charges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're just reminding you for 420 to
remind your customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: No public consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one says visitors and limited
access areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visitors must be escorted by employee five
per employee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I thought was four.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you're going to take people that
are not badged and not employees into a
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation facility, they must be
escorted by a key badged employee.
[SPEAKER_00]: You must have a key badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have a support badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have a key badge or an owner
badge, and you have to escort those people
[SPEAKER_00]: through the facility and you cannot do
more than five people at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to bring a band
through, if you're going to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: fortunate youth loves to go through grows,
I think there's like five or six of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could bring five of them per person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to have two people to have the
full band going through there,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably to escort them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if a rapper comes through,
Wiz Khalifa comes through by himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: One person can escort Wiz just one on one,
but you have to have one person for every
[SPEAKER_00]: five visitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one person has to be a key badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't have to worry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just telling you the weird things that
the MED is reminding us of that's because
[SPEAKER_00]: people come from out of town.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know that celebrities are going to
fly into Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oftentimes when that happens,
you see pictures of said celebrities on
[SPEAKER_00]: social media and grows in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the girls, if you've been to
a few of them, you can recognize them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I can scroll through and be like,
Oh, that's that grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just cause I've seen them a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know who does what.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the MED sees that and they're like,
Oh, look, this bunch of rappers is in this
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's one guy with the badge and they
can see that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful if you're doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you have a, this is not on the
paper, but if you have visitors in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't let them touch product and don't
post pictures of people touching product
[SPEAKER_00]: because visitors cannot touch product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to continue with the bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next bubble says no free product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot give away marijuana or
marijuana product to a consumer for any
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means no free shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: No free.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't say buy two of these,
get one free.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can say buy two, get one for a penny,
but you can't do them for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are loopholes around everything,
but no free shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sales limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: One ounce of flour is equal to 80,
10 milligram servings and edibles or eight
[SPEAKER_00]: grams of concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are an out of state shopper,
or if you're shopping recreationally,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's just a recreational thing,
that's not a medical marijuana thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: One ounce of flowers is equal to 80,
10 milligrams serving edibles or eight
[SPEAKER_00]: grams of concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how they do the math on deciding
how much you are allowed to purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're coming from out of state and
you want to reach your limit, that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: conversion that you have to do to break it
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either get 80, 10 milligram
servings of edibles or eight grams of
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are your limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to continue on with the
little bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the red bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says no free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consumption on premises.
[SPEAKER_00]: A licensee shall not permit consumption of
MJ or MJ product on premises.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no marijuana consumption on site.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people think you can go to the
dispensary and smoke weed there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people think we're at the gross
smoking weed there.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you cannot smoke weed anywhere
regulated by the marijuana enforcement
[SPEAKER_00]: division.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is on camera from a thousand
different angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is nowhere I can go in that building
to pick my nose or scratch my ass that
[SPEAKER_00]: will not be on camera other than a
restroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every square inch of that facility is on
camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably from two angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want you on camera from two angles at
all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: That says hours of operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: No sales before or after 8 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: to 12 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: unless restricted further by local
jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the places around here I think are
forced to be done by nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the rule is I'm not certain on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't shop at a dispensary a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: To tell you the truth, guys, I only go to
one and it's in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're forced to close at nine o'clock in
Springs and they're medical only.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bubbles continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say check.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check ID must be valid government issued
ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can use your military ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use your normal state issued ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use your passport, but you have to
have a valid government issued ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cannot be expired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just says follow appropriate
requirements for advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not allowed to have sign spinners.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Product limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Centers can only have patient to ounce
allowance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a medical marijuana center,
the amount of product you're allowed to
[SPEAKER_00]: have on hand is based on how many people
are signed up for you as their provider
[SPEAKER_00]: for that facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're only allowed to have your
patient to ounce allowance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't overload because it's 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have extra inventory on stock
because you plan on running through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to have a driver at
your grow or wherever your product is
[SPEAKER_00]: stored, ready to transfer that product at
on demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever you run out of a jar or a few
pounds of something and you can take a
[SPEAKER_00]: five pound delivery, you got to have a guy
bring you more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't have extra on site just
because it's 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the last bubble says licensee may
refuse sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Example to a person who is impaired.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just reminding you that you've got
the right to refuse service to anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: should you so choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody walks into your dispensary and
you just don't feel right, you do have the
[SPEAKER_00]: right to refuse service to that person.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think they're a federal agent,
if you think their ID may be fake,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you think they're intoxicated,
if you just don't want to sell to them
[SPEAKER_00]: because it doesn't feel good in your
heart, you were allowed to say no.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a little bubble of a little
memo of bubbles sent out by the Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana Enforcement Division to all of
the businesses just to remind the
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses how to keep themselves out of
trouble for 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we did have one facility
experience some problems and they got
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're trying to help us out and make
sure that doesn't happen anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you enjoyed
