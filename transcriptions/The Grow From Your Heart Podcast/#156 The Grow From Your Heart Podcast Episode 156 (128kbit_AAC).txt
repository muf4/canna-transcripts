Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 156 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist, or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I want to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots band for letting me use their music
on my show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I had to pull myself
away from Narcos season two to come record
[SPEAKER_00]: a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my friend that threw down the
Netflix password for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I got me a fresh Netflix account
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catching up on some Narcos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't get enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to good old Pablo Escobar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, this episode,
I am going to talk about a recent,
[SPEAKER_00]: a season assist letter that was sent to
all of the cannabis social lounges in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get to that, I want to
answer some emails that were sent to us by
[SPEAKER_00]: some friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just get right to that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came to the Grow From Your Heart
Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one, I don't know if she wants me
to say her name on the air, but I am going
[SPEAKER_00]: to read her message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any opinion on trimming
machines?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are home growers, so we are looking for
something small like the Triminator mini
[SPEAKER_00]: dry trimmer or the smaller trim pal,
but lots of folks are against trimming
[SPEAKER_00]: machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just thought I would ask your expert
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all the info you share.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks for listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it when people send me
messages and I love it when people tell me
[SPEAKER_00]: that they love the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it all worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about trim machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to like my answer,
but there is not a trim machine that I
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a fan of hand-trimmed cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think connoisseur grade cannabis should
be trimmed by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing a whole bunch,
if you've got a large outdoor,
[SPEAKER_00]: I might see you using a trim machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, I can tell the difference
between hand-trimmed and machine-trimmed
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, and there's nothing like
hand-trimmed cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why grow your plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have them for what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine weeks in flower and then probably
four to six weeks, maybe eight weeks in
[SPEAKER_00]: veg, maybe longer, depending on how you do
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a lot of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 13 weeks, 14, 15, 16 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got these plants, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to cut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not take the time to trim them by hand
and love them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know it's tedious and it kind of
sucks sometimes, but it's so worth it in
[SPEAKER_00]: my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my big thing is when you use a
machine to trim your cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: it turns that trim into like a mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just makes it, it cuts it at too
many different angles, too many different
[SPEAKER_00]: times, and it makes it, it's basically a
mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you mow the lawn and you've got
that bag of clippings and it stinks real
[SPEAKER_00]: funky, you've kind of mulched up all of
your cannabis leaves and they're releasing
[SPEAKER_00]: too much moisture and it's starting to,
there's a reaction that's happening in
[SPEAKER_00]: there because it's cut so many times and
it's stacked inside of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know how the grass stinks real
bad?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, your trim will start to do that
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times when you're getting shitty
hash from the dispensary, it was possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: made, and I can't guarantee it,
but it was possibly made by material that
[SPEAKER_00]: came from the trim machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I helped my buddy Kevin get started
making his little hash company,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was an extract guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was giving him material.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used a trim machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used the kind that looks like a giant
salad bowl and it's got the grill in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of it and you put the top on it and
you spin it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It trimmed the shit out of some of my
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my buds had just mangled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew some kush that was like rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It trimmed that okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some lemon skunk that had some
fingery buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just cut the shit out of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't like that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where I'm getting is I gave the trim
from that to my buddy Kevbro and he ran
[SPEAKER_00]: and made hash out of it and the hash was
terrible and we couldn't figure out why.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we took it to Denver with us one time
on a trip and we showed a friend and my
[SPEAKER_00]: buddy's like, dude, did you use a trim
machine to make this hash?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he called us out right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it made green shitty hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one major reason why I don't
like a trim machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it should be trimmed by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can trim it by hand and then you can
use all of your fine trim to actually make
[SPEAKER_00]: some product out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do whatever you want with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you use a machine, it's pretty much
wasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said before, if you're going to
put that much time into growing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: into drying it and curing it, why not sit
around the table with whoever's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke it with you?
[SPEAKER_00]: You said we are growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming there's you and probably a
spouse or a partner or whatever you call
[SPEAKER_00]: it these days and maybe a couple of
friends, maybe a roommate or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys should all sit around the table
and trim it up, talk, have a good time,
[SPEAKER_00]: experience that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably have, but I'm saying that's
what should happen in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand it gets overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of great trim machines,
but there's not one that I can recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: because I stay away from them and I hire
humans to trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: So honestly, that's my a hundred percent
honest guidance on trim machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody out there has a trim machine
that they think trims to the quality of a
[SPEAKER_00]: hand trimmer of a person, send me a
message, send me a video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am very open.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know about these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's shit that I don't know enlighten
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to be on the knowledge team.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I can share that information with
the listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you think about trim
machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got one that can compete with my
quality trim grow from your heart at
[SPEAKER_00]: hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to another email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy sent me like a multiple
multi-choice email and it won't open,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'll make it open, but it won't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello email.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one just says podcast topic,
the freedom of strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel about trading?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it legal to ship cuttings to legal
States due to low THC content?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do I feel about trading strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like if you've got a clone and I've got
a clone and I want what you've gotten vice
[SPEAKER_00]: versa, like baseball cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I love trading strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten some of my best strains by
trading stuff before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like having a good baseball card.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That specific cut could be like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a baseball guy, but I listened to
enough Greg proofs to know that like a
[SPEAKER_00]: Mickey mantle card would be worth some
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, or if I had a satchel page
baseball card, I could probably trade that
[SPEAKER_00]: for a bunch of other cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I've got that one good cut,
like back in the day, if you had Girl
[SPEAKER_00]: Scout cookies around here, I could trade
my Girl Scout cookies forum cut for almost
[SPEAKER_00]: any cut that anybody had.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gorilla glue is very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: My grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not let that out to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have offered me ridiculous trades
for my mother plant of my grateful dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't let it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: However.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I totally love the freedom of
trading strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should give strains away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give people clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a friend start a grow recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave them shit tons of clones just to
get them started.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's you should give away and trade
clones and seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a pack of seeds,
if you've got 20 seeds and you only want
[SPEAKER_00]: to run 10 and your buddy's got 10 seeds of
something else trade, do it, get it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then he also said, is it legal to ship
cuttings to legal states due to low THC
[SPEAKER_00]: content?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot speak on shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not know anything about shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the legalities of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly avoid shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to put anything in the mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of a paranoid old hippie on that
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't really put anything in the mail
unless it's absolutely necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't speak too much on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low THC content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess if you're shipping hemp plants
from one legal state to another,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's probably okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But isn't the shipping system isn't that
owned by the government?
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that federal?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're probably fucking up somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would avoid that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then your question continues with people
slash clubs buying and renaming genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: selling breeding rights, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me touch on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: People and clubs buying and renaming
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really hate it when I give somebody a
clone and they grow that clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I know that they harvest it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like a little while later,
they've got a bag of something that smells
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly like the clone that I gave them
tastes just like it looks just like it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're calling it some different shit
because they want to take some credit for
[SPEAKER_00]: it, or they want to make some extra money
off of it by calling it something
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is frustrating shit right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Call it what it is, or the clubs will do
it also.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clubs, somebody else will name
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have medical marijuana here in
Colorado, and some people really like
[SPEAKER_00]: specific strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people really dislike other strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you know that, I'm going to say
sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: If sour diesel works well, for you
medicinally, you want to go get sour
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if somebody just named some shit on
the shelf, sour diesel, and you go spend
[SPEAKER_00]: your money on it and you get home and you
smoke it and say, you've got Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe this is just hypothetical.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got Parkinson's disease and sour
diesel makes you quit trembling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just spent your hard earned money
on this eighth or this quarter of medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: and you went home and you probably took
all day to get that bowl packed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you finally smoked that fucker and you
thought you were going to quit shaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some asshole just mislabeled some weed
because it would sell if it were called
[SPEAKER_00]: sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not going to do what you need
properly for your medicinal effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you just kind of wasted your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're disappointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably wasted an Uber ride or a
drive over to the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit sucks when people in clubs buy
and rename genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that everything needs to be left
the proper name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to speak out against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really dislike when extract companies
take two different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like right now, I'm not going to call out
the brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to talk about what I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some Curious George live resin in
my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know of a strain called Curious
George, but there's some bananas and
[SPEAKER_00]: probably some gorilla glue or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just blended those two strains
together and called it Curious George,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I mean, that's creative,
but they didn't breed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess they get to name that hash blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it would be better if they put
like what Terpex did on this container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpex printed Taffy Plus Cascade Nug Run
Shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't put an X to make you think
it's crossed because if you put Taffy
[SPEAKER_00]: Times Cascade, it makes it look like it's
a hybrid of that because that's how a
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder would do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Terpex does it Taffy Plus Cascade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know straight up what two strains are
in this hash blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe I've got a friend who,
if she smokes too heavy of a sativa,
[SPEAKER_00]: she will have a panic attack right in
front of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: She might piss her pants.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'll cry.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'll have to leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets ridiculous if she smokes too much
sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: That cascade in there, that would be too
much for her head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she knows straight up not to buy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This other one, it doesn't say what's in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she doesn't know if she can even smoke
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she probably wouldn't even waste her
time buying it to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it sucks when people rename
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we need to keep the names
true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that Budtenders or somebody in the
dispensary, I think that the jar should
[SPEAKER_00]: say, and let's say maybe they have Lemon
Jeffery on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it should say Lemon Jeffery and
then it should have a lab test of THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD, maybe CBN, CBG, and THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those need to be listed on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then underneath Lemon Jeffery,
it needs to tell you the genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Skunk and Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to let you know that that's the
parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would be really helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it also should have the sativa or
indica or hybrid marker, which is a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: nother conversation because everything's
pretty much a hybrid these days in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion, but you can have things that lean
toward the indica and the sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I think about people
renaming strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if I give you seeds or clones,
you better call it that shit when you grow
[SPEAKER_00]: it just to keep it true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what if somebody breeds with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're really fucking things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're really throwing off the family
tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to keep the cannabis family tree in
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of our job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Myself as a breeder, that's really part of
my job is to keep it true to where there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a history and a family tree so that we can
look back when things get different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think that's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to be kind of a preservationist,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your email goes on to say, more casts
on genetics and origins, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to talk a lot more about
genetics and origins, but the only things
[SPEAKER_00]: I would really feel fully comfortable
talking about would probably be strains
[SPEAKER_00]: that I bred because they're the only ones
that I would know the true origin of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because unfortunately, a lot of the
popular cuts, there's a lot of lies and
[SPEAKER_00]: misinformation and bullshit based around
the origins of those cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we know where Gorilla Glue came from
because Josie Wales bred that and told us
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know where Golden Goat came from
because Mr. Dank bred that and told us
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are a lot of lies and rumors and
untrue stories about things like Girl
[SPEAKER_00]: Scout cookies and of course, the OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there are probably 20 different
stories about OG Kush that I've heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to talk about where I
think it came from too much because I feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like I'm just diluting the true story
since I really wasn't there and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd love to talk more about origins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one day I'll talk about some of the
strains that I created since I can tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you where they came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm certain of those and I won't
create any bullshit stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I made a note of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will talk about that in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I want to thank you
once again for sending me those messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: That message came from a dude called That
Heavy Slim Guy on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to That Heavy Slim Guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love getting messages from everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to send me a message,
I would prefer you shoot it to me at
[SPEAKER_00]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the email address is the easiest
way to keep it organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most reliable and I will find
your message there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're already corresponding,
on Facebook or Instagram or wherever we
[SPEAKER_00]: might be talking, just keep sending me
your messages there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll continue the conversation there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to start a new
conversation, please hit me up at
[SPEAKER_00]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do like making content from all
the messages I receive from the listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lets me know that I'm hitting my target
audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lets me know I'm talking about
something you guys want to hear about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it always gives me good content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now at the start of the show, I did say I
was going to talk about the cannabis clubs
[SPEAKER_00]: in Colorado Springs receiving a cease and
desist letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pulling up a website now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pulling up the Denver Post website.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this article comes from the Colorado
Springs Gazette.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not give an author name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will get into the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to give credit, but there's no one
to give credit here besides the Denver
[SPEAKER_00]: Post and the Springs Gazette.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the article goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The club sprang up after amendment 64 was
passed in 2012, legalizing adult sales and
[SPEAKER_00]: use of recreational marijuana,
but banning public consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clubs gave people a place to use
cannabis and socialize in private.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado Springs outlawed sales of
recreational marijuana in the city,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the clubs got around the ban by
providing pot to their patrons for a
[SPEAKER_00]: reimbursement model.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could either trade cannabis for
membership or sign affidavit saying the
[SPEAKER_00]: club was growing the customers legally
allowed six marijuana plants for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let me back up and talk about a couple
of things on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado Springs outlawed sales of
recreational marijuana in the city of
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we did pass recreational marijuana,
counties were allowed, counties and cities
[SPEAKER_00]: were allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: To decide if they wanted recreational
marijuana dispensaries in their county or
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of places said, no, Denver has a
lot of recreational marijuana available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo has recreational cannabis
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado Springs is right in the middle
and they banned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way that the city got around it or
the way that people got around it was by
[SPEAKER_00]: opening up these cannabis clubs and
working on what they called here,
[SPEAKER_00]: the reimbursement model, which means you
can sign a paper that says you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: member.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably pay a cover charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can walk into that club.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they've got some cannabis and you
want to smoke it, they won't sell it to
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll give it to you, but you've got to
reimburse them for the electricity that
[SPEAKER_00]: they spent and the time that somebody
spent trimming it and whatever they feel
[SPEAKER_00]: the product is worth, you've got to
reimburse them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that they made that legal was
these people would sign over their legal
[SPEAKER_00]: plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Colorado, when you get a medical
marijuana card, you were allowed six
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pay a larger fee or you can talk
to your doctor and he may give you what's
[SPEAKER_00]: called an elevated plant count where you
can grow more plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will offer up to 99 plants in some
cases, but you'll take your medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana paperwork and there's a spot
where you sign your provider and you will
[SPEAKER_00]: make whoever runs this cannabis club would
now become your provider.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that place is legally pseudo kind
of allowed to grow your six plants for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you go there, you walk in and
you're already a member there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're able to consume products that
are there on site.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no longer like this since they came
and made these new rules and sent this
[SPEAKER_00]: cease and desist letter, but this is how
it used to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, although the city officials view
such actions as de facto sales,
[SPEAKER_00]: the practice has continued.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ban passed in March, however,
says the clubs cannot sell, trade,
[SPEAKER_00]: give, distribute, or allow the transfer of
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're technically not allowed to be
reimbursed or sell or trade cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cannot give cannabis away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is kind of weird because what's a
cannabis social club without cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't say that we can't consume it in
there right now, but that was part of what
[SPEAKER_00]: they, part of the new rules was we
couldn't consume in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the ban gave clubs that existed
before September 23rd, 2015, eight years
[SPEAKER_00]: to phase out their businesses and effort
to help the owners protect their
[SPEAKER_00]: investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But under the law, every owner had to
submit a consumption club application and
[SPEAKER_00]: a $200 fee by April 29th to get a one-year
renewable license.
[SPEAKER_00]: For $90 plus registration fees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only five clubs applied by the deadline.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was approved, two were under
consideration and two were denied.
[SPEAKER_00]: The denied clubs along with seven other
identified clubs that did not apply for
[SPEAKER_00]: licensing have been ordered to close
because they are not licensed as required.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now guys, I talk about this a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I talk about cannabis
consumption clubs, we talk about the Canna
[SPEAKER_00]: Canyon or the Dab Lounge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about this all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you were writing legislation for your
area, if your state or your locality is
[SPEAKER_00]: inventing and writing and creating the
laws for medical or recreational cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: in your area or any type of cannabis use
in your area, please include some type of
[SPEAKER_00]: safe smoking area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a consumption club.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a place where adults can go and
congregate and consume cannabis safely
[SPEAKER_00]: like adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people that come from all over
the world to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody 21 and over can drive to Denver or
Pueblo and they can show an ID and if
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got some money, they can buy some
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they leave that dispensary,
there's nowhere safe for them to consume
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't smoke in your car because you'll
get a DUI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, excuse me, I'm coughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't smoke at the park because that
is illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't roll up a joint and walk down
the street and safely smoke in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is frowned upon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what we did here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nowhere practical or safe to smoke
the cannabis you just bought at the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go to your hotel and a lot of
hotels make you sign a paper when you
[SPEAKER_00]: check in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says that they will charge you $250.
[SPEAKER_00]: $250 to $500 for cleaning your room if you
smoke cannabis in there because they think
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to fuck that room up.
[SPEAKER_00]: $250 to $500 worth of stank.
[SPEAKER_00]: You better have some good weed if it costs
$500 to get the smell out of that hotel
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nowhere practical to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need these consumption places,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're writing the legislation and
writing the rules, please be sure to
[SPEAKER_00]: include that because that's where we
screwed up here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would have it pretty well, pretty good
if we didn't skip that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: What really sucks, you guys, is I'm
passionate about this because a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: my friends own these businesses,
but I feel for every owner, how are my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends that were promised eight years to
continue doing business to recoup their
[SPEAKER_00]: assets or recoup their investments,
how are they expected to pay their bills
[SPEAKER_00]: now that they're not allowed to work on
the business model that they have designed
[SPEAKER_00]: and been operating on?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not allowed to reimburse for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not allowed to give it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not allowed to trade it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no transaction involved for
cannabis, which honestly was a large
[SPEAKER_00]: portion of these people's revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how are they going to pay the rent?
[SPEAKER_00]: As I'm recording, the first is creeping up
on us, and I know hopefully these
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses have more than one month of
finances put aside, but you never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to buy products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to pay vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to keep the lights on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently, some of them are growing
products somewhere, which costs money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to pay to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to pay trimmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to pay electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil costs money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything costs money when you're doing
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making money costs a shit ton of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Money is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are these folks, how are my friends,
how is our community going to pay their
[SPEAKER_00]: rent now that they are not allowed to
function under their business plan?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not find it fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that we can do something about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rally you guys for a city council
meeting, but it's already happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were in Colorado Springs,
please go to the city council meetings and
[SPEAKER_00]: show support for the cannabis clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are something that we really need.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're allowed to have bars on every other
corner where people can go and drink
[SPEAKER_00]: whiskey and beer all day and get shitted
and cause problems, but we're not allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a place where people can go
consume some cannabis peacefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't find it to be fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Colorado model says let's regulate
cannabis like alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're going to do that, how about when
we're at a baseball game or a football
[SPEAKER_00]: game or a basketball game?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we have a medical marijuana
smoking section or a recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana smoking section right next to
the smoking section?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're going to regulate like alcohol,
let's step up and do it correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I've been ranting for
a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really hope that you show some support
for these cannabis clubs and I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: give a huge shout out to all of the
cannabis club owners and proprietors and
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody who works with the clubs to make
them happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you and I respect you and
shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that you are able to continue doing
business and I hope you guys all survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know most of you are probably,
you have families.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got at least got a damn dog in a house
to take care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit's expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you find a means to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it all works out for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I want to wrap up the podcast with
another message.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from Year of the Gorilla on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Year of the Gorilla was the winner of the
hashtag mullet challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if anybody listened to that
episode, but I did the mullet challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to find somebody in their pajamas
at a Walmart with a mullet and snap a
[SPEAKER_00]: picture and send it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dude followed all of the
instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: He meets the criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Year of the Gorilla.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got some stickers coming your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time this episode comes out,
the stickers will be in the mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: The check's in the mail, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he also sent me a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, I was wondering
if you have any favorite pest management
[SPEAKER_00]: routines, like products you use in
applications and how often I know having a
[SPEAKER_00]: clean grow and proper environmental
control play a key role in keeping things
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy and happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, maybe what would you do if an
outbreak occurs and how to stay positive
[SPEAKER_00]: and overcome challenges in the grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the first part of that talking about
pest management routines and the products
[SPEAKER_00]: that I use, that'll be another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am writing an episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got notes for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a notebook filled with notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, a lot of people probably
wouldn't believe how many notes I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: and how many half shows I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of stuff prepared,
but I'm doing an episode on how to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify problems and how to treat for
problems and how to prevent problems on
[SPEAKER_00]: the list of things that we're going to
talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got spider mites, whiteflies,
fungus gnats, thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just the top of the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about how to identify
those on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about all the pest management
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I want to get to this part of
this message is also maybe what to do if
[SPEAKER_00]: an outbreak occurs and how to stay
positive and overcome challenges in your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, because that is super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of people have a problem at
the beginning of the grow, just not too
[SPEAKER_00]: far in, and they get completely frustrated
and they feel defeated from the very
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning and it feels like they're
fighting an uphill battle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is a plant that wants to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is hard to kill.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to almost try to kill cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you get a problem, you have to first
identify the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you have to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have to figure out how to solve
that problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have to put that plan into action
and solve your problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then your problem will be solved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you do it right, you have a
stronger sense of pride because you
[SPEAKER_00]: overcame something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody can put some plants in some soil,
pour some nutrients and some water on
[SPEAKER_00]: them, put them under some lights and let
them grow for nine or 12 weeks and produce
[SPEAKER_00]: some cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's when you have a problem that you had
to overcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it more fun for a guy like
myself, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's how I stay positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like the mundane, boring life at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I do what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I live the way that I live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly think that causing some
problems and screwing up makes you a
[SPEAKER_00]: better grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't learn how to walk until you
fell down a few times and then you didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: learn how to run until you were good at
walking and then you fucked up running a
[SPEAKER_00]: few times and scraped up your knees.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to make some mistakes and
overcome them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I stay positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that I'm learning something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there's something going to
come out of that mistake that I made.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I stay positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, man, you're growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't get too upset about what you did
because you're growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a problem, maybe you got
spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, you have to accept it because shit
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You made a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's a crack in the wall that
spider mites climb through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might not even really be something you
could have thought about or could have
[SPEAKER_00]: done anything about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Accept it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Text Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do whatever you got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figure out how to get rid of those spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in whatever week, don't panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever week you're in, don't panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worst case scenario, harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flush your plants and harvest them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just flush them out more quickly than
those bugs can eat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest it and get what you can out of the
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get something even if it's
just experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So find what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Identify it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then take the steps to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then clean up the grow room and go
back at it harder than ever before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And next time when you see the very
warning of spider mites in that room,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to know exactly what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to identify it more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just going to be better at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that part of me will always know
that I'm bigger than every bug and I can
[SPEAKER_00]: find some sort of thing to destroy any
insect that gets into my room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got books that can show me how to
get rid of any sort of mold or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just confident that I can take down
any problem that I'm given in a grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some crazy shit happen in grow
rooms before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had fans fall and chop up plants and
lights have come undone and I've ran
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stuff that can go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had PVC pipes with, oh, I forgot how
many gallons per minute this pump used to
[SPEAKER_00]: push, but way too many gallons of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This PVC pipe exploded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water went everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that a lot of crazy shit happened in a
grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to smile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to put some reggae music on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to turn up the headphones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe go take a couple dabs and just get
in there and solve the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like anything else in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit's going to happen all the time,
every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life would be way too easy if shit went
right all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I expect problems in a grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, when I ran the big grow and I
was training new people, they would always
[SPEAKER_00]: say, so what's the first thing you got to
do when you get here?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would always say, find the surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd be like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be like, well, that's a big ass grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a hundred and something lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got like 50 fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of pumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of PVC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get to find what fucked up overnight
while we were gone, because it's been like
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 hours since we've been here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so everybody just laughed at first and
they'd really realize like, oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: every day when we get in here,
there's some weird shit that we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: find and we have to repair or handle
before we can even go about normal
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either laugh it off and just have
a good time and clean it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do whatever you got to do, or you can have
a stroke about it and be pissed off all
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I choose to just have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that growing cannabis,
there's no need to really get too mad
[SPEAKER_00]: about too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for that message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really, I hope I was a little bit
inspiring and I hope I answered at least
[SPEAKER_00]: half of your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a shout out to my boy year of the
gorilla.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check your mailbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably have some stickers waiting for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can hear that noise in the
background, that's my boy Mick the dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's chewing on a deer antler and yeah,
here he comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, boy?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the dog is going to find a camping
spot right here by my feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to scratch on him for a little
bit.
