[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start this podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of banana is
foster live batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of banana og and Paris
Larry.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, the flavor is described as
banana, sugar and oatmeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really unique combination of
flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of like a banana sugar cookie or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that candy banana flavor and
there's definitely a sweetness maybe an
[SPEAKER_00]: oatmeal cookie aftertaste.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love the banana turps and the
buzz I get from banana flavored dabs on
[SPEAKER_00]: the back of the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says it contains 67.4 9% THC and non
detectable amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the bananas foster live
batter.

[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I did include a link in the
show notes and the video description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, you guys, this is the portion of
the show where we jump into the Patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not waste too much time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first message comes from Austin Ron,
and it goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace, Grover love and gracias from the
heart of prohibition land, the lone star
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got listeners down in Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friends in Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am an avid listener of your channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a new home grower and I love your
succinct and detailed as necessary
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for letting us into your growers
headspace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for listening to all of my
channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you include the podcast,
the Instagram live, feeds the inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: embracing organics appearances and all of
the other random places where I pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for checking me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes on to say, I thought I
would share this on grafting a rather
[SPEAKER_00]: obscure topic in the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after listening to your assertions,
correction and re correction, I found this
[SPEAKER_00]: and while not conclusive, the following
offers indication if not evidence that
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring from grafted plants contain DNA
from both plants, who would have thunk it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for fighting the good fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rock on bro from our friend Austin Ron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a few episodes back, I did talk about
grafting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody asked me if I was interested in
grafting, if I could give advice about
[SPEAKER_00]: grafting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that in my opinion, that if we
graft one plant to another plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: that over time, those genetics will mingle
and we will not have true genetics on both
[SPEAKER_00]: branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been receiving controversial
messages, no hate mail or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some people are saying that is
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say it is impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people told me I was reaching no
longer reaching here is volunteered
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think all of the evidence points to the
fact that the genes will move.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to explain it succinctly in my
last episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I cut off your arm and I cut off my
arm and we swap arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, that's your arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine is going to be the real pale long
gangly arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be the darker arm and thicker arm
on my body will know where they came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the blood will move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually the DNA will move.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of what's mean will be in that arm all
of what's you will be in your arm will be
[SPEAKER_00]: your arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'll mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the trees, the plants,
the branches will do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got some scientific evidence
from our friend Austin Ron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to Austin Ron.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will skim this article just to appease
my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know that there is some proof
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys are interested, I will include
this link in the show notes and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: read the article about grafting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to set it right here on my
computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't forget to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also write the word link here on the
notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully I remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Austin Ron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the Patreon support and for
the great update on my lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to keep moving because I do
have quite a few great messages from
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from C dub in NorCal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Rasta Jeff vibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good way to start a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all of the good vibes and
helpful information that you keep
[SPEAKER_00]: radiating.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking a great way to start a
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good vibes and information that I'm
radiating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Goes on to say I'd like to send some of
that love back your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blessings of peace and health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says and may your genetics be strong
and your flowers beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have seen evidence of such so your
blessings are working.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I was hoping to ask a few
questions and I do not object to you using
[SPEAKER_00]: any of this in any formal format or any
formal format except sharing my email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I'll keep you safe and private
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say I was hoping,
I know you're into concentrates,
[SPEAKER_00]: but which feminized seeds from iry would
you recommend for a flower smoker?
[SPEAKER_00]: I primarily smoke with bongs and sometimes
joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing is limited to a couple 10 to 15
gallon containers outdoor and stealth is
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciated shorter and not quite so
fragrant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want a recommendation on an iry
genetics strain you're not a concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be smoking the flowers
probably through the bong or sometimes a
[SPEAKER_00]: joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like your style.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to grow in 10 to 15 gallon
containers outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stealth would be ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want something that smells
like skunks and feet and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, I think that we need to recommend
orangegasm to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orangegasm is really easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to handle outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to smell like skunk ass and
dirty feet and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to smell like oranges and
orange creamsicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to get a different aroma
that's a little bit less suspicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also easier to grow outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take super long to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it'll make you really happy in
the joint and in the bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to taste like fucking sweet,
delicious oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're into that orange flavor,
that'll be beautiful for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, I may recommend we're going to
want something outdoors a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, it's hard to get away from the skunky
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some strawberry starburst,
but it may take too long to finish
[SPEAKER_00]: wherever you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: The prana may get you away with it,
but that prana has got that herb smell to
[SPEAKER_00]: it, although it's a wonderful plant
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot more to this message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for the cough there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did take dabs before the show and it's a
cannabis podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may cough again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I was also wondering
about auto flowers outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that worth starting for the fall or the
winter?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure I could keep them out of
any rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is there enough light and warmth to
produce any quality flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not an auto flower expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really, I don't grow any auto
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know much about auto flowers,
but if you can get them to finish before
[SPEAKER_00]: any adverse conditions, yeah, they'll
flower out there, put them out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll grow, they'll flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get usable product depending on who
you buy your seeds from and how you take
[SPEAKER_00]: care of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your results may vary, but yeah,
auto flowers will work as long as they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get snowed on and get destroyed by
the winter environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor auto flowers are a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I'm pretty sure I could
keep them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we read that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, any recommendations for breeders on
feminized auto flower seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am friends with Mephisto Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daz from Mephisto is a great dude,
has helped me out, has done me a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to return the favor and say,
I would recommend Mephisto,
[SPEAKER_00]: M-E-P-H-I-S-T-O, Mephisto for feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is who I've seen the best results
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's who I've heard the best from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, disclaimer, huge disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not grow auto flowers, so I can't
testify firsthand.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all from what I've seen,
read, and heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the dude's a friend of mine,
so I want to give him a shout out and rep
[SPEAKER_00]: him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Mephisto auto flowers would be the way
to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I'm in NorCal and I've had some
falling ash and it keeps swirling around
[SPEAKER_00]: the breeze and getting on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what to believe about bud
washing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we're working into a brand
new question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what to believe about bud
washing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hoping you could shed some light on
that subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I even be considering it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only a little bit of ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of differing opinions and I
really don't know who is reputable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the bud washing recipe I've been
considering are, and then he shares his
[SPEAKER_00]: recipe with me and I'm going to shit all
over that recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a better idea for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even going to read that plan here on
the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our listener friend is in California
and unfortunately they're being ravaged
[SPEAKER_00]: and devastated by wildfires right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big love and big shout out to everybody
who's having to deal with that fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: My heart goes out to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire is fucking terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen several people displaced due to
fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank your, thank your, whatever you
believe in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank it that your shit's not burned down
because a lot of stuff burned down this
[SPEAKER_00]: summer and is continuing to burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point is there is ash falling from the
sky in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was ash falling from the sky in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people were getting ashes in
their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see the ash building up in the
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see ash laying on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people were scrambling and
trying, I said scrambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people were scrambling and trying
to figure out what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people were out there with shop vacs
trying to suck off the ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are out there with leaf
blowers trying to blow the ash off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people just said fuck it and let the
ash develop because there's nothing they
[SPEAKER_00]: can do about such a large crop with ash
falling from the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are going to result to,
or resort to what is known as bud washing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is exactly what it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a post harvest bud wash,
just like giving your car a wash,
[SPEAKER_00]: giving anything else a wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the same idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is most commonly done for crops that
have been infested with powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will wash the powdery mildew off of
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do this to a commercial crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can run this commercial crop that has
been treated the way I'm going to tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: through microbial testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: After it's had powdery mildew on it,
if it's done properly, this method will
[SPEAKER_00]: remove the powdery mildew and you will
pass Colorado regulated microbe testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got powdery mildew on your
buds, if you've got ashes on your buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is the only reason I would recommend
bud washing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most cases, I don't find it necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find it to be more, you're going to
cause more problems than you are good
[SPEAKER_00]: unless you've already got powdery mildew
or ashes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly don't want to recommend that
you wash powdery mildew off.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I understand that people are
going to do what they've got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: People grew a big ass crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a private grow, if it's an indoor
grow, an outdoor grow, a commercial grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: people grew a product and they see it and
they do not want to throw it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it were up to me, that would get
tossed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a non viable product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to chalk that one up to me
fucking up and having to correct an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody thinks the way that I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody operates the way I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are going to be different solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to ash and powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you got to scramble the ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not your fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand you got to make a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to wash it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's more acceptable than powdery mildew
to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're going to do a flower wash or
a post harvest bud wash, if you insist on
[SPEAKER_00]: doing so, this is how I recommend you do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a quick drink and then
we'll jump into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had a three bucket method in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend the three buckets at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use one five gallon bucket and I dumped
my five gallon bucket frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the powdery mildew layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can probably see the ash layer develop
on the top of the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as you see that nice little
funky layer, dump it and start over.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, you know, you're getting a good
cleaning out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the basic way to do bud washing,
I get a five gallon bucket and I fill it
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the way with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to leave some room because
you're going to put buds and your hands in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need room to work in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill it most of the way with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got five gallons of water in a five
gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an inch to work with maybe two
inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I use 30 percent hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: The expensive shit, the good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what I buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the amount of powdery mildew,
I'm trying to rinse off of my plants or
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps the amount of ash I'm trying to
wash off of my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will help me determine how much
peroxide I want to add to this water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may start with approximately 25
milliliters per five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: If my shit is real intense and real bad,
I may consider 50 mills.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would never go above 70 milliliters of
hydrogen peroxide per five gallon bucket
[SPEAKER_00]: of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's if you need more than that,
it's a lost cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't even bother washing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got our five gallon bucket and we
have put 30 to 50, maybe a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliters of 30 percent hydrogen
peroxide in this bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Disclaimer time, sidebar, personal
protective equipment must be used before
[SPEAKER_00]: you even pick up the bottle of hydrogen
peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you think about it, put on rubber
gloves before you pick up the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put on some sort of goggles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hydrogen peroxide will fuck your skin
and your eyes up very bad if it comes in
[SPEAKER_00]: contact with your skin and or eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will burn your eyes to shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will burn your skin and make your skin
turn white and bubbly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on how sensitive your skin is,
you will have different reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen hydrogen peroxide and zero
tall reactions on skin before.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to prevent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put on gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put on a long sleeve shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put on you're wearing a mask already
because it's covid time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put on a mask over your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put on some rubber or some goggles,
not rubber gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put rubber gloves on your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I catch you with rubber gloves on your
face, you're going to get a drug test and
[SPEAKER_00]: get written up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put some goggles on your face so you don't
get that shit in your eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protect yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff will dissolve the powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means it will also dissolve other
organic components, which could be your
[SPEAKER_00]: eyeball.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're going to get paranoid that it's
going to dissolve your trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to rinse it and pull it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to be in there long enough
to do anything to get rid of the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not intense enough to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to wash that powdery
mildew right off of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your personal protective
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got goggles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say before you even get the fucking
peroxide out, because I've seen people
[SPEAKER_00]: reach for a product on a shelf and they
pull it off the shelf and the lid wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: on it all the way and they poured it on
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people shake a bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just you go to grab whatever and you shake
your drink like this and the lid's not on
[SPEAKER_00]: it and it fucking splashes into your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear some protective equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit won't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your proper personal
protective equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got your gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got your goggles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a mask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully long sleeves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always guys wear shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're outdoors, you're being a fucking
hippie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wear some shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want pesticides and products on
your feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soles of your feet are one of the
number one most absorbent parts of your
[SPEAKER_00]: body for absorbing pesticides and toxic
chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably also absorbing positive shit,
but we don't think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't stress on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you shouldn't be running
around barefoot in a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if I've applied a pesticide in the
grow, it landed on the floor and now it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going up through the bottoms of your feet
into your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protect yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you want to have fun and be a
hippie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels real good, but this is growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're smoking medical cannabis so we don't
get cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not go fucking play with pesticides
and absorb them in our feet to give us
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to balance this shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So personal protective equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your hydrogen peroxide,
30 to 50, maybe a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliters mixed into your five gallon
bucket of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just use plain water right from the tap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just room temperature or whatever
temperature you can fuck with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hose temperature, I guess you probably
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I've got gloves on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've harvested my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut it into manageable sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just chunks, probably branches
somewhere between six, eight, 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: 12, maybe 14 inches long.
[SPEAKER_00]: However deep that five gallon bucket is,
I want to grab my buds, my branches,
[SPEAKER_00]: just one branch at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do a handful if you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer one at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dunk that bitch right into the hydrogen
peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to just jostle that powdery
mildew right off of that bud and then pull
[SPEAKER_00]: it out of there and give it a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you still see more powdery mildew on
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it need another rinse?
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a jostle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shake it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you were confident that you have
knocked off all the powdery mildew and
[SPEAKER_00]: don't go fucking crazy with this jostling
motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just trying to knock it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gently knock off the powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not trying to smack the trichomes
off of the branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not trying to smack the trichomes off of
the branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not trying to smack the trichomes off the
buds, knock the buds off the branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not trying to destroy everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to fix our problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just gently jostle it in that water,
knock those trichomes off, give it a good
[SPEAKER_00]: rinse, pull it out, then hang it up and
let it drip dry and put a fan near it for
[SPEAKER_00]: a little while while it's drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put the fan right directly on it,
but have air moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a dehumidifier near it so you can get
rid of all that excess moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not trap these plants that you just
dunked into a humid area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not want to cause mildew problems
in these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them plenty of airflow in a wide open
space or somewhere you can evacuate all of
[SPEAKER_00]: that stale air you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're indoors, you need a blower
extracting air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're outdoors, just let that water
evaporate as it needs to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds will take a few hours to dry,
but they were already wet inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's natural water in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get rained on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The environment does that to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, don't trap them in a stagnant humid
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, what we're going to do,
we're going to put on our personal
[SPEAKER_00]: protective equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to mix up our hydrogen
peroxide solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to dunk each and every branch
into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to hang it up in a well
ventilated area that it will not get
[SPEAKER_00]: moldy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is our basic method for bud washing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like the method that you chose
because mixing a couple of those
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients together is going to make foam
like a volcano like we used to do in
[SPEAKER_00]: school.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't seem necessary to do to my
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also going to add different flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of the things you added in your
recipe will add flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need those flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hydrogen peroxide will evaporate or
dissipate very rapidly, very, very
[SPEAKER_00]: rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be gone before the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be no remaining aroma,
no remaining flavor, no residuals at all
[SPEAKER_00]: if you do it correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got big giant buds that are
fucking footballs or donkey dicks or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you want to call them,
you may need to cut those big chunky buds
[SPEAKER_00]: down to smaller, more manageable pieces
because in the inside there, you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get moisture trapped in there and you
may cause potential problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got big chunky football,
donkey dick, whatever you want to call
[SPEAKER_00]: them, buds, big spears, maybe break them
down into smaller, more manageable pieces,
[SPEAKER_00]: pieces that aren't going to have a bunch
of moisture trapped inside of there so
[SPEAKER_00]: that you create your own problem after
doing your dunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very mindful that you just added a
bunch of unnecessary water to your
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging, drying, and curing environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to remove that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to keep airflow happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shit's going to drip all over the
floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to come mop that shit up off
the floor just to get the water out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the time to really think you're
trying to save the crop, not make it
[SPEAKER_00]: worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, C-dub and NorCal, I hope I
helped you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do see a lot of people out there talking
about it and performing bud washes right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something I would do unless it's
highly, highly necessary, but I understand
[SPEAKER_00]: that ash is undesirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want ashes on the buds until
right before we hit it or right before it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets to our lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the way to rinse them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a 30% hydrogen peroxide,
you can also use zero tall, maybe use less
[SPEAKER_00]: zero tall than hydrogen peroxide if you
choose to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the 30% hydrogen peroxide at 30 to 50
mls per gallon, drop it in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: give it a shake, knock that PM off,
knock those ashes off, then hang it up to
[SPEAKER_00]: dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know how this works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got any follow-up questions,
I would be more than happy to help you
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email, iregeneticsathotmail
.com, or hit me on Patreon, patreon.com
[SPEAKER_00]: forward slash grow from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a quick look here to see
how long we've been recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my time going on my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got plenty of time for at least one
more message.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend North North
Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up North?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to hear from you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to North quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message goes, what up Rasta Jeff?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a pleasure to communicate with
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always great to hear from you too,
brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say a shout out to white Mike on his
recent episode on operation legalize the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, your next operation is legalize the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not doing just states anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not doing our nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a global mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalize worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, you are heading that that is yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are in charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You direct the army.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us know what you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to legalize worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says anyways, with that being said,
I have a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If maybe you could clarify on using
microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you could clarify on using microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be a period there that says
I've been experimenting with it using
[SPEAKER_00]: hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just curious if there is a
preferred method of microbes and feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: and process for the best way to balance
your pH as quickly as possible so that I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't run into deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if I'm asking the right question,
I think you might know what I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: get at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm hoping you can help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, my guru.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace, love, and respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know exactly what you're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we add our microbes to our pH
solution, it can drastically change the pH
[SPEAKER_00]: of our feeding solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can drastically change the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's going to go up or
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on where your solution is and
what microbes you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it goes way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when we add the when I had
recharge, I think my pH goes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this listener, so North is concerned
that we are disrupting the pH to a manner
[SPEAKER_00]: which it will disrupt the uptake of the
elements and nutrients that are available
[SPEAKER_00]: to the plant in that nutrient solution,
which is a valid concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just put a bunch of expensive nutrients
into a reservoir, into a tank,
[SPEAKER_00]: into a feeding system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to feed it to our
plants and hope the plants get the best
[SPEAKER_00]: out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I'm going to add another product
that's going to fuck that all up and mess
[SPEAKER_00]: up the pH and make some of the nutrients
unavailable to my plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I understand what you're asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we mix up our stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We add a liquid or a powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are going to say to adjust
your pH before you add your microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people will say to adjust the pH
after you add your microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you get your solution mixed up,
adjust your pH and then add your microbes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think it will work perfectly the
other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you Scotty and guru have some
information, maybe an update on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see what happens if you ask them
the exact same question, because they make
[SPEAKER_00]: a microbial product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm using a lot of my experience and
knowledge to talk from using that
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to recharge, real Grover's
recharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a recharge ad, but that's one
of the main products I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know where you're coming from with
this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we mix in that recharge, it makes the
pH go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we add that to our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are concerned that since we have,
usually we are stubborn about the pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: we want to adjust the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the right range to make elements
bioavailable to our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When those microbes come in contact with
the water and the rhizosphere,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a carbonic reaction that happens
to the best of my knowledge, almost
[SPEAKER_00]: instantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take a lot of time for the
other elements, the water, the
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere, the other nutrients to
neutralize that effect within the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that pH swing will be minimized within
seconds, if not minutes, depending on the
[SPEAKER_00]: size of your rhizosphere and the amount of
water, but you're not using fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds of gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's going to happen almost
instantaneously when that water hits the
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's all just going to go,
Oh wait, I was way out of whack because I
[SPEAKER_00]: was in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in suspension, but now I have hit
something that I know what to do with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it all, I think it balances itself out
almost instantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I would like to hear Guru and
Scotty's feedback and input on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys are listening, dude,
chime in, either send me a message or just
[SPEAKER_00]: do a podcast about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, are my microbes,
is the pH of my microbes going to mess up
[SPEAKER_00]: my uptake of my plants and how do I
prevent that from happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the gist of the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you guys have feedback, I invite you
to send me a message or do your own show
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scotty and Guru, check out the Dude Grow
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, Scotty Real is the proprietor
of Recharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's going to have answers to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to have answers to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate to just pass the buck on a
question, but when I know that there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: expert right down the street that we can
contact, I think that's what we'll do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to write down a note to Ask
Guru.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm writing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to write it on this page also so
I can find this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll ask Guru and Scotty Real,
but I think I gave you the appropriate
[SPEAKER_00]: answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that, I think the carbonic
reaction happens almost instantaneously to
[SPEAKER_00]: where you don't have to worry about that
pH fluctuation for just a very short
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's of any concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to talk to people who are
absolutely more qualified to answer that
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not shy to admit that I am not a
microbe expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since Guru and Scotty are just a text
message away, I will ask them.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it is not an appropriate time to
message them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm recording kind of late at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get some self time to myself late at
night here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd probably be mad at me if I text
them right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to do that, but I will
get in touch with my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get you some more useful
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, North North Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I helped you out a little bit and
hope hopefully Scotty and Guru heard this
[SPEAKER_00]: and they will chime in and give you a
little bit more info.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, I'll get it going for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I've got one more great message
that I want to answer on this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's two long episodes in a row.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm feeling good on this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my groove back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my rhythm back.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message comes from girls grow too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, I love the
legalization presentation with white Mike
[SPEAKER_00]: and just became a Patreon of his.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend girls grow to saw the
legalization presentation that featured
[SPEAKER_00]: white Mike and they went and signed up for
white Mike's Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure Mike appreciates it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that Mike's wife and little kids
appreciate that because he spoils them.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't spend money on himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to spend that contribution on
his family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Mike and his family.
[SPEAKER_00]: He appreciates your help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me keep moving because I'm fucking
rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Mike is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love the chemistry you two have.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Staying on the mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a huge compliment because
sometimes Mike does have problems staying
[SPEAKER_00]: on the microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kept him on the mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: He kept himself on the mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a huge notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are liking your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is a question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says my family, my wife finally said
yes to me getting a real grow light for
[SPEAKER_00]: Christmas this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it that the wife has given you some
permission.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm looking for a light that would
work in a four by five room.
[SPEAKER_00]: My budget is a hard 250.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's got 250 bucks to light up a four
by five room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably looking for an LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it says I would love a Canon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's in the budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think a Canon LED is in the
budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you go to blacksailmarket.com and
use coupon code Rasta Jeff and get
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself a nice deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think that 250 is going to get
you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I don't think it's in the budget
as a disabled combat veteran with
[SPEAKER_00]: epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: My grow is my life and gives me purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the second episode where I've read
about somebody being a combat veteran with
[SPEAKER_00]: a grow giving them a new purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that we're helping you out and that
you have found some purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're secretly my mentor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a secret anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever need help in the grow,
just reach out directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be more than happy to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on with thank you for all you do
for the industry and the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brother, much love and much respect your
way as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said it in the last episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate veterans and especially
combat veterans and people who've been
[SPEAKER_00]: blowed up in war and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'm a giant pussy because I don't
see myself armed and equipped and shooting
[SPEAKER_00]: at people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said in the last episode, if you shoot
at me or throw a grenade at me,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking running.
[SPEAKER_00]: I quit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Game over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you and respect you for what
you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does mean a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said it in the last episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without people protecting my freedom,
I don't know how much freedom I would
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without getting all patriotic and weird on
the episode and political, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I don't know what to recommend for a
$250 light to fill a four by five sealed
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish we could get you a couple of Canon
LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one Canon LED would fill a three
by three space and get your plants happy
[SPEAKER_00]: in that three by three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then slowly we can upgrade maybe next
Christmas, maybe next birthday or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could talk the wife into a new light,
but 250 is not going to cover a Canon LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get you close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, here's where I'm torn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of work with BlackSail.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got agreements.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't be advertising other lights in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't know what other light
company to recommend, but I do have a
[SPEAKER_00]: large audience with a lot of reach and a
lot of compassion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what I'm going to do for you,
for my friend, Girls Grow 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need some advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you guys that are listening and are
watching, please comment on the YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: channel and recommend a good solid grow
light for around 250 bucks for a disabled
[SPEAKER_00]: veteran who needs some help.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a combat veteran with epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to grow them some quality
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to improve their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need some advice on a $250 light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be an LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't say LED in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: LED would probably be best.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to save on electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be easier to cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can get a 250 watt LED light that
will work in a four by five room,
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please leave comments, details and
information in the video description here
[SPEAKER_00]: so that our friend knows where to go look.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you've got to do is go to YouTube,
pull up episode 475 and there will be
[SPEAKER_00]: advice left in the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to my audience members that are
going to help us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another thing that I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do it completely shamelessly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for a disabled combat veteran.
[SPEAKER_00]: This young man has served our country and
helped us out and he's fucked up because
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our turn to serve him back.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got 250 and he needs some grow
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a grow light company out there
that can fill in his gap?
[SPEAKER_00]: If 250 is a good start and your light
costs three or 400 bucks, is there
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody out there that wants to help out
a disabled veteran?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a shout out on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's help out our disabled veteran
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: We owe it to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's what I can do for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a recommendation,
but all the shit that I just said is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Than a recommendation for a light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the fucking the protection
for the service.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for all the Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see your name on Patreon a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We communicate quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope this works out well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and foes, smokers and growers,
combat veterans and everybody else out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who else to put in that
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, you and all your friends and family.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys for listening.
