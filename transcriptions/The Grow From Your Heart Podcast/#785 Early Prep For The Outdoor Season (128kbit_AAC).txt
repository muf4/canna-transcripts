[SPEAKER_00]: right, where do we go from there in this
episode?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am Going to give away a pack of seeds
the seed giveaway, of course is sponsored
[SPEAKER_00]: by our friends at seeds here now comm Make
sure you check out seeds here now comm and
[SPEAKER_00]: also follow them on all of these social
media Applications, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: we will give away those seeds here toward
the end of this episode before we get to
[SPEAKER_00]: that part Let's talk about the main topic
of today's episode It is January right now
[SPEAKER_00]: as we record this episode the middle of
January spring is approaching It is almost
[SPEAKER_00]: time for the outdoor season.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't seem like it's time to start
thinking about that Yet, we've got five
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe six months before plants are going
outside, but let's get prepared It's never
[SPEAKER_00]: too early to start preparing our ganja
grow if we're going to put plants outside
[SPEAKER_00]: I always recommend putting out something
that we have tested at least something
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have sex Tested a lot of growers
that grow on the coast that are able to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow bigger crops They are already
sprouting their seeds already cutting
[SPEAKER_00]: their clones getting their plants ready
for June and July and August Which is six
[SPEAKER_00]: seven eight months away, but by the time
it comes time to put those plants outside
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to Have big beefy monstrous
plants So if you don't have clones if you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have something ready now that you
already know is a female that has been
[SPEAKER_00]: tried and true Now is the time to start
prepping and planning for your outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: grow The first thing to think about is do
you have a reliable source for seeds or
[SPEAKER_00]: clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you can get seeds at seeds here
now comm or I read direct comm do some
[SPEAKER_00]: shopping find what works best for you But
now is the time to start getting those
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds if you don't already have them start
shopping start doing research we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk about What research needs to be
done?
[SPEAKER_00]: But now is the time to start getting those
seeds then as soon as you get those seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend germinating them and start
vegging them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very early We've got a lot of time
to go before the outdoor season comes But
[SPEAKER_00]: do you want to put some random untested
unvetted seeds outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or would you like to maybe give them an
audition run run them one time before you
[SPEAKER_00]: put them outside that way you can do a
quick Fino hunt find the plant that you
[SPEAKER_00]: like best then put that one outdoors and
make several clones of it and fill the
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor garden with That I understand not
everybody has an indoor garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't an option for everybody But
this will help you out in the long run if
[SPEAKER_00]: you are able to do this I recommend
getting a pack of seeds start vegging them
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend sexing those plants
There are many ways to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow them up to big enough to get
a clone from them That's up to you to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine get a clone Then you can either
put the original plant into flower or you
[SPEAKER_00]: can put that clone into flower within 10
to 14 days You will know if you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: male or female plants you can throw away
All of the males and all the male plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and corresponding clones and keep the
females Run those and do that Fino hunt to
[SPEAKER_00]: find the desirable phenotype for your area
for your needs Another way we can do it We
[SPEAKER_00]: can put these plants under 1212 lighting
put them into flower for 10 to 14 days and
[SPEAKER_00]: soon enough They will begin to show you
their sex It won't take long for those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to start showing you their sex as
soon as you identify males Remove them let
[SPEAKER_00]: them flower until you've positively
identified the sex of all of those plants
[SPEAKER_00]: then simply put the timer back To a
vegetative state you can go to 24 on and 0
[SPEAKER_00]: off or 18 6 will also work for you I do my
mother plants at 19 5 I like them to sleep
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit But I also need to give them
extra light because I've got some tropical
[SPEAKER_00]: varietals They will try to flower on me if
they don't get enough light time So those
[SPEAKER_00]: are two easy ways that you can quickly sex
your plants You can cut a clone as soon as
[SPEAKER_00]: it is time to cut a clone You can either
put that clone dome in the flower room or
[SPEAKER_00]: you can put the original plants in the
flower room within 10 to 14 days you will
[SPEAKER_00]: have identified the males and Females or
you can simply flower out your original
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and then revege them It won't take
long to revert them back to veg if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: only in flower for 10 14, maybe 17 days It
won't take that long to turn them around
[SPEAKER_00]: and they'll also grow quite large while
they're in that early phase of flower
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll really take off for you So you can
identify sex that way then as soon as you
[SPEAKER_00]: find the males remove them from the garden
now We are only working with female plants
[SPEAKER_00]: be very careful that you do not put male
plants outdoors in the grow and the
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor grow this season we don't Want to
pollinate other people's grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need stray pollen around I
recommend to you Do not put a male plant
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors the way to do that is to sex it
early Identify that before they ever make
[SPEAKER_00]: it outdoors those male plants should not
ever go outdoors imagine Vegging a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: for two three, maybe even four months
getting that plant the size of a
[SPEAKER_00]: Volkswagen and then flowering it outdoors
and ten or twelve days into the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: season You realize that big-ass plant that
you dedicated all that time that energy
[SPEAKER_00]: that space the love the care the nutrients
The water the real estate possibly the
[SPEAKER_00]: felony you dedicated all of that to a
plant that you don't even get to finish
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's a boy and you've got to cut
it down as soon as Possible, so let's sex
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants before we put them outside
That's why I'm telling you to order seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: now and grow them indoors one time if you
can I understand not everybody's got that
[SPEAKER_00]: luxury but ideally let's run them one time
indoors Find out which plant in that batch
[SPEAKER_00]: is your favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've taken a clone of it So now you've
got a mother plant of all of the plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: there when you find your favorite You can
remove the rest keep your favorite make it
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger make multiple clones of that then
put all of those clones outdoors So you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got your ideal phenotype loading up your
outdoor garden now, like I've said before
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that not everybody has got an
indoor grow space This is not optional for
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just situational availability If
you can do this do this if not,
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have other options for you I highly
recommend if you can't sex your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: before you put them outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend Feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants will be all female Seeds
there's no difference in those fem seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and reg seeds other than they will all be
females A lot of people have a lot of a
[SPEAKER_00]: stigma a lot of myth a lot of problems
with feminized seeds I'm here to tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no difference in fem seeds Then
there are regular seeds other than the
[SPEAKER_00]: fact that we have learned how to remove
all of the male pollen from the equation
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be all girl plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will perform just as well as your
male plant or your regular plants They
[SPEAKER_00]: will you can clone them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can breed with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are just as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the exact same as these The
regular plants except we've learned how to
[SPEAKER_00]: not get the male pollen in that equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they will all be female So I recommend
you run female plants outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I currently have lemon Jeffrey and golden
goat fem seeds and very soon I will
[SPEAKER_00]: restock the orangegasm fem seeds So if
you're looking for quality fems in your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden, make sure you do look for lemon
Jeffrey Look for the golden goat and if
[SPEAKER_00]: you are kind of patient look out very soon
for those orangegasm seeds That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We said it here first on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The orangegasm restock is coming Very
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, where were we run fem seeds if
you can if you can't sex your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoors and do a pre sex test before you
put them outside Then I would recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: running feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those seeds will be girls You won't
have to worry about pulling the males set
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself up for success Now here is a
crazy idea something I don't talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: too often But if you want to be creative,
you can definitely run some auto flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors We have friends who have been on
the podcast to run multiple crops of auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers Outdoors, they will start a crop
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll put it outside They'll wait two or
three weeks use the rest of the grown put
[SPEAKER_00]: that outside and that way they've got two
crops Maybe even three crops of auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers coming down in the season that we
get to grow one crop This works out very
[SPEAKER_00]: well for them because then they've got
staggered harvest That means that in two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks they get to cut down this little
plot and then they get to process all that
[SPEAKER_00]: chop it down Trim it do whatever needs to
be done processing is the word get it out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the way then in two weeks We've got
another crop coming then in two weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: another crop That helps out because then
you don't have one giant crop to cut down
[SPEAKER_00]: all at once It'll buy you some time space
out your harvest Also, I've seen people
[SPEAKER_00]: run one auto flower crop outside and one
photo period crop outside You get to cut
[SPEAKER_00]: down those autos a little bit early and
right after that your photo period crop is
[SPEAKER_00]: done I've seen that so think about what is
going to work best for you in your
[SPEAKER_00]: environment in your situation Do you want
regular seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need fem seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are you the type of person that is
going to run auto flowers now?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the other option Of getting
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to get clones from a friend
from a dispensary somewhere online a clone
[SPEAKER_00]: vendor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they fall out of the sky I don't
know allegedly how you get your clones But
[SPEAKER_00]: here are things to think about when you
get those clones Make sure you treat them
[SPEAKER_00]: for every bug and pathogen and pest and
mold Possible think that those bugs those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants have got every plant disease you
could imagine and treat them for it
[SPEAKER_00]: isolate them Don't put them near the rest
of your plants clean them up and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: thing to think about is when you get
clones Is that clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, is it really what you think
it is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it legitimately properly labeled?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the second thing to think about is
somebody else Fino hunted that clone for
[SPEAKER_00]: you now that may be great for you but I
like different things than you like and
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike likes different things than I like
and Clint likes different things than Mike
[SPEAKER_00]: likes and but we all like similar things
But I don't want to rely on another person
[SPEAKER_00]: to Fino hunt my outdoor product for me
That's something that I would like to do
[SPEAKER_00]: myself So unless you really trust the
person that did that selection for you You
[SPEAKER_00]: may not get the ideal phenotype that
you're hoping for it may be great for them
[SPEAKER_00]: in their region in their environment and
their state and their climate and their
[SPEAKER_00]: garden in their Situation everything will
be different just a few miles away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are going to be drastically
different So maybe that phenotype was
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect for them, but it's not going to be
perfect for you That is something to think
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's move forward a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking about the right plant
for you Think about selecting the right
[SPEAKER_00]: plants for your region things to think
about is will it finish on time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it too hot or too cold in your
environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it too dry or too humid in your
environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does your environment have does it
commonly get powdery mildew in your
[SPEAKER_00]: environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you grown outdoors the last couple of
years?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know people who have grown outdoors
in your region in the last few years?
[SPEAKER_00]: What did they experience what problems
pass past the pathogens?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they experience do they get powdery
mildew?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they get a certain kind of bug at a
certain time of the year?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you talk to the farmers in your area,
they will already know what you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: prepare for So maybe find the other ganja
farmers in your area join the groups join
[SPEAKER_00]: the community and find out what is coming
Also talk to the other farmers the people
[SPEAKER_00]: that are just growing normal conventional
crops the lettuce farmers the carrot
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers I don't know what they're growing
in your neighborhood, but talk to them and
[SPEAKER_00]: see what should I expect this year?
[SPEAKER_00]: They will let you know now is the time to
start researching and selecting plants
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to handle those conditions
those problems and that environment
[SPEAKER_00]: properly You will see on some breeders
websites that they do say these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: handle powdery mildew these plants Are
great in this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are great in this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see things like that on my
website and many other breeders websites
[SPEAKER_00]: So start doing your research also go see
what other growers in your area are
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you need the same strains Maybe
there's a reason why everybody in that
[SPEAKER_00]: area chooses that same clone because it
does very well there There's probably a
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder in your area that is producing
seeds that has been producing seeds for
[SPEAKER_00]: Generations after generation in that area
to make the perfect strain for that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe you need to find the breeder In
your area that's got the crop for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that the things I breed here work
very well here Of course, they're being
[SPEAKER_00]: bred here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I spread them out to my friends
grows here, we have great success There's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably somebody like that in your area
Now here's something I always want to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about when it comes to planting outdoors
First of all, I should say follow the
[SPEAKER_00]: rules follow the laws if you're gonna
plant outdoors know how many plants you
[SPEAKER_00]: can put out there know if they've got to
be under lock and key behind a fence if
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got to be hidden that is up to you
I'm Not your legal counsel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the guy teaching you how to produce
high quality cannabis Do not get yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: or me in trouble while you were doing that
now that being said follow your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: count follow all the rules, but always
plant extra You're gonna lose some you're
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely most likely probably going to
lose some of your outdoor crop You're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to lose some to weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to lose some to bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to lose some to animals There
are also thieves and then maybe even law
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement and then hopefully after all
Of that at the bottom of the list,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you're on the list and you'll get
some cannabis at the end of this for
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself But make sure you plant extra
Because here here where we are we always
[SPEAKER_00]: lose a couple of plants I had a friend who
had a big outdoor grow in his backyard and
[SPEAKER_00]: every year the plant right there at the
corner and that plant right there at the
[SPEAKER_00]: back corner Those would be the first two
to disappear and when those started
[SPEAKER_00]: getting cut down by the thieves We knew
that was when it was time for us to get
[SPEAKER_00]: out there and actually start harvesting
our crop So I've had plants stolen from my
[SPEAKER_00]: backyards before that's why I don't even
bother To grow outdoor cannabis here.
[SPEAKER_00]: My neighbors are 20 feet that way and 20
feet that way and probably 40 feet that
[SPEAKER_00]: way They can all see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fences are real low.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna disappear around here So
there's no point in growing outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis here The thieves are gonna come
get it but make sure that you plant extra
[SPEAKER_00]: because like I said bugs animals weather
thieves cops Who knows what else could go
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be a great flood I don't even
want to wish I don't want to jinx you and
[SPEAKER_00]: send other shit your way but plant extra
and plan ahead Outdoor can be as simple or
[SPEAKER_00]: as elaborate as you want to make it It
could be as easy as putting some pots
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors or you could really prep the soil
build a bunch of structure build a
[SPEAKER_00]: watering system It is up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beauty of it is that Sun is so amazing
that Sun is free and it is out there So
[SPEAKER_00]: you should take advantage of that if
you've got this space and the legal means
[SPEAKER_00]: to do so It's all about how much effort
you want to spend into it But the first
[SPEAKER_00]: things I would think about definitely are
good genetics if you don't have good
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics for outdoors or not go you may
not even make it all the way to harvest or
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest time may come and your plants
might not even be finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be snowing on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe Halloween here in Colorado It snows
almost every year on Halloween The joke is
[SPEAKER_00]: that you've got to base your Halloween
costume around your jacket and around the
[SPEAKER_00]: snow So I rock the Chewbacca costume.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always nice and warm, but it's going
to snow Maybe your plants won't even be
[SPEAKER_00]: done by then if you have not selected the
appropriate genetics So choose the right
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics then the next step The next thing
I would think about is probably amending
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil The soil is where the plants are
going to get their energy their life their
[SPEAKER_00]: food their nutrients That's coming from
the soil unless you plan on feeding your
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor crop bottled nutrients I would
really invest in amending the soil good
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done several podcasts with Jesse I've
done a lot of other outdoor episodes and
[SPEAKER_00]: also follow build a soil if you really
want to know about building a good outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and Getting your products affordably
and getting them shipped right to your
[SPEAKER_00]: door build a soil does not pay me anything
for that I just know it's a great company
[SPEAKER_00]: and they've got all the shit that you're
gonna need So build a good soil get that
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor soil going then something else I
would definitely consider is something to
[SPEAKER_00]: cover your outdoor plants from storms here
in Colorado We get a hail storm right in
[SPEAKER_00]: the middle of the summer It's gonna be a
super nice day and then you're gonna look
[SPEAKER_00]: up and it's gonna be dark as shit up in
the sky The clouds are gonna be all
[SPEAKER_00]: rolling around and look crazy and you're
gonna see lightning in about 40 seconds
[SPEAKER_00]: after that There's gonna be hail the size
of golf balls and grapefruits get the fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors Cover your car get your car in the
garage bring the dog inside But now what
[SPEAKER_00]: about the ganja plants now is the time
before we put those plants outdoors To
[SPEAKER_00]: start thinking about that hail storm the
rainstorm the crazy winds we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get I don't know what comes your way I
don't know where you are, but you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: get some bullshit weather It's their
plants are gonna be out there June July
[SPEAKER_00]: August September, maybe October Maybe even
into later than that if you depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're gonna do They're gonna be out
there for five six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get it At least one two,
maybe five or six terrible fucking nights
[SPEAKER_00]: of weather be prepared for that Let's
build something to cover these plants from
[SPEAKER_00]: the hail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's build something to protect them from
the rain Let's build a way to protect them
[SPEAKER_00]: from the crazy winds that do come up Be
prepared and expect that don't act
[SPEAKER_00]: surprised when it fucking hails on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to happen That's what nature
does Especially when we all put a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: ganja plants outside nature goes you think
so motherfucker And it just drops all the
[SPEAKER_00]: ice trays right on your head and laughs at
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way nature works So be prepared
plan ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before set yourself up for
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know the storm is coming We know
that the animals are coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know the bugs are coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know the weather is coming We know that
a thief is going to think about it be
[SPEAKER_00]: prepared for all of this shit you guys So
I would focus on getting good genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: then I would amend that soil Then I would
definitely work on something to cover and
[SPEAKER_00]: protect those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ruins people's crops I've seen people
lose entire summers worth of work in one
[SPEAKER_00]: night due to a hail storm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that you should definitely
think about in your outdoor garden and
[SPEAKER_00]: planning your outdoor garden early is
Integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to do to keep bugs away
from your garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is going to show up in your area?
[SPEAKER_00]: We all run the risk of spider mites
whiteflies fungus gnats here in Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: in my region we get a lot of caterpillars
that turn into beetles or they turn into
[SPEAKER_00]: Caterpillars they turn into these little
moths they turn and they lay these weird
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoons inside of the buds and then they
break open They have these little orange
[SPEAKER_00]: their melon worms or something They turn
into these orange fucking worms and they
[SPEAKER_00]: eat your weed and then if you smoke those
orange worms you get high as giraffe pussy
[SPEAKER_00]: But I haven't done that since like high
school.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't do that shit anymore But think
about your integrated pest management
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy not only insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to get rabbits?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you gonna get deer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a possibility of bear?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's cats think about all of that
shit and how to Humanely keep them away
[SPEAKER_00]: from the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not hurt any of the animals the bugs
the natural Life that was there that land
[SPEAKER_00]: that was there was there before you it is
yours now to grow on but in the future I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know whose it will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please take good care of that land for
the future generations Maybe you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you don't somebody's gonna have to
deal with that land in the future Please
[SPEAKER_00]: don't fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also something else I should mention when
we're using our pesticides or integrated
[SPEAKER_00]: pest management Keep your neighbors in
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not destroy or damage or ruin their
side of the fence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that shit in mind Let's not destroy
any of the nature around us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's uh Let's improve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we have to get rid of some bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to be safe We have to protect our
crop, but be respectful to the environment
[SPEAKER_00]: that is around you So with that being said
find an ideal humane way to keep rabbits
[SPEAKER_00]: chickens dogs cats goats deer bear I don't
know what is in your neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's a crazy pasta.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you got spider monkeys I don't know
what is there but Figure out a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: safely and humanely keep them away from
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also think about thieves We need to keep
thieves away from our plants I would never
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend hurting anybody for your ganja
plants You will go to jail if you hurt
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody protecting your ganja plants
depending on what state you're in You
[SPEAKER_00]: could very well go to jail for defending
your criminal enterprise, which is your
[SPEAKER_00]: ganja plant So think about what you're
gonna do if somebody comes into that yard
[SPEAKER_00]: one night to take your plants also keep in
mind You've got bait out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were never entering a criminal
enterprise or this sort of realm before
[SPEAKER_00]: but now you've got a very Profitable a
cash crop a very valuable commodity in
[SPEAKER_00]: your backyard and people may want that
think about that before you enter this
[SPEAKER_00]: Endeavor here before you even put those
plants out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I've said this before It is my
responsibility as just a good friend and
[SPEAKER_00]: as a podcaster to remind you think about
law enforcement Is it legal to grow where
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing if it's not legal to grow
where you're growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you ready to face those?
[SPEAKER_00]: Consequences which whatever may happen
then whatever may come from it now you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna say no one's gonna know How are they
gonna know this shit happens, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe recently my basement flooded and I
had to have plumbers and fucking people
[SPEAKER_00]: down in my basement near where my Grow
space is luckily.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's legal here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only got a few fucking plants I just
straight up showed them because it was
[SPEAKER_00]: easier to be like hey, here's this in here
Please don't go in this room and they all
[SPEAKER_00]: looked and they said oh there's plants and
it was out of the way I just showed them,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I mean here just lift up my
dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me let you take a peek that way They
weren't curious, but I've got my illegal
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of plants down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nothing crazy They went huh and they
were bored with it, but maybe it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: legal where you are So maybe one day the
gas guy comes to check the gas meter or
[SPEAKER_00]: the water meter or the electrical meter or
maybe there's a fucking cop Helicopter
[SPEAKER_00]: just happens to randomly fly over your
backyard Maybe your neighbors get in a
[SPEAKER_00]: fight and then the cops go to the
neighbor's house and they're in the
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard Just talking and they go what's
that over the fence?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a big-ass weed plant think about
all of the shit that could go wrong I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want anything to go wrong for you
But I want you to be prepared for it
[SPEAKER_00]: because shit has gone wrong for me And I
wish that somebody would have warned me
[SPEAKER_00]: the bullshit that I could have gotten
myself into so just being a bro Trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: help you out think about it if it's not
completely legal where you are weigh your
[SPEAKER_00]: options Legally probably I should say
don't fucking do it, but you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: Grown-ass adult and I recommend that every
grown adult does what the fuck they want
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be governed by Rasta Jeff or the
government if that's how you feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right Let me get myself back on strong
track here integrated pest management plan
[SPEAKER_00]: for every bug imaginable plan for every
pest animal problem pathogen imaginable
[SPEAKER_00]: then also prepare for thieves and Prepare
for law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you want to deal with them is up
to you I should also say that booby traps
[SPEAKER_00]: are highly illegal if you set up some sort
of booby traps in your grow in your yard
[SPEAKER_00]: in your space and somebody else Gets hurt,
especially a law enforcement officer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were in deep shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get sued You're gonna go
to jail if you own the property you're in
[SPEAKER_00]: extra trouble If you're just a renter the
homeowner may also be in some trouble with
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
