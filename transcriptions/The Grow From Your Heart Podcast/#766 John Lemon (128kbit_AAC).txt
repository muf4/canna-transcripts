[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably hear it in my throat
and my voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing a lot better now.

[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to have such a good community
behind me supporting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you can hear it still a little
bit of funk in the throat and the lungs,
[SPEAKER_00]: but way better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ears don't sound so gooey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll stop giving updates in an episode or
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm glad I'm feeling better because
fish is coming to Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite band on the planet is fish and
they are doing four nights at Dick's
[SPEAKER_00]: sporting goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the giant soccer field and commerce
are in a commerce city there in Denver,
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado, a commerce city just outside of
Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean, but fish has come in
and I will be at all four nights of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fish concerts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are there, please come say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a high five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shake my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a fist bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When after an event, people email me and
they say, Hey bro, I saw you at the fish
[SPEAKER_00]: concerts, but I did not come say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: Come say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fish concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all bros.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, don't talk while fish is playing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a general rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't talk to me while fish is playing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Save it for set break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Save it for right after the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a high five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just say hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ignore me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to say, Hey bro,
I saw you there and ignored you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a community kind of dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say what's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may just may have some seeds in my back
pocket, especially if I can sneak them
[SPEAKER_00]: through security on the first night.
[SPEAKER_00]: If first night goes easy, we'll take more
every night.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the fish ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please join me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say hi at the fish show.

here, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the badass motherfucking web guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been keeping this dude busy for the
past week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm the only project he's had time
to work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting iredirect going and compliant with
the credit card compliance setup was kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of a challenge, so we got that going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Web dude, shout out, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe you one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I already sent you a gift pack,
but that took longer than anticipated,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I owe you another one, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what I could do for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been rambling for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The show's getting long already.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't even talked about the main
topic of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main topic of this show is my new
strain or one of my newest strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is called John Lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you've seen me post maybe you
haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you have seen me post pictures of
it to social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow me on Instagram, irey underscore
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check me out on Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, irey underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join the Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all over social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Search irey genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot miss me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been posting pictures lately of a
plant that I am calling John Lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about John Lemon for just a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: A quick description is that John Lemon
smells like sour skunks and diesel field.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing you're going to hear me say
a lot here is sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is stupid sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd almost got a lot of names with the
word sour or sour in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my East Coast friends,
but I don't say sour, and there's enough
[SPEAKER_00]: sour out there, so I wanted to go with the
creative name.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will talk about why it got that name.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aroma makes my eyes feel itchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always talked about sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has this weird effect on my eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The John Lemon has that same like,
I don't know, it's almost like an allergy
[SPEAKER_00]: effect, but in a good way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could tell when someone's got some sour
diesel or John Lemon in the car,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the room, that makes my eyes get this
itch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real deal East Coast sour diesel
stinks so bad that I said in the car,
[SPEAKER_00]: it stinks so bad you can't hide it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could double bag it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could put it in a jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could put it in a bag inside of a jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to vacuum seal it or something,
or we are going to smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That East Coast sour diesel, the real deal
diesel, is a super fucking stinker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot hide that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you do open the bag at a party
or in the car especially, everybody knows
[SPEAKER_00]: what you've got right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, bro, he's got the fire and they all
come congregating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to be careful if you got that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it double bagged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful where you open it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't even open it in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot open the real deal sour diesel
or the John Lemon for that matter in the
[SPEAKER_00]: car because it will stink up the car so
bad that it smells like you smoked in
[SPEAKER_00]: there for the next week even if you don't
light it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just open the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let your friend smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Close it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That car is now stank.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will never smell the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to burn some hippie incense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drop some osium in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vacuum that shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke a cigarette in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still going to stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So East Coast sour diesel, it's a super
stinky plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those stink traits definitely
come through in this cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have some notes that I try to stay on
track because I get quite rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: East Coast sour diesel grows tall with
thick dense buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about the parents of the
plants here, kind of giving you an idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: why I made this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buzz from sour D is super aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I smoke that one, my eyes get super
heavy and I get this weird like tunnel
[SPEAKER_00]: vision, isolated sort of a feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I get sort of a heart racing
sort of a feeling but it's definitely in
[SPEAKER_00]: my own head introspective, introvert kind
of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to talk to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to be left the fuck alone
because I'm trying to figure out the
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning of life and a Rubik's Cube all at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what that one does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the lemon skunk male
that I used in this cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I should mention this is not
the lemon skunk that I used in Lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeffrey and Firefly and all the other
lemon stuff that you've heard about in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not the same lemon skunk that is a
lemon skunk female.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this situation, I am using a male lemon
skunk plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a BC lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has been around for a while from
the BC seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my hands on a great lemon skunk
male that does great things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It adds great vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It adds great shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: It adds great potency and most of all,
it adds a really amazing lemon flavor to
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know how I like that lemon turp.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is packed up with lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a beautiful structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The node spacing is really nice on this
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lemon skunk female, the node spacing is
kind of far.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's more of a compact structure
compared to that lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a giant top flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes really sturdy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can hold themselves up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That other lemon skunk is kind of floppy
and needs supports.
[SPEAKER_00]: The male is more sturdy, more robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can hold itself up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: This lemon skunk makes offspring that reek
of lemons and they are stupid potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not take the lemon skunk and the sour
diesel, the East Coast sour diesel and put
[SPEAKER_00]: those together and see what we could come
up with and the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, before we get there, let's talk
about why did I name it John Lemon?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's next here on the notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did I make it John Lemon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, John Lemon was recommended to me
by somebody on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember who did that exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were so many names given and so many
things to keep track of.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you recommended it and you think you
were first, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a prize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out for the great name.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the name is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am honestly not a huge Beatles or John
Lennon and definitely not a Yoko Ono fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy Chris in high school,
shout out to Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're well, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a huge Beatles fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to listen to the Beatles all the
time in the car with Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: He chose the Beatles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Robbie chose Pink Floyd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg chose the Grateful Dead and I chose
Fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of like how we picked our
favorite bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody got their own band, but I wasn't
the Beatles guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Beatles are cool, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think I'm saying that I hate the
Beatles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just not the one I would have
chose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have chose the Grateful Dead or
Fish over the Beatles any day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Pink Floyd's kind of boring to me,
to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm going to get hate mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have fun in the comments section.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it on down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when somebody said John Lennon,
I thought it was a great name because
[SPEAKER_00]: we've all seen John Lennon in front of the
Statue of Liberty in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: That brought me to the New York vibes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not from New York, but he made it
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've got the lemon flavor brings
in the lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's John, lemon, John Lennon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a beautiful play on words.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I heard it, could not resist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to resist for a long time,
but I kept coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a list of names and I kept going
this John Lennon right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be the one, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's my decision overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I chose John Lennon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's segue into talking about flavor
and aroma or terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you will, this one's got a lot of great
flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to hear me say the word sour
a lot because this one is dominated by
[SPEAKER_00]: sour flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a backup of a backup of lemon
flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a backup of some skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's hints of maybe some cat piss,
some ammonia in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's talk about some of the aromas
and flavors that will come from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be mostly sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: The BC lemon skunk I use makes everything
tastes like strong, sour lemons that the
[SPEAKER_00]: lemon skunk on the other plants I use is
kind of a softer lemonade kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: lemons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is more just straight up non
diluted, sour, ripe lemons in your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemons like if you get that plastic lemon
with the juice and squeeze it on your
[SPEAKER_00]: tongue, you make that pucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's this kind of lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the sour diesel adds a definitely a
diesel aroma to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's that diesel funk to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it also adds sort of a an astringent
sort of a cat piss, sort of a really sharp
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma, maybe ammonia to it, to the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the phenotypes are very sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the other phenotypes are going to
have a little bit of lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are going to have some diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants will even have a little bit of
fuel and skunk terps to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get a little bit of cat piss and
ammonia in some, but you're mainly going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get sour, straight sour and lemons,
but you're mostly going to get sour,
[SPEAKER_00]: sour fuel, sour ammonia, maybe some sour
cat piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds disgusting, but if you're a
cannabis smoker, you know that that sour
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel cat piss aroma with lemons mixed
into it is going to be amazing and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know the buzz will be high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you smoke something like that,
the buzz is just straight to the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: My eyes go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get kind of anxious.
[SPEAKER_00]: My heart starts racing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The armpits get sweaty.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I love when I smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's talk about the buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I feel like this one goes
right to the face, right to the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh gosh, when I smoke it,
my eyes go, oh, there it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they get all droopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: My face gets warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I got my temperature raises.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pits get sweaty.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heart starts racing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember where I put my
sunglasses, but I'm probably wearing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't figure out where I put my phone,
but I'm probably playing with my phone and
[SPEAKER_00]: can't find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the kind of buzz that the John
Lemon gives to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we've talked a lot about the
smoking effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of you here are here to grow this
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about the growing
characteristics of John Lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the things I breed take a little
bit to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend letting these go for
about 70 days, maybe a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say 10 weeks is average and standard for
this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be some shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: There definitely may be some longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the best phenotypes finish around
10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants that take a little bit longer
are definitely the lemon skunk leaners and
[SPEAKER_00]: they definitely get super potent and super
lemony, but I don't want all that lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want more of the sour in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer the 10-weekers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to play with those longer
finishers, I encourage you to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Expect tall plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants will triple in size before
they are finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, triple.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your grow space is only six feet tall,
start flowering around two feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Save some space for the light also that
may mess you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lemon skunk phenotype will get tall
quickly and it gets taller and it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit thinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sour diesel phenotype will spread out
a little bit more and not get as tall as
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice it does more branching,
more spreading out, more lateral growth
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of just straight going straight
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those long arms do fill in with fat
colas on both phenotypes if you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: clean them up too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us do too much lollipopping and
pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one that I recommend pruning and
lollipopping a little bit less.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you let all those little balls grow,
they will fill in and that will make one
[SPEAKER_00]: giant nugget all the way up the branches
will be big fat colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't take too much off,
so leave a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the bottom buds on these plants will
get frosty and dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're getting just a little bit of
light, they'll fill in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually most of the time when I'm
talking about growing, I recommend and
[SPEAKER_00]: suggest a heavy defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not with these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going to defoliate your John
lemon, go medium, maybe just a little
[SPEAKER_00]: above medium, but do not go hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't reply well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't react well, respond well to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get hate mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll tell you they're pissed off for
the next week or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't recover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go light with the defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go light to medium, maybe medium,
hard medium at the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Popping and twisting is okay with these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will take it very well and it does
slow down that vertical growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as you throw them into flower,
maybe even a week before flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: pop and twist all those stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as they recover about 14,
21 days, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pop and twist again or do it in more
spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more space to pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pop and twist, keep popping.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will keep growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll slow them down from going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll keep growing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get wider.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get stockier and they will recover
from that before they start flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got more notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do react well to topping,
but I wouldn't recommend topping them too
[SPEAKER_00]: many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one top kind of low to make all
those lower branches meet because these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants will make one giant top cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't take it out, take that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the bottoms will meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll meet right up to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't go more than one top.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not like the screen of green method very
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't like to be trellised and
manipulated and pulled around too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually do a screen when they're low to
spread them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these plants like to go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a screen on them and pull them down
to make them go out and then I can shape
[SPEAKER_00]: them the way I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, I don't do a lot of
manipulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time I'll do some weaving and
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weave the arms in where I want them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with these plants, I realize they
probably grow better if I don't weave them
[SPEAKER_00]: into the net.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do minimal trellising.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a spreader and I do a supporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of your plants are going to get
really tall really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend at least that support net
or maybe some sticks or tomato cages or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that because they are going
to get tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the phenotypes will be very
robust and turgid and be able to hold
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them will need supports,
especially when they start developing big,
[SPEAKER_00]: fat, chunky, frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just exaggerating big, beautiful buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are going to need some supports
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I have noticed is that these
plants do eat a lot of nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times they'll run out of nitrogen
kind of early.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a good way to prevent that is to
continue your veg feed a couple of weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times we just cut out that veg
nutrient right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We quit giving it nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We switch right to the bloom newts on day
one of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants will run out of nitrogen or
have the opportunity or are likely to run
[SPEAKER_00]: out of nitrogen if you do things that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend giving them just a big
hit of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will benefit and they will appreciate
it and respond better if you give them
[SPEAKER_00]: lower doses of nitrogen later into the
flowering phase, maybe all the way up to
[SPEAKER_00]: day 14, maybe even a little later.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will start burning out of nitrogen
and they do grow for 10, maybe more weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do run out of nitrogen,
you can foliar feed them, feed them your
[SPEAKER_00]: base nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will help.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you start seeing it, it will be a
chase and a race because they will eat a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna start throwing everything
else out of whack also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give them some nitrogen early in
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't cut that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit about
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always everybody's favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give my disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody always asks, not everybody,
a lot of people ask, what's your favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype or what phenotype would you
pick?
[SPEAKER_00]: That phenotype popped up in my garden and
it was perfect for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not even pop up in your garden
since you've got different lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: air, water, soil, microbes, nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different love, different music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is different in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not even see the same phenotypes
that I have because a phenotype is an
[SPEAKER_00]: expression based on an environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have the same environment,
you may not even get the same expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's step one of talking about
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other part is when I select a
phenotype, I'm selecting it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's who I want to smoke, grow,
breed, take pictures of, smell it,
[SPEAKER_00]: look at it for the next year or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the plant I'm working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like picking your date.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want me to select your date?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to describe phenotype selection
kind of like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several lines to pick from.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have agreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want lemons.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want diesel feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you pick John Lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in my mind, we've got it narrowed down
pretty damn close to what we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to compare this to, we've all
decided that we want Italian food.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all now driven to the Italian
restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're going to call John
Lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just got weird and it became Italian
food, but follow along.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will all make sense in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we get to the Italian restaurant,
they're going to pass us a menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that menu is going to be nine different
kinds of pasta.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll probably be an eggplant dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be a bunch of other great shit in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want the white sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want the garlic sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going for the red sauce today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually do the white sauce, but I
already assigned it to somebody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all want different sauces, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is kind of what I think it's like
when we're selecting phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all decided we want Italian food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's up to you to pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want the marinara or if you want
the garlic sauce or if you want the white
[SPEAKER_00]: sauce, I've driven you to the Italian
restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got you that far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phenotype selection, I don't want to
choose off the menu for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to open up the menu and see
which one gets your opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phenotype I'm going to select is great
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The meal I'm going to select is perfect
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to order the right shit for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to order totally different
shit and that's how your phenotype may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want the one that takes a long time to
finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want that 10-weeker, but generally I
want a long sativa dominant, longer
[SPEAKER_00]: finishing, longer flowering plant with a
lot of flavor that gets me wrecked when I
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke it, that's got a certain shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really care too much about the
colors and the certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not growing it for Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it to be potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need it to be resistant to pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it to not be intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really need it to handle problems and
bugs well because I'm going to breed to
[SPEAKER_00]: it, make market seeds out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a different criteria than you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want one that grows short and
tastes like chocolate and has an indica
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant buzz and puts you on the couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So me telling you which phenotype to
select doesn't do either one of us any
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, we've driven to the Italian
restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the Italian dish in there that is the
best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with that being said, let's talk about
some of the phenotypical expressions I
[SPEAKER_00]: have experienced in my test growers and my
friends growing these strains have
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is the sour phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is the more sour phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the phenotypes are sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main difference, some is going to have
more diesel than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some is going to have, so the main
difference is the growth structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about the flavors and I've
already talked about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll touch on that again in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main difference is the growth
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sour D phenotype kind of creeps
outward.
[SPEAKER_00]: It branches out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets a little bit wider.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lemon skunk phenotype gets a little
bit taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't grow out as wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't need as much space between
plants, but it's going to get taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need more vertical space for that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other differences, like I mentioned
before, are flavors and aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are things that you'll notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you start flowering,
you may notice some of these differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I notice is some of my favorite
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you give it a little stem rub and smell
your fingers, it is cat piss and ammonia
[SPEAKER_00]: and I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's stay on track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got notes in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The background aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's sour and lemons.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the main ingredient, the main
aromas you're going to smell here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour is just overwhelmingly kind of gross
sour and then you've got lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just fresh ripe lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, oh, that's grossly good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lemons, oh, gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make a pucker face and you smell it
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there are background and backup
aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those are like diesel fuel or
gasoline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's skunk in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them smell like sour skunk gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we've got things like I've been
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ammonia, cat piss and real astringent
flavors like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one of them that randomly throws
out a little bit of lavender turps and I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know where that comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I've noticed though that I think
that medium and feed really play a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in the flavors and aromas of
this cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I grow it in soilless mix,
it tastes pretty similar, pretty much the
[SPEAKER_00]: same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I put it in cocoa, it tastes
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: When my friends grow it in living soil,
it really brings out that lavender sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It brought out sort of a floral turp that
I could not quite describe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still had that main sour thing to it,
but there was something at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a really sensitive palate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can really identify things I like to
think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I seem to have proven that theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was a lavender sweetness at the
end of it and he runs organic living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that seemed to bring that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, that is my report on John
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I rushed through that one kind
of quickly.
