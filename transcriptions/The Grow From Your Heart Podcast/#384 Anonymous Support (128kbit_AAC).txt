[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode 384 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is brought to you by the
Hella Dank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need new seeds for your garden,
I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company and you can find them at www
.dankseed.store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start the podcast off by letting
you know what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I've been taking dabs of Wi-Fi
Ambrosia from Apothecary Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked this up at the Pueblo location.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label says it is 82.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally like to buy a concentrate that
lifts me up and makes my head kind of spin
[SPEAKER_00]: and makes me super high.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Wi-Fi is the exact opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was like a punch in the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made me sit back in the chair,
made my eyes super heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made my body nice and heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some chilling out medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some nighttime medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably, if you've got some super
heavy pain, this would probably knock your
[SPEAKER_00]: pain out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just trying to get nice and
stoned and nice and mellow, this would be
[SPEAKER_00]: a perfect get stoned and sink into the
couch kind of concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big up to the Wi-Fi Ambrosia and a big
shout out to our friends at Apothecary
[SPEAKER_00]: Farms in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last Thursday I had Mike on the show and
we talked about the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike was super fired up and wanted to talk
all night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I left the microphones on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kept talking for a really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only posted the first 36 minutes of the
conversation that Mike and I had last
[SPEAKER_00]: week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this episode will be the remainder of
that conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into the rest of the
podcast, make sure you follow Mike on
[SPEAKER_00]: Twitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at Nemopunk15.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also make sure you support Mike on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find his Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
smokers and growers, let's welcome White
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike back to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a very good friend who checks
out my Instagram live feeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sends me some emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a really good supporter of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's on the IRE Army.
[SPEAKER_00]: He asked us, what is a good way that he
can support cannabis legalization in his
[SPEAKER_00]: area?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's kind of a businessy person.
[SPEAKER_00]: He needs to maintain anonymity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say that word for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anonymity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anonymity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never tried to say that out loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't snap a picture of the comment
because it was an Instagram live,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it was something to the effect of how
do I keep the corporate suit and tie job
[SPEAKER_01]: in a prohibition state and still fight to
legalize cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the answer is very carefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been where you are now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember being in it started,
oddly enough, I pulled the fucking topic
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the hat in seventh grade debate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did the class project where you write
down a topic and throw it in the hat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you pull out the topic and you
pull, you have to fucking debate whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: side of the argument you pull.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just about to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had debate class in school and was
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: You did not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis was the subject that you had to
debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to, I had to be the pro use
marijuana while you're pregnant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was, that was my argument that I had
to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole nother podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to get some ladies to come on the
show and talk about that and nobody wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to come on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Hey ladies, if you're out there and
you'd like to be on a podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about using cannabis during
pregnancy, pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to find one lady who was pro and
one lady who was con and then maybe it was
[SPEAKER_00]: some medical profession that could come on
and talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe, uh, is that OBGYN?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that who I need to talk about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pregnancy doctor?
[SPEAKER_00]: You wanted them to come on, tell me what
you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to say no, but still want
their presence just for their voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll CNN them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time they get gone, I'll just turn
them their fucking mic like, like I do
[SPEAKER_00]: when Mike's coffin, just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just shut off his mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm trying to ramble on cause you're
purple and you're sweaty and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: coughing, but eventually the listeners are
going to catch on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just fucking talking out of my ass so
that you can cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear the words?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hard to talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I don't have any clue what we're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a couple of seconds ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, how do, uh, for our friend,
how to, so how to keep his job brought
[SPEAKER_01]: this story up is because I've been forced
to debate this topic since long before I
[SPEAKER_01]: was comfortable with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so take your time, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trolling you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it wasn't a totally high story.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dab came at a bad time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's really purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's really as purple and that was a
little dad too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a, I was worried about it being too
cold because I've kind of gunked up the
[SPEAKER_01]: nail the night doing too cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Went a little hot, but, uh, that first
experience with debating cannabis taught
[SPEAKER_01]: me a couple of really useful things.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, the real trick to debating any topic
is doing your research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two, if you take a controversial topic and
decide to stand up and talk about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: be prepared to get a lot of people
laughing at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just something that you have to
take from the first, um, like there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: famous quote.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I think it's Gandhi or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, first they laugh at you or like
first they ignore you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they laugh at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they fight you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you win.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but like the laughing's a long time
usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you go back to like, and there will
always be laughers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you go back to like 96,
um, 98, 2000 and look at how cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: advocates, um, even advocates from like
the national organization for the reform
[SPEAKER_01]: of marijuana as normal, when they're heavy
hitting lawyers would go give press
[SPEAKER_01]: releases or put out statements or talk to
the press, the anchor would be laughing in
[SPEAKER_01]: their face.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, this is a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a degree from a good university.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have 20 years experience in their
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an educated, informed opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just laughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Laughing at them, but we've passed that
point in history now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if like, as long as you're in the
U S this is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, depending on which country you're
listening from, this might not be very
[SPEAKER_01]: true for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully it's truer than it was 10 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but as far as the U S goes,
if you start talking about pro
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization topics in an informed manner,
you're not going to get met with laughter
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you'll still get ignored and people
will fight you, but the laughter is pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: much gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because a lot of what's not
funny has been made abundantly clear over
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The disparities in arrest rates,
um, what the black market is capable of
[SPEAKER_01]: doing with 30 or 40 billion a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, it's an amount of money that's
almost inconceivable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there's a good, uh, meme going around.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like the difference between a
million seconds and a billion seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like one's like 11 hours and the other
one's like 30 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I got all of those numbers wrong,
but if you look it up, the disparity is
[SPEAKER_01]: huge and it's, it's so big that most
people don't understand how big it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that amount of money in the black
market, like the cosmetics industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: all makeup is only 35 billion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's huge and all of that's
underground and the amount of people that
[SPEAKER_01]: employees, um, the amount of disputes that
creates the amount of taxes that could get
[SPEAKER_01]: paid on all that, like all of those are
things that people re kind of understand
[SPEAKER_01]: at least a little bit now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I started doing this,
none of that shit existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have the seed to sale model.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have examples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, when we were talking about legalizing
marijuana five, six years ago here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado, people were like, what does that
look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Blank stares were all anyone had.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, anyone in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The closest model we had was the medical
marijuana dispensary models that were
[SPEAKER_00]: starting here and in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one of the biggest problems Cali's
had this year is they ignored their
[SPEAKER_01]: medical market from 96 to like 2015.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in all that time, the market,
didn't ignore itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grew, evolved, changed, fell apart,
got rated, rebuilt itself countless times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that they finally tried to settle
down and regulate and license this whole
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of giant monster that they've ignored
for 20 years, it's nearly impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, with all the grandfathering in and you
know, how can this place not meet the new
[SPEAKER_01]: rules?
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been open for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mayor was at their ribbon cutting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love these people.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can they be illegal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there's a lot of that right now and
it all has to do with just ignoring it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the upside for people still living
in prohibition land is by now,
[SPEAKER_01]: even in places like Arkansas, Texas,
Tennessee, Virginia, there are already
[SPEAKER_01]: legislature, uh, members of the
legislature, the state Senate,
[SPEAKER_01]: governors, um, city council, people
actively talking about marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, even the ones that are against it,
are currently thinking about if it happens
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway, how do we mitigate shit like DUIs
and teen access and, um, advertising and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're already willing to have a
conversation that they weren't willing to
[SPEAKER_01]: even think about five, seven years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they know it's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it's going to happen around them
one day if they're ready for it or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other big upside to this is you're no
longer the squeaky wheel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like all of the wheels are squeaking 60 to
70% statistically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, for someone who has a job that
they want to protect or a life they want
[SPEAKER_01]: to protect, um, to send an email to an
elected representative to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: hi, I'm a voter and I would like you to
support the legalization of cannabis in
[SPEAKER_01]: one way or another, um, medical access,
whatever the topic is in your area.
[SPEAKER_01]: To send that email is not opening yourself
up to any sort of blowback.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, these people receive a million emails
a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the, the amount of correspondence
they get from constituents and people
[SPEAKER_01]: around the country is just bananas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make up another email address.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't want to use it's a hundred
percent simple enough to create your own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's real easy to make it look like a
legitimate human being when you're not,
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's not an investigative
portion to sending your governor an email
[SPEAKER_01]: that says vote for legal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you send an email, that's like,
I'm going to eat you and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: tomorrow or I'm going to have to set your
house on fire or all you better look out
[SPEAKER_01]: different fucking story.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of investigative people
that will look into your shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you send an email that says,
um, my state's not currently looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I would love for you to be the elected
representative in our area to lead on this
[SPEAKER_01]: issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, or I'd like you to vote for something
that somebody else is proposing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do all of that without any sort of
fear of reprisal at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and people from all over the country
do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I email people that aren't my elected
representative at least twice a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, 2019 is going to be huge for cannabis,
uh, all sorts of states that don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: any sort of good cannabis laws right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're talking about doing it by,
uh, by legislature because they're scared
[SPEAKER_01]: the public's going to do it without them
and they want to get ahead and get out in
[SPEAKER_01]: front of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's like already a hundred or 200
cannabis bills up for debate in the coming
[SPEAKER_01]: year that we know about already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so odds are that the person that asked
this question and thousands like him are
[SPEAKER_01]: in a place where cannabis is already being
debated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so joining that conversation
through email or a phone call to your
[SPEAKER_01]: elected rep is very simple and you don't
have to worry about blowback.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if you want to increase the risk a
little bit, you can go to city council.
[SPEAKER_01]: And stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Odds are very good that unless your
company has business before the city
[SPEAKER_01]: council or your, um, county commission or
whatever governs the area you live in,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, that they don't follow that news.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unless you go and make a bunch of
noise, the odds that anyone outside of
[SPEAKER_01]: that room hears your message is pretty
slim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are televised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are on public TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a couple of fun instances.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where old family friends of my dad's that
live in the next city up the highway would
[SPEAKER_01]: watch our city council meetings for some
reason and saw me and called him and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: like, your kid's on TV and some old people
don't have anything to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's cable access.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is one of the free channels,
but, uh, the, the odds that your boss is
[SPEAKER_01]: watching that and that that's going to
blow back on you are, are slimmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the other option there is there's even
if you go talk publicly, there isn't in my
[SPEAKER_01]: experience, anyone confirming that you're
really Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can go sign up as Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go sign up as Paul, as long as
you're not like Elvis Presley bitch,
[SPEAKER_01]: like they're not going to check it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not even going to care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the guy that had to type in the names
that would pop up on the TV screen while
[SPEAKER_01]: you spoke always used to give me shit
because just out of nervousness,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would give a number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of my name every time I went up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he never knew if I was going to say
my first and my last, my first,
[SPEAKER_01]: my middle, my last, my middle,
my last, if I was going to add the junior.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to, that's why people are
like, how many fucking names does Mike
[SPEAKER_00]: have?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cause he's a junior.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes I throw out the first name
and the last, sometimes he skips it and
[SPEAKER_00]: goes with the middle and the last.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've heard him say both.
[SPEAKER_00]: It confused me the first time you said the
first, the real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, wait, you're a who?
[SPEAKER_01]: It made me laugh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause a couple of the people that were
trying to fight, um, our local cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: rags really thought I was three people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they thought there was, yeah,
all of my different names that I had
[SPEAKER_01]: happened to use on camera were different
people and they were like, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: brothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all look very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I think only one of them's got
earrings and a different one wears
[SPEAKER_01]: glasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, man, all you bitches are just
bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I only know two of the names.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm fucking lost on the third one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like Mike, Michael.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of variations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the guy who had to type in the names
would always kind of give me a look like,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I had it when you walked up,
I typed it in the one you use and now it's
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to on the fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start calling you Mr. Pink.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you don't have to, to even
really give your legal name there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, another option that I've actually had
people do in different campaigns is the
[SPEAKER_01]: official campaign will write a number of
op-eds or letters to the editor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like Charlotte's going to vote on
marijuana and we think you should for
[SPEAKER_01]: these reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote letters to the editor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of releasing that letter to the
editor is like from the weed corporation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have it go out as like from some
random person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it appears in the paper is like from
Bob Huxtable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just how it prints up in the
paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see this all the time on all sorts of
different topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'll, I'll know the person that
submitted it or um, no of them in the
[SPEAKER_01]: language in the article is something that
they're not capable of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So clearly you're submitting this on
behalf of someone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, that's another thing too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel free to write a letter to the editor
and you can submit it under whatever name
[SPEAKER_01]: you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, make sure you're whatever submitting
it on doesn't include your tagline at the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom on all your emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that would be awkward sent from Ross
to Jeff's iPhone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I mean, there's a bunch of
different ways you can stay anonymous.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can contribute financially to
different campaigns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, are you reading my fucking notes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just good ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: My thunder bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good ways to help the cause anonymously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you can have one to one conversations
are huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, like people would get really offended
a couple of years back when the comparison
[SPEAKER_01]: between the cannabis legalization movement
and the gay rights movements were being
[SPEAKER_01]: made.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the part of that argument that I
always, that always really rang true to me
[SPEAKER_01]: was it's the one to one conversations with
people that really end a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: nonsense stigma that society's thrown at
the topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know personally that sitting down
with my anti-cannabis family members and
[SPEAKER_01]: being like, Hey, why do you care?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You heard like it clearly hasn't ruined my
brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't fucked up my future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it hasn't made me antisocial.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of the shit they taught you in school
was true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all a lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the lie in motion right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just, the stigma just melts away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so family members that were staunchly
anti-cannabis now now call me and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: like, Oh my God, it's coming up my area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's, and that's from those one to one
conversations.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not really up for those,
you can always just submit letters to the
[SPEAKER_01]: editor in their favorite newspaper and
newspapers are dying for content and they
[SPEAKER_01]: hate having to pay people for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you send them letters for free
that take up ad space, as long as you
[SPEAKER_01]: follow whatever one or two rules they have
and your letter is not insane,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll print it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're talking about, I think we
should legalize weed a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That letter is going to get printed as
long as you don't use curse words and you
[SPEAKER_01]: stick to their word limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even ask them if they have a word
limit, go read some of the articles that
[SPEAKER_00]: do get printed, kind of use that as a
template.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go to any, um, go to any newspaper on
their website, click on the opinion
[SPEAKER_01]: section.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be a letters to the editor tab
and there will be an easy tab that tells
[SPEAKER_01]: you, would you like to submit a letter to
the editor?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you click on it, it tells you
everything you need to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them even bring up a little pop-up
box for you to write it and pass into
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and then it'll show you the characters
remaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they'll give you an email, um,
email address that you can submit it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do that little box where it lets
you submit it, copy it and paste it to a
[SPEAKER_00]: note file and save it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they don't publish it, send it back
in a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay on shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always recommend writing those in a
different, um, different program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Word or Google docs, whatever you're
using.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they, so that you can spell check
and, and um, grammar check and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything disappears occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your web browser will refresh and your
damn writing is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: But almost all of them have an email
address where you can email their opinion
[SPEAKER_01]: letter editor and they just, yep,
this, this guy didn't say any bad words.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not advocating genocide.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's under 250 words goes in the print
file, print, print, print every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go, how much fill do we need?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one, two, three, four, five,
six letters to the editor this week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take the top six off the stack and print
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it might take a couple of weeks,
but they print a lot of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had 20 letters to the editor printed
over my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know when they're you, I know when I
see them it, uh, and now almost all of
[SPEAKER_01]: those were printed under my name,
but, uh, it's, it's really not as
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult or scary as you think it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot options.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see the one you've underlined
repeatedly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to go ahead and do that one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, well vote vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the most obvious way you can do
your part to help legalize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's I've learned over the past few
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you and our other friend Wade
encouraged me very strongly to become a
[SPEAKER_00]: voter and it feels good to fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they made it super easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a little piece of paper comes to your
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: You unfold it, you call your friend that
knows a lot and you ask him to help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he explains shit and you go
Google it to make sure your friend's not
[SPEAKER_00]: full of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you realize that Mike pretty much
knows what he's talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just believe in him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it when people chat fact check me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, cause some of the wording
I'm like, wait, wait, wait, well it's
[SPEAKER_00]: designed like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times it's designed to be tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I call you I'm like, Hey, explain these
three words in a row.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that mean that I am or am I am not
to, I don't know if I like this or hate
[SPEAKER_01]: it, but voting is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've said it before and I've said it
again, if even half of the people that
[SPEAKER_01]: consume cannabis every year took a minute
to come out publicly and say we're pro
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and we vote, we would be the most
powerful voting block in the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States.
[SPEAKER_01]: We outnumber everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people like our friend who sent us the
message, they maybe they can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a huge, a huge majority of us all
have something to risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That voting booth is private and that
little ballot that comes in the mail is
[SPEAKER_00]: private.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dropped mine off in a little box and
there were like 10 cars in front of me and
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 cars behind me, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have no idea which one was mine
unless they could tell that I was the
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy handed motherfucker scribbling on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's no, they don't know who sent
that in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to have a weird like my life has
always been kind of segmented in like
[SPEAKER_01]: weird chunks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for a while, one of those chunks
involved fancy dinners with governors,
[SPEAKER_01]: Supreme Court justices in Colorado,
Senate members, House of Representatives,
[SPEAKER_01]: Senate members, the fucking governor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would be at a table with like the
district attorney and our two state
[SPEAKER_01]: senators from Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there'd be eight of us at the table
and we'd all be chit chatting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these were great opportunities for me
to just randomly mention pro cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was always delighted because
especially with our two senators,
[SPEAKER_01]: they always had cannabis questions for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They knew I would be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They knew I was going to be at their table
and they had two that they wanted answers
[SPEAKER_01]: to and they knew I was the person to come
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was after several of these
dinners.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you might not have that kind of peace
in your life, but everyone has a peace in
[SPEAKER_01]: their life where you can take good,
informed, supported cannabis knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And disseminated to people that need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find those opportunities and take
advantage of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people in the medical field that
have transformed how the department they
[SPEAKER_01]: work with or the doctor's office they work
in views cannabis, views cannabis to
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers, views medical marijuana,
all because they had a very uncomfortable
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation with their boss at one point
and slowly started bringing in information
[SPEAKER_01]: and watch their workplace convert from
anti cannabis to pro cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this certainly isn't possible for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, if you're making real money,
I wouldn't fuck with my paycheck just to
[SPEAKER_01]: be pro weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use a piece of that paycheck to fight for
the cause for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That leads to another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you can see the little
sloppily written dollar sign that I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: written down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: My methods of helping be an activist
behind the scenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But contribute financially to activism.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is not, this person actually
contributes to the podcast through
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also contribute to your local cannabis
legalization efforts or also the national
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's local, if it's statewide,
if it's national.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guarantee you've got a normal chapter in
your state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't going to say anybody specific,
but go with normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're always reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest, the best, the first,
the original.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the early seventies, you see Tommy
Chong and Cheech wearing normal shirts in
[SPEAKER_00]: their movies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So contribute some money to some activism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vote with your dollars is what our friend
Scotty Real taught us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get in there and send some money where
you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this person does, they contribute to
this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would assume they contribute to the Dude
Grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you they contribute to several
others because they're a great person.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is always a great way to
contribute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send money to normal, send money to your
local activism group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next thing that that leads me to is
if you're going to send money to somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's your local group, why not get
involved with your local group?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you can't attend the meetings and
show your face, it's the digital era.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a digital newsletter to that
fake email address you made so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can send those emails to your local reps
and to the newspaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get some newsletters, your local
newsletters sent to you and provide
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback, provide information.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're getting knowledge from Mike and
myself or other sources, include that in
[SPEAKER_00]: your feedback to that newsletter or create
the newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be your role and you can do that
anonymously.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that from your computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your underwear, while you're listening
to the show, you can jot down ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get it going and that can be your
service to the community behind the scenes
[SPEAKER_00]: with nobody ever seeing your face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, Pueblo for sensible cannabis
laws exists for two reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, we had an idiot pot group down here,
they sort of still exist, that was putting
[SPEAKER_01]: out a lot of bad information and that
information needed to be countered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other part of that, and this is
like 75% of it, is one of my nieces was
[SPEAKER_01]: ragging on my Facebook page because
everything was cannabis related at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't explicitly pro-cannabis,
it was a cannabis related news story or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just one dinner where she had
like three good burns that were all
[SPEAKER_01]: focused on my personal Facebook page being
overly cannabis related.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted another outlet for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's literally nothing stopping you
from starting a Facebook group in your
[SPEAKER_01]: area or a Facebook page or a Twitter page
under a separate account that's not
[SPEAKER_01]: overtly related to you where you can do
all sorts of digital activism that's not
[SPEAKER_01]: overtly under your name or is going to
come up in a simple background search.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always start a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can, you most certainly can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I encourage it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although to be honest, you get used to the
microphone and you admit things that you
[SPEAKER_01]: might not want to admit to the world
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so having someone like you that's
really good with GarageBand that can take
[SPEAKER_01]: out some of the insanity is kind of
necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking to get involved,
I'm thinking you're not currently
[SPEAKER_01]: involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so honestly like research and emailing
and letter writing, I think is a great
[SPEAKER_01]: place to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, campaign donations and
voting, they're super easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not time consuming and they're
incredibly effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud of myself for writing down
campaign donations and voting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty confident now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved the donate $4.20 to different
candidates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Campaign that was run during the last
election cycle because one thing that all
[SPEAKER_01]: politicians see is their donations and
they may not see every donation explicitly
[SPEAKER_01]: and like who it's from, but they're going
to thumb through the pages and see how
[SPEAKER_01]: they did that week at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they're flipping through the
binder, just standing through the pages
[SPEAKER_01]: and they've received a hundred donations
or 30 donations or whatever it is for the
[SPEAKER_01]: same amount, it's going to stand out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll say, why am I getting $4.20?
[SPEAKER_01]: The number explicitly tells you why you
got that donation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an incredibly effective messaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to watch in real time
politicians change their tone on the topic
[SPEAKER_01]: as this donation platform rolled out.
[SPEAKER_01]: People went from not discussing it to
having a campaign challenger or a primary
[SPEAKER_01]: challenger bring it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once or twice to having it be centerpiece
of their campaign to they've already
[SPEAKER_01]: pledged to get it done within the first
year or whatever their time in office.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they see all those $4.20 donations
coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They saw the support and they saw how far
the tides turned on this issue from just a
[SPEAKER_01]: few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's come quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happened really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a lot of unanswered questions
five years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we didn't know if like the UN was
going to lose their shit because we've
[SPEAKER_01]: signed international treaties that say we
won't legalize this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more than one.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all sorts of state and federal
rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's nothing stopping the DEA
from showing up and trying to shut us
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's absolutely nothing stopping them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every grow, every dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's stopping them is logistics in the
reality of it in public opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if public opinion were really against
us, they'd be trying to knock us down
[SPEAKER_01]: three a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'd be trying real hard and it'd be
all over the news.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they know that if they hit three on
Monday on Tuesday, they're going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: 200 and 300 people outside of everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: They try to hit on Tuesday and by
Wednesday we're going to be stopping
[SPEAKER_01]: highways and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you just gave me like, I was,
as you were building up to that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was building the most insane visual in
my head of like, well, fuck, they took
[SPEAKER_00]: down three dispensaries yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were this many cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's all go surround our favorite
dispensaries and fight back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it became this battle in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking so funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my mind, history loves to repeat
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we did this in California already a
couple of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's great footage in a couple
of the good cannabis documentaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like waiting to inhale and stuff where
the feds show up to rate a very popular
[SPEAKER_01]: farm with a huge number of patients that
was growing in the best way they could and
[SPEAKER_01]: giving away as much as they could.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the feds are rating these people and
the feds have to do negotiations that
[SPEAKER_01]: involve letting the people they arrested
that morning call the crowd that is formed
[SPEAKER_01]: while they were cutting all the plants
down to beg the crowd to disperse,
[SPEAKER_01]: to please not do anything, to please let
these officers pass peaceably.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they roll up their windows,
they tuck down, they fucking ran and they
[SPEAKER_01]: did not come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would happen if we threatened,
no, we're just going to burn down all the
[SPEAKER_00]: bars and breweries, no more alcohol for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wouldn't even have to do, we wouldn't
even have to damage stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one of the things that nobody
understands about politics and numbers is
[SPEAKER_01]: once you reach a certain size of the
crowd, you can achieve anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at history, wonderful
things have been achieved, horrible
[SPEAKER_01]: atrocities have been achieved and they've
both been achieved the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a whole crowd hyped up about one
thing or the other and you just run with
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I honestly think that if the DEA
showed up and just for an example,
[SPEAKER_01]: they start at one end of the state,
they try to work their way to the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can only bust, there's only so many
DEA agents, even if they had every DEA
[SPEAKER_01]: agent on the planet show up in Southern
Colorado, they couldn't do Trinidad in a
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so literally by the end of day one,
there's enough news footage, there's
[SPEAKER_01]: enough press footage of this happening and
this being the plan to disseminate across
[SPEAKER_01]: the globe.
[SPEAKER_01]: News goes out instantly now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's enough of us just in Colorado
that if we all hopped in our cars and took
[SPEAKER_01]: the three hour drive, we could end it all
in a minute just by showing up and being
[SPEAKER_01]: like, Hey, no, go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want you here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all we'd have to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wouldn't have to shout.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wouldn't have to yell.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just have to show up at once and say it
in unison.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we used to do it once a year on 4 20
down at civic center before medical,
[SPEAKER_01]: before legalization in 98, 2004,
a hundred thousand people would just walk
[SPEAKER_01]: into civic center park and the cops,
if this was any other day would ruin a
[SPEAKER_01]: month or more of your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you lit up cannabis and a hundred
thousand of us just did it together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was nothing they could do about
it because they knew that if they started
[SPEAKER_01]: grabbing one of us, they'd have to deal
with a hundred thousand of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we weren't hurting nobody.
[SPEAKER_01]: We weren't arguing with nobody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just peacefully came together,
had a good laugh, peacefully laughed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was nothing they could do about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just that happening so many years in a
row, push the conversation in Colorado so
[SPEAKER_01]: much faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we saw the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seattle had a big smokeout, California had
a number of big smokeouts.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something that, I mean,
the five or the six years down the road
[SPEAKER_01]: after the first smokeout, when the news
anchors still making the same jokes,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're like, wait a second on St.
Patty's day, St. Patty's was Monday.
[SPEAKER_01]: By Wednesday, the DUI reports are out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking 420 was months ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never read a report saying a bunch of
traffic accidents ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That stuff starts to sink in little side
effects of just the visual start to sink
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one year where the worst thing
that could have happened happened happened
[SPEAKER_01]: in Denver and somebody brought a gun and
fired off three rounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Minor injuries, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think anybody was severely
injured.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of people got hurt when people
were running away.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I remember the next day when everyone
was like, wait, a hundred thousand people
[SPEAKER_01]: got really high and then ran away really
fast, got in their cars and sped out of
[SPEAKER_01]: here in no fender benders, no flipped over
cars, no run over pedestrians,
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a hundred thousand people just
evacuated the area immediately without any
[SPEAKER_01]: major traffic issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watching the news media try to wrestle
with that blatantly obvious fact that they
[SPEAKER_01]: were trying not to specifically address
was funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a tragic incident and I hated to
see it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, it was one of those
real world tests that teaches us a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff we didn't know we needed to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Colorado, we learned a lot of those
lessons over the last five years and the
[SPEAKER_01]: rest of the world stood up and took note.
[SPEAKER_01]: When these conversations go down this year
in Virginia and New Jersey, the debate
[SPEAKER_01]: about whether the UN's going to send
peacekeepers to shut down the weed store,
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to have that fucking debate more
than once.
[SPEAKER_01]: Convincing people that the UN wasn't going
to impose major sanctions against
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado, it was nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: All those conversations are gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can look at year after year after year
of teen use data now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all online.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just need to know how to ask Google.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just ask Nice and it'll tell you teen
use has not gone up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing that has changed in a big
way is the perception of harm.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the bullshit we were spoon feeding
them in the 90s is no longer being spoon
[SPEAKER_01]: fed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actual information is being spoon fed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their opinions on cannabis are more in
line with reality and that's statistically
[SPEAKER_01]: visible in the graphs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that their attitudes towards
how dangerous it is has drastically
[SPEAKER_01]: changed over the last five or 10 years,
but their use rates haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are starting to see videos like the
Brave Michaela videos and the video of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ...
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the person's name and I would
rather know his name because I feel
[SPEAKER_00]: disrespectful, but there's a man on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see the video all the time in marijuana
groups, cannabis groups, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start having a seizure and they
squirt a little CBD oil on his mouth and
[SPEAKER_00]: within seconds, the dude stops having a
major seizure.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are seeing videos like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's making ... If you show
videos like that to my mom, she cries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, she didn't believe it
when I called cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like, you guys are just using that
as an excuse to smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when she sees things like that,
she gets a little tear in her eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like, oh, you guys are right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember saying one night, it wasn't
Thanksgiving dinner, but it was a similar
[SPEAKER_01]: family event with 15 or 20 people there,
most of whom were older adults that I
[SPEAKER_01]: respected in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember telling one of them that
cannabis was the most beneficial plant
[SPEAKER_01]: known to man.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a statement largely based on the
different products we can make with hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of the minor medical uses we've
known about for a long time with THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: like lowering inner eye pressure,
helping with nausea, especially for
[SPEAKER_01]: chemotherapy patients and the like,
who really have trouble swallowing fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: other medications, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've known that hard science since the
late 70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember most of the people at the table
laughing at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when you say things like that,
it's just part of the press about the
[SPEAKER_01]: foreign bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: People start telling you about their CBD
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you really think about it, cotton,
oil, and trees, think about all the stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: and all of the damage we're doing to the
environment, the planet, ourselves,
[SPEAKER_01]: each other, over some of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine if we could change all of that
with fields that are currently growing
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill them up with hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can stop clear cutting forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, we've got to start wrapping up this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost two o'clock, so we've got to
start wrapping this up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is super late.
[SPEAKER_00]: That won't be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just edit that part out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just imagine what we're going to see over
the next five or six years when this
[SPEAKER_01]: really happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to see this market take off
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to recap on what this person asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: What got us into this is they asked for
ways that they can be active without
[SPEAKER_00]: exposing themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got way off the track.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to start wrapping up this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Create an anonymous email account.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't even need to be anonymous if
you don't want it to.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want your statement to have impact,
at least attach a fake name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: A fake name.
[SPEAKER_00]: A pen name.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a pen name on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write some emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send those to your local politicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: The mayor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who helps us make those rules?
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on who you want to reach.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking at local level,
it's probably a mayor or a president of
[SPEAKER_01]: city council or the current president of
your county commission.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all stuff you'll be able to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just Google the name of the place you're
talking about and then add the word
[SPEAKER_01]: government to the end of it and it will
bring up the cast of characters.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's the state, you're looking at the
governor, nation president, senator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Email all of them and do it once a week
and tell them that you support the
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them make them crazy easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bigger the politician, the easier they
make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to email Trump, Google the
words email and Trump together and it will
[SPEAKER_01]: basically bring you up a link where you
can email a dummy box that some intern at
[SPEAKER_01]: the president's office answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have more luck if you just hit
them up on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But senators, like your state senator,
it's just as easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Google email Elizabeth Warren.
[SPEAKER_01]: Email Lee Roy Garcia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Email Bob Bennett.
[SPEAKER_01]: And boom, it brings up their direct email
address that goes to a staffer in their
[SPEAKER_01]: office usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're assigned to send you the
blanket reply for that topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your interest in this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be back with a reply.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the important things that those
people do is they rank them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so at a certain point, this politician
gets a little report that says,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, you had 47 people this week reach out
about gun control or health care or
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 were pro, 40 were against.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they get those numbers and they get a
gauge of what their constituents are
[SPEAKER_01]: willing to reach out about them about.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you live in the area that votes for
this person, mention that explicitly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to be like, I live at one,
two, three, four, but hey, I live in your
[SPEAKER_01]: district and I vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's my issue that I care about.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a more effective message than just,
hey, vote for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I send those to people who I don't
vote for all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of other people do too.
[SPEAKER_01]: The anti-cannabis groups are getting
better at the emailing thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I watch them try to teach people how to do
this and it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our community is much better with
technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we're gonna have those
issues, but this is super easy to do to
[SPEAKER_01]: reach out to your representatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, then once you've reached out to
all of them, use that same email address
[SPEAKER_00]: to send some letters to the editor of your
local newspapers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just the local, go to the other cities
surrounding you also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before you submit, read it aloud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, make sure it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, please, please, please edit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you can create a Facebook group or
you can go join other forums or you can
[SPEAKER_00]: create a podcast if you're that kind of
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: People may learn your voice eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to be low key about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also contribute financially to
activism causes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can send $4.20.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can send $7.10 to your favorite
podcast on Patreon every month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying just me, I'm saying myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dude grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of good podcasts out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could use some support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who else do we support?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tad Hussey at Kiss Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can help out so many people
financially.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got local cannabis or local
cannabis activism that you can support
[SPEAKER_00]: financially.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of other national groups
than normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't want to stress one above the
other, but like there's students for a
[SPEAKER_01]: sensible drug policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the national, there's normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the marijuana policy project.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, those are just the ones that I'm
randomly thinking of here at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch and there's going to be
state specific groups, no matter which
[SPEAKER_01]: state you live in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So join those, maybe create a newsletter
or just be a part of the newsletter and
[SPEAKER_00]: add, contribute to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reply, say, hey, I think this,
get some conversations going with people,
[SPEAKER_00]: open their minds, share the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're listening, you're learning a lot
of good stuff that you can share.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go share a lot of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the final one that I've got on the
list, Mike, the most obvious that Mike
[SPEAKER_00]: likes to talk about that I'm proud of
myself for having written down without
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of guidance is vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes time to vote on cannabis,
just show up and vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, they send a little
paper to your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to miss it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make it a lot harder in other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really, oh, do they?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause here it's like a different color
than all the other mail and it's got the
[SPEAKER_00]: big flag on it and it says ballot.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've made it remarkably easy in
Colorado, but there are still many places
[SPEAKER_01]: around the country that make it pretty
hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some places you have to go to a
physical location, other places you have
[SPEAKER_01]: to register months in advance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can be a little tricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you do it once, you know how it
goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's super easy to do again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also insanely important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a magic trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were a cannabis consumer and you
are listening, you're going to vote,
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage your pothead friends to vote
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're tricking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not realistically going and
advocating cannabis, but you're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: getting a vote for our side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're just telling your pothead
friends to vote a piece for the people to
[SPEAKER_01]: still listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause obviously you care about this topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will turn this off by now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those personal conversations I was talking
about aren't just with anti cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: people, also pro cannabis people.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of misinformation and bad
information in the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we disseminate that publicly,
it hurts our cause.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so having the courage to sit down with
your pro cannabis friends and be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro, when you're out there talking about
pro cannabis stuff, could you pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: please not talk about chemtrails?
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you maybe not open your speech with
your beliefs about its cancer curative
[SPEAKER_01]: properties and maybe talk about some of
the other benefits of legalization that
[SPEAKER_01]: you also believe in that we can support
with hard data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's making those arguments in a
way that can be quickly fact checked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the most effective in reducing our
bad information that our community is
[SPEAKER_01]: putting out is just as helpful is
converting other people to our cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't bro science people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what Mike is saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Mike, we've been going for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the longest podcasts we've
done in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a very little touch of
editing in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a lot of stuff to say today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could just let you keep
recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you're fired up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep going to, but we need to stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really late folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's late.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to wrap up this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys for listening.

I'm okay with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of thinking that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may be two shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to add some of this
stuff out, but it should be out right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who knows?
