[SPEAKER_04]: Yo, what's up, Podcast World?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time for episode number 206 of the
Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing another Throwback Thursday
episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: This time, I'm doing episodes 36,
37, and 38 of what used to be known as the
[SPEAKER_04]: I Grow Culture Podcast, currently known as
the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before I get to that episode, I need to
make a couple of updates and disclaimers.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of the social media has changed.
[SPEAKER_04]: The new social media is at GFYH Podcast on
Twitter, it's the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_04]: Podcast on Facebook, and if you'd like to
send me an email, it's
[SPEAKER_04]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, some of my ideas and opinions may
have changed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of my methods and techniques may have
changed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done over 200 episodes of this
podcast, and I've learned a lot along the
[SPEAKER_04]: way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you have, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I say something in these old episodes
that I contradict in a new episode,
[SPEAKER_04]: go with the new method because this is an
ever-evolving industry, and I learn
[SPEAKER_04]: something every day, and I hope you do,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I said something weird, don't hold it
against me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ladies and gentlemen, with no further ado,
here is episode 36, 37, and 38 of the I
[SPEAKER_04]: Grow Culture Podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys for listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time for episode number 36 of the I
Grow Culture Podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: They call me Rasta Jeff, and I'm your
host.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a stressful but fantastic week.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a very stressful week.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, speaking of stressful, I owe you a
huge thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, we've talked about these city
council meetings for the past few
[SPEAKER_04]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, Mike, I thought he was going to
stand.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got a nice little seat for you
there, like a real cushy chair and a
[SPEAKER_04]: microphone and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You look like a boss.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Mike presented a nice statement to
city council, and he actually had some
[SPEAKER_04]: success in what he was trying to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll talk about that a little bit
because I really want to spend some time
[SPEAKER_04]: on the city council meeting topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of stuff to talk about
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's been a crazy week in marijuana
ordinance news, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll get to that in a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We for sure will.
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about this a little bit on the
last episode, but Clint wasn't here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Clint and I got to go see Joey Coco Diaz.
[SPEAKER_06]: Joey Diaz.
[SPEAKER_06]: Joey Diaz.
[SPEAKER_04]: I skipped a part I really want to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, today we are celebrating Clint's
eighth year anniversary of sobriety from
[SPEAKER_04]: alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Way to go, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Congrats.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_04]: You said it's nothing to toot about,
but that is eight years is that strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easy now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, congrats, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for sticking with it, because I
don't think we'd hang out if you were the
[SPEAKER_04]: drunk you were before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I was a piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm still a piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't showcase it as much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alcohol really displays your shitty side,
doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I don't drink, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I don't drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've seen the South Park on my trash
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep pretty much anything under
wraps until you get a couple of beers in
[SPEAKER_00]: you and then all of the demons come just
pouring out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a depressant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a depressant.
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't help me much.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I quit drinking when I got my
medical marijuana card and my life is
[SPEAKER_04]: easier, happier.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I wake up, I know where my money is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know where my car is parked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still drink occasionally, like I'll have
Dos Equis, but for the most part,
[SPEAKER_00]: I quit like five or six years back just
because I got really good at throwing up
[SPEAKER_00]: in bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I distinctly remember walking up a
flight of stairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the Celtic in downtown Denver
thinking like, yeah, man, like you didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: get any on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a pro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got about halfway up the stairs and
it dawned on me that that's not something
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to be pro at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, yeah, this is just one of those
like, now I feel weird because I'm like 25
[SPEAKER_00]: and all my social life revolves around the
bars and the bar scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a little weird to step out of
that for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now it's just where I live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alcohol doesn't play a big role.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once I moved away from my party town,
it was a lot easier for me to quit
[SPEAKER_04]: drinking.
[SPEAKER_04]: I lived in Lawrence, Kansas for a little
while and it's just really easy to be a
[SPEAKER_04]: Spunny in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I came here where there's a lot
of drinking and I know everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that sucked me in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But once I realized what I was doing,
I just gave it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can smoke all the weed I can handle.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took a gram dab last night.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, why would I even need alcohol in my
life at all?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going to do another one tonight.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to do it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: I filmed myself taking a gram dab last
night and the video was very
[SPEAKER_04]: disappointing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put the dab on the dabber kind of wonky
and it just, it wasn't real.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was not an impressive video.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to try it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be a fun video if we could have like
the count from Sesame Street, like
[SPEAKER_00]: photoshopped in there on one dab,
two dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it took me several inhales and
exhales to get that dab just partially
[SPEAKER_04]: because the way I dropped it on the nail,
I didn't time it right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was my breath and starting it was...
[SPEAKER_04]: Practice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big dab on a teeny rig, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of big dabs on teeny rigs,
this podcast is brought to you by our good
[SPEAKER_04]: friends at Cannabis Grand Crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's Grand Crew, you ask?
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to check out the website,
cannabisgrandcrew.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's spelled Grand C-R-U, like the motley
crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a private cannabis event in Aspen,
Colorado, hosted by the Grimy Gatsby and
[SPEAKER_04]: several of the industry leaders.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have a lot more information,
but please check that out and support the
[SPEAKER_04]: Grimy Gatsby, cannabisgrandcrew.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were going to talk about Joey Diaz
before I got on this really huge
[SPEAKER_02]: sidetrack, but anywhere we were,
I knew where we were.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what we're doing, dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like Joey knows what he's doing,
brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen a lot of comedians and Anthony
Jeselnik was one of my favorites,
[SPEAKER_04]: but every second of his act, from the time
he walks out to the time he says thank
[SPEAKER_04]: you, every second of that is calculated.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see him counting between jokes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see his mouth going one,
two, three, and he counts to 11.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he tells another joke.
Really?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's that style.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: He comes out and that's like, if that was
a band, who would I compare that to?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like Rush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every note is they know what they're doing
tonight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every single note all the way through.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeselnik did that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Joey Diaz came out and kind of had an idea
of what he was going to say and just
[SPEAKER_04]: leveled us just being himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of that, maybe he's told those bits
two or three times.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the bits he told, I swear I heard
him make up on accident on the podcast
[SPEAKER_04]: just a few days before he flew to
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a fucking pro.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he took that like something like just
right now we'd be saying something and
[SPEAKER_04]: he'd be like, oh my God, dog, that's
tremendous dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm writing that shit down, dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he makes 15 minutes out of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brought it to us in Denver several days
later and ruined the club with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: My stomach and ribs and this part of my
jaw right here was sore.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was laughing so hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to tense up my back because it was
hurting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to move my muscle tension somewhere
else.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were sitting back like a little,
I realized because I was sitting forward
[SPEAKER_02]: on the edge of my seat the whole time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just sitting forward and just
excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just every word he was going to say
was going to make me laugh.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jeff said it, he goes, Clint,
you were laughing harder than anybody else
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was good because you appreciated the
show.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we talked about being a good audience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Clint is a performer and we know what it's
like.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm a musician.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know what it's like to have a stale
audience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it wasn't us kissing his ass either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joey was on fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah, he was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that was the thing is, so he does
about maybe an hour, hour and 15,
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he crushes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no point in there when I was
bored or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then afterwards we're like,
oh, can we meet him?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're wanting to like get
backstage.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we just want to say thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took a bunch of weed for Joey Diaz also.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ain't no chump.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to try to give him a little
bit of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then all of a sudden he talks to
every single person that wants to talk to
[SPEAKER_04]: him.
[SPEAKER_04]: He came out to the hallway of the club and
just hung out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only exit that you could take.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's just standing there and you could
shake his hand and get a picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: He took a picture with everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody, everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: He asks you your name and then addresses
you by name in the conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He remembers your name for that talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's that kind of guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you listen to Diaz, you know,
he probably still remembers our names.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we see him again, he'd be like,
oh, fucking Clint, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Clint, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Dog?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because he calls you dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every other word is dog and cocksucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you stand up and out of the crowd just
a teeny bit on your own?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it helps that he's cool, but like you
guys have an extra little leg up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're both memorable on site.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to get some ski caps, bro,
and be Opie and Conjax for Halloween.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could do that, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking like Ope.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little more every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a man beard over there,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just got to get my wife killed somehow and
then hook up with a prostitute.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm set.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of awkward silence for a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you guys not get the suns and clouds?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sent out a tweet this week about your
beard that just crushed me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the, like, with a beard like this,
you can't pee indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent about five minutes laughing at
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sort of true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you guys, if you find beard trees
growing along the Pacific Northwest,
[SPEAKER_04]: Clint was plucking beard hairs out of his
beard and throwing them out the window in
[SPEAKER_04]: hopes to plant little beard trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just trying to get back to the
community, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let us know how that worked if you're in
the PNW.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we hung out with Joey for probably an
hour afterwards.
[SPEAKER_04]: So everybody hangs out, takes a picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Joey Diaz taps me on the shoulder and
walks away and says, Ross, the Jeff,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know I love you, right, cocksucker?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: He just called me cocksucker.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Clint was smooth about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He stuck out his hand and wanted that one
final, like, this is my one-on-one.
[SPEAKER_04]: He goes, hey, I'm an open mic comedian and
what you did, I think you told him
[SPEAKER_04]: something about what you did just changed
my mic or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it just, it was real inspiring is
what I think I told him.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he goes, dog, you're an open mic or
dog?
[SPEAKER_04]: Come here, dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, just took like seven steps away
from where we were into this little like
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of ambient area and had a talk with
Clint about open mic and stand-up comedy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you want to tell the world what he
told you or, you know, keep that to
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was so cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so cool just to have this like
one-on-one with a legend.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my mind, he's a legend.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, you know, I don't get starstruck or
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he's a cool fucking guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he just, he was so personable,
but he was just like, dog, you got to
[SPEAKER_01]: write an hour a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all you got to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe for two weeks, you're not going to
get nothing, but you just got to write and
[SPEAKER_01]: you got to write and you got to keep after
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to get on stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, you know, and I was just sitting
there just listening, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's cause I'm not trying to tell
him anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just Joey, this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, and I wasn't,
he was trying to get out of there too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, Hey, I appreciate it,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to let you get out of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you have a great time in Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was great.
[SPEAKER_04]: He didn't want to leave.
[SPEAKER_04]: He liked hanging out and just having a
conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: He was like, I got to go dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to, but you can see,
you can see he was a little tired,
[SPEAKER_02]: but he was just like, God damn,
I don't want to leave.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a great guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if this gets back to Joey Diaz,
thank you for the great show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for hanging out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: We love you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and you got, you gained a fan for
life by just hanging out for that hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Times two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also thanks for just taking a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you're a busy dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know you had to get to the hotel and
smoke that blunt they gave you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those edibles that you got.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks for just hanging out.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: You took a minute and that means a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're he's been in the longest yard.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's on Joe Rogan's podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got his own podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can take an ear bashing,
if you've got some balls, listen to the
[SPEAKER_04]: church of what's happening now with Joey
Coco Diaz and Lee Syatt.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not for Gentiles.
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll tell you to go fuck yourself on the
first episode you listen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So be prepared.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you can get past that, it's a great
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he's funny as shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and, and if you get a chance to
see him live, there's, there's,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you miss out, you will be, you will
regret it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have an adult diaper, wear one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to piss my pants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was laughing so hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing was is I had to piss the whole
time he was up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, I am not leaving for one
moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would piss myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I, I was so happy to be there and the
tickets were reasonable.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw him at the Denver improv.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful club.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful club.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love to go back there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will be back there also.
[SPEAKER_04]: We made a new friend that night.
[SPEAKER_04]: His name's Abdullah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Abdullah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just traveled to Mississippi and I
hope you're doing well there, my friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope everything worked out for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Find us, find us on the internet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Find me on some social media.
[SPEAKER_04]: You said, you don't do that, but he
actually downloaded the podcast while he
[SPEAKER_04]: was sitting next to us.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a good chance he's listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Find me, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Abdullah.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hope everything worked out.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

[SPEAKER_04]: There was a city council meeting on
Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was some hilarious shit to talk
about from that meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot to talk about from that
meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: What part caught you as hilarious?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go to every city council meeting for
the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody there knows me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm used to the police chief and the fire
chief and the city manager and the city
[SPEAKER_00]: attorney and the council members coming up
and saying hi or waving or giving me two
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes to talk to them about whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody in our community is,
and I was sort of early to the meeting,
[SPEAKER_00]: I had signed up to speak, and from the
seat I usually sit in, I can't see the
[SPEAKER_00]: doors that people walk in from,
but I can see the city staff and the city
[SPEAKER_00]: council real well, and they're kind of
milling around waiting for the meeting to
[SPEAKER_00]: start, and their decorum all just,
they freeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when somebody, I don't know,
runs through a room naked and the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: the well-dressed people go, wait,
did that just happen and everybody freezes
[SPEAKER_00]: for a second?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I swivel my head and I see two and a
quarter sets of dreadlocks walk in the
[SPEAKER_00]: door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff and two supporters, he brought to the
meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they want to be named.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, they're supporters.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for coming guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Adam and Angela, thank you guys a lot for
joining me to the city council meeting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your numbers made a difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk about that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, as you guys walked in,
everybody was sort of like, whoa,
[SPEAKER_00]: hippies, it's city council.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two people were Jedi staring me,
dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could feel one guy's eyes cooking a hole
through my shirt and reading my soul.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, hi.
[SPEAKER_04]: I looked at him and nodded like,
uh-huh, I'm not sure why you're staring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, this is weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I translucent right now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Has he seen a ghost?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so people start speaking and I go,
I look at them while they speak,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I get the creepy feeling again
and I look to my left and that dude is
[SPEAKER_04]: like this at me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for the listeners, it's an intense
stare, but like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just intense and sort of angry,
flat faced.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had never met the man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never met the man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've known him enough to like say hi and
shake his hand, but the city manager could
[SPEAKER_00]: not stop staring at you.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's another guy who fits the exact
description of rich white guys,
[SPEAKER_04]: like rich white councilmen.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's who you'd think of.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I saw him, I'd go, yeah, city council
guy, run some shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the city attorney.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The city manager looked at him and goes,
who's the guy in the hat?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I saw him say it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like he didn't care that I was watching
him.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of awkward.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Through the whole meeting, he kept staring
at my little group of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in a city council meeting, they do,
they have a little structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have their agenda meeting right at
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they have like a little,
they say the pledge of allegiance and they
[SPEAKER_04]: pray.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they open up the floor and they
say, they do public comment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then right after that, they say,
thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or they do city contributions or
something.
[SPEAKER_04]: They called it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call it public forum where anyone
from the public can speak for five
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they have council commentary
right after that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where any of the council members- There
was a part right before that where the
[SPEAKER_04]: lady goes, this is the part where we would
normally say thanks to the people that
[SPEAKER_04]: have contributed to the community.
[SPEAKER_04]: Last week we did 101.
[SPEAKER_04]: Luckily there are none this week.
[SPEAKER_04]: My little group chuckled and I go,
huh, no shout outs on the episode this
[SPEAKER_04]: week was what I said, because I thought
that was funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like Mike said, after that,
they let each council member speak.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the first council member speaks and
he's like, so first off, I want to say
[SPEAKER_04]: thanks to this person and this person.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I chuckled a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, huh.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the next one is like, I want to say
thanks to this person.
[SPEAKER_04]: So five people in a row go and they all
basically did shout outs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And by the fourth one, I giggled.
[SPEAKER_04]: I giggled out loud.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the girl next to me, Angela giggled.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Adam leaned over and giggled.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were all just like church giggling
and Angela had the balls to say it.
[SPEAKER_04]: She goes, shout outs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we just couldn't even handle ourselves
anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even Montoya wasn't at this meeting,
but her little council commentary for most
[SPEAKER_00]: of the meetings is it's blander than any
advertising you've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's almost a bulletin board
reading session for a bunch of random
[SPEAKER_00]: local events.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, her shout outs are always come to
the Pinewood Derby or come down to the
[SPEAKER_00]: softball game next week, or we're doing an
Eastside Park cleanup, like super duper
[SPEAKER_00]: simple shout outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of fun to watch every week.
[SPEAKER_04]: The city council does some shout outs,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like 20 minutes of solid,
like, and big shout outs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one, one person goes, and also thanks
to make it Parks and Rec and kept going.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, ah, they just shout out
Parks and Rec.
[SPEAKER_04]: They did it like a real shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really fucking funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thought that was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hilarious.
Hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're there watching, it's,
it's a play like anything you would buy
[SPEAKER_00]: tickets to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just about stuff that's usually
really boring.
[SPEAKER_04]: This may get me in trouble, but it's
really funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know if I should say this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to address the president of city
council as madam president.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not required.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city staff do it out of respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you call your father.
[SPEAKER_04]: In a very condescending tone.
[SPEAKER_04]: In a very condescending tone.
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple of them were like, yes,
fucking madam fucking president was like
[SPEAKER_04]: what they should have said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe a dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe $5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't going to stop you earlier because
you were on a roll.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody count them up guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody count them up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to pay that guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I promise $5 per episode on this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I promised it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: May have to, may have to come after
nature's green remedies gets a refill,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it'll happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's been quite a bit of
controversy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I don't know, friction,
I suppose you'd call it between the city
[SPEAKER_00]: council and city staff and members of city
council.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of months ago, the council
commentary thing was like the polite is
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you have ever heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the city councilmen was in the
paper saying stuff two or three of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other ones was doing was illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he kept using the phrase shadow
government and like they were ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I seriously was waiting for him to
rise up with ice picks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like as soon as they come
[SPEAKER_04]: in, I'm going to have to fire them up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, you know, I was sitting in the
seat where I could hear the whole
[SPEAKER_04]: production crew too.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was really a privilege.
[SPEAKER_04]: Being a nerd, like loving tech gear.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was loving it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could see all the sound equipment and I
could hear the camera crew behind me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: There in that there's one door between me
and them and you could hear them five,
[SPEAKER_04]: four, three.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're live.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just neat watching it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I picked those seats for a reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: I posted a picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: I posted a picture on Instagram of myself
that was on the I was on the news and
[SPEAKER_04]: someone's like, dude, you look paranoid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, that facial expression was when
the city council president announced her
[SPEAKER_04]: resignation.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the face I made.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the moment that that picture was
taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't believe they used you and Angela
as the reaction footage for that shot
[SPEAKER_00]: though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the whole room went, and they were
like, oh, get the dreadlocks, get them on
[SPEAKER_00]: camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy working the camera was one of my
best friends from high school.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we played in a band together in
1998.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, he knew me.
[SPEAKER_04]: He walked up and said, hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really fun being in the council
meeting and a newscaster in a suit walks
[SPEAKER_04]: up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hi, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's the same newscaster that
tried to get an interview with me after.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_04]: He talked to you for a minute during in
there, but you were kind of, you got
[SPEAKER_04]: shooken up, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get a little nervous right before you
speak.
[SPEAKER_04]: You go in tunnel vision mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate public speaking so much,
but it's sorted by default.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the guy that has to stand up and
speak because I've got the squeaky clean
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got the college education.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got the good vocabulary.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got the dreadlocks in the beard.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't want to talk to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: They stared me down just sitting in
council.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I would have walked up there,
you got five minutes and they would have
[SPEAKER_04]: pulled out their phones and just started
tweeting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I had to went up there,
they'd be like, we're not going to let the
[SPEAKER_04]: guy with the felony come on here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And let the security stand up a little
closer, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So city council meeting, Mike went and
spoke against the proposed ordinance that
[SPEAKER_04]: was coming up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to tell us how that went so that
I don't have to fumble through it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The proposed ordinance is still sitting at
the planning and zoning level.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are what's called a recommending
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: They suggest things to the city council
and the city council can run with that
[SPEAKER_00]: idea or have them amend that idea in some
way, or they can kill it all together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually city council tells planning and
zoning, like, Hey, we'd like to see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they go work on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my understanding that this is not
that kind of ordinance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something planning and zoning has
been working on as their own effort to
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of show city council as a way to
solve some of the complaints they've been
[SPEAKER_00]: receiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, planning and zoning is fired
up because people can see and smell pot
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's bad as far as they're
concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would like to come up with rules
and regulations so that no one ever sees
[SPEAKER_00]: or smells pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're trying to grow your own
marijuana or know someone that is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see how problematic that might
become.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got to get it all the way back
out of sight and out of mind, and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't do that in your own home.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problems with this ordinance sort of
spin out of control real rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, as far as the community goes,
I think don't like it on every,
[SPEAKER_00]: every part of it is bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we tried to rally up people with
the last episode and a couple of other
[SPEAKER_00]: things to get down to the meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this time we had a pretty good show of
support at the city council meeting on
[SPEAKER_00]: Tuesday night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spoke during public forum and sort of
pleaded with them to think about how many
[SPEAKER_00]: people in the city they're affecting with
these rules, how many people's rights
[SPEAKER_00]: under amendment 20 or amendment 64 would
be restricted by these rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, now all of a sudden you've got
roommates trying to figure out who gets to
[SPEAKER_00]: exercise their constitutional rights and
who doesn't because you can only exercise
[SPEAKER_00]: so many of them at one time in a home with
the plan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Mike showed up with statistics and
counts.
[SPEAKER_04]: He told the city council, how many
patients there are in the city and county.
[SPEAKER_04]: He told them how many of them have a
caregiver.
[SPEAKER_04]: He told them how much it costs to make a
facility like they're required.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the people that spoke at city
council, the city council kind of gave
[SPEAKER_04]: them the look of, yeah, we've heard this
before and you're back again this week.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_04]: When Mike spoke, they all kind of sat up
and they actually leaned forward and
[SPEAKER_04]: listened.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was paying more attention to their faces
and just listened into Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like it when I speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: A number of council members have told me,
like, thanks for having like some data to
[SPEAKER_00]: back up what you're saying or taking the
time to read the entire article.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get a lot of rambling at them and
like angry rambling and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're fired up and you're passionate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a big fan of public speaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me incredibly nervous,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did our best to calm me down.
[SPEAKER_04]: You said, I'm nervous as shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we just started talking to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all sweaty and pasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: But somebody's got to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been the one that's been biting
that bullet lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went down Tuesday night and said my
piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, like usually when people
bring supporters down for their issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: like lately when the trash haulers speak,
there's like five or 10 trash haulers
[SPEAKER_00]: behind them that really take a minute to
cheer and clap as soon as the whoever's
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten up to speak is done speaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I half expected what were there six or
seven people behind us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say there's about eight of us,
eight plus us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't sure how well I did when I get up
and I start giving a speech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I go into a weird little zone
where I know what kind of what I'm saying
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm prepared to say, you know,
something specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once I get up and start talking,
there isn't a filter between like brain
[SPEAKER_00]: mic and mouth mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nobody being like, don't cuss or
make sure you emphasize this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all adrenaline.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you realize what you said at the end?
[SPEAKER_04]: You stood up and you said, thank you for
my time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he walked away from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's the perfect example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my heart's pounding so fast and
there's so much adrenaline.
[SPEAKER_00]: They knew what you meant.
[SPEAKER_04]: They knew what you meant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what you meant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You meant, hey, you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, essentially like that's what's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you don't have time to Google this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So by coming out and showing support and
by you speaking, and there was another guy
[SPEAKER_04]: that went to another meeting who spoke
about his family and how this was
[SPEAKER_04]: affecting them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Such a traumatic way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you, did you guys make a difference?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did we all make a difference?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's we've said it's been curbed for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Monday we had a city meeting or
starting Monday or since Monday,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've had a city council meeting,
a planning and zoning meeting,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a county commissioner's meeting at
each one of those three meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were discussing rules that would take
away your ability to grow in your own
[SPEAKER_00]: home, limit the amount of plants you're
you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to an arbitrary number that they
just picked.
[SPEAKER_00]: They decided, ah, that ought to be enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll cap it at 12 in the city or 16 or 18
in the county.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you live up in Bula and have 400
acres and all of that's one property,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can only grow 18 plants there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter how many different
residents are set up on your property and
[SPEAKER_00]: none of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's just really terrible
rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the community kind of tried to rally.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did the podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was another community meeting at the
daily grind.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another one tomorrow at four o
'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anyone wants to come on Friday to four
o'clock.
[SPEAKER_04]: This will go up till Monday morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: So nevermind.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are late.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, you guys didn't show up where you
guys were waiting on you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want you to go back in time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all dabbed and started thinking this
was live.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can put this out tomorrow if we wanted.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just have to record another one for
Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the progress we made to get everybody
that could make it made it everybody that
[SPEAKER_00]: felt like they wanted to speak spoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met the gentleman who was quoted in the
chieftain who is a young guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a little younger than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say he's maybe 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a wife who's sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a mother-in-law who's sick and
he's got a child with cancer and he's
[SPEAKER_00]: their caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a job where he can't consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's just taking care of them and his
testimony.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was like I was throwing
spitballs and he rolled up in a tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they heard what I had to say at all
three meetings and they appreciated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They appreciated me coming down and saying
my piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when he got up and spoke, they hit the
brakes hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see you opened up for this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was the headliner.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the headliner.
Essentially.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's come of your guys' work?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they stop it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they hesitate?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they going to rework it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The county is, they delayed the vote again
to do more research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch the county commissioner's website.
[SPEAKER_00]: They post their agendas on Fridays
usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their meetings are usually Tuesdays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get about five days to check it out
and a heads up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city has the planning and zoning
commission delayed presenting this plan to
[SPEAKER_00]: city council by two months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have given those that came to
speak at the planning and zoning meeting a
[SPEAKER_00]: seat at the table while these rules get
reworked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple of us that came to speak
against and a couple of people that came
[SPEAKER_00]: to speak for, we'll be sitting at the
table while these get redone.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something I kind of wanted to ask
you about.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you address city council,
you actually said, guys, please find
[SPEAKER_04]: somebody that knows what they're talking
about when you do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You looked them straight in the face.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, you guys don't know anything
about weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please find somebody that knows what
they're talking about and put them on your
[SPEAKER_04]: committee.
[SPEAKER_04]: I almost considered volunteering or asking
you how I get to be a part of that because
[SPEAKER_04]: I am a legal grower and I'm a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a black market guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I can set a good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more than once I've fantasized about
being able to kidnap and hood a member of
[SPEAKER_00]: city government and sneak them through
your backyard and be like, this is what it
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like when it's done right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what legal looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what following the rules looks
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because unless you've blown your house up
or you've set your garage on fire or
[SPEAKER_00]: overloaded a transformer behind your
house, they've never come to your home.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was Mike's main point to city
council.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, the guys you're messing with are
not the medical caregivers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are commercial growers that are
making a weed crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're making those rules to enforce upon
medical caregivers and you're totally
[SPEAKER_04]: missing the point.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they caught on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we've got more time to deal with
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get on that committee, work it out,
let them know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a handful of us that are
scrambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're listening to this show and you
are interested in cannabis advocacy,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can find me on Twitter, Nemopunk15,
just like it sounds, N-E-M-O-P-U-N-K-1-5.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just created a Facebook page with
somebody else at one of the meetings
[SPEAKER_00]: brought up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be great if we had a Facebook page
where we could kick out community activism
[SPEAKER_00]: info and organize people for when the
meetings are because all of that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: very confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're in an anti-Facebook mood,
but I feel kind of bad because I spaced
[SPEAKER_00]: the name of the freaking Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't remember your own Facebook page?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure it's Pueblo for Sensible
Cannabis Laws or Cannabis Regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember how I worded it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw it the other night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure that's close.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a dab rig and there's one in
Arms Reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: My memories are further than they should
be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me cut you off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that for the listeners,
this might sound like if you're out of
[SPEAKER_02]: state or if you're out of Pueblo,
you're like, oh man, these guys are just
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about hometown stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys got to watch those city council
and wherever you're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: A, local politics is interesting because
it's the stuff that most affects you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you should be kind of keeping an eye on
your local council anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And B, if you're trying to legalize
marijuana on any level, getting the people
[SPEAKER_00]: that are elected right above you is the
place to start.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was more of what I wanted to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that there was probably some people
like, ugh, because I know I was.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I just wanted to say- I was speeding
them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was speeding them up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Mike mentioned we're in an F Facebook
mode.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm iRegenetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had 5,000 Facebook friends and I had
close to seven to 10,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't pay attention to the number.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're about seven to 10,000 followers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Facebook decided to close my damn
page.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eat it, Facebook.
[SPEAKER_04]: God damn it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was Clint over there with the Fs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So charge him the five, not me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please don't overcharge me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just don't confuse the voices.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Facebook, dude, come on, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eat a dick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why'd you do that to me?
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not on Facebook as much as I used
to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just going to go look for Mike's
Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I log into Facebook and all I can
do is look at shit that people that have
[SPEAKER_04]: liked my shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't really go comment.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't like, I can't post.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, because of the page.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can post, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I can't like go comment.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't troll and have the fun of being on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_04]: Facebook is being a troll and you can't go
troll people anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you won't see it on Facebook,
but check me out.

[SPEAKER_04]: You'll get there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not all there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figure it'll be about a year or two
before it starts really rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as it does, they'll take it
away.

[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck them.

[SPEAKER_04]: Just go check him out and support him,
please.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks a lot, Ryan.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's enough commercials.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like doing the commercials in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't overload them at the start.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you listen to a lot of podcasts like I
do, I like that you break it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get off that subject.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's some more commercials.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like watching TV or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I learned to do them at the beginning like
Rogan does because I prefer you don't,
[SPEAKER_04]: but if you want to, you can just skip
right through them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just go about two minutes in,
you're right past all the commercials.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you look on my table, I've not been
paid for this yet, but there may be in the
[SPEAKER_04]: future.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ordered Nature Box.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I approve of Nature Box.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do not sponsor the show in any way
yet, but that shit's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: It tastes good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good serving sizes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been replacing my sugary desires with
something from Nature Box and I feel
[SPEAKER_04]: better, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: My teeth aren't going to rot away as
quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: My guts aren't going to die.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to get diabetes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that shit is good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's tasty.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't go to the store and buy that
because at the store, this sounds like a
[SPEAKER_04]: paid commercial, dude, but this is the
truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the store, there's chocolate covered
this, there's chocolate covered that,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's crispy this, there's creamy,
and oh man.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you just, I want the chocolatey one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want all of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then when Nature Box sends you a box
of like, there was tomato basil covered
[SPEAKER_04]: almonds in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of into that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's crack one open.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, can you use that box?
[SPEAKER_02]: Listeners, don't go there yet because
we're going to get you a promo code on the
[SPEAKER_02]: next episode because this is our promo for
the commercial for Nature Box.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really am not sponsored by these guys,
but it's such a good idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all about taking care of myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, go for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one is called Coconut Cashews.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll all have a couple of coconut
cashews.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll eat on a podcast like for Joey Diaz
or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not already severe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to mouth fuck the fucking
microphone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you hear he got a comment from a
listener that said, I'm not going to see
[SPEAKER_04]: you tonight because you chew on Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that was on Diaz's podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: This should sound great on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: And while I take a couple of them,
I'm going to, right before I'm going to
[SPEAKER_04]: ask Clint, Clint came to the show because
he wants to talk about not professional
[SPEAKER_04]: grade weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had some questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, I'm not a pro and your weed
kills me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I'm seriously like, I'll take one
hit of a bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like even right now, I took one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys saw how minimal I took of that
one and it's fucking me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I got all quiet when you were
talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm just going to level with you
because I'm, it's just, it's too strong,
[SPEAKER_02]: too fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've only been smoking for two months.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need rocket fuel yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I need fucking, give me that unleaded
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That 309 fucking number 85 fucking.
[SPEAKER_02]: The 85 octane and not the turbo boost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please do not put nitrous in my fucking.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't want to take a half gram dab?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm not touching dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you guys, but you can go shove it,
brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can put that hot meal in your ass,
boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to touch it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's scary.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the thing is, is I'm getting like a
huge high off of one hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, and I know we've said this
since before I was smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: We said start slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if I think here at a couple of
minutes, like it didn't hit me well
[SPEAKER_02]: enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might take another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not doing that today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to work tonight, but that's the
thing is I need to know how do I get my
[SPEAKER_02]: handsome on some like mediocre weed unless
I'm growing or finding it in the ditch
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: My smart ass answer is just go to the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just look at all their jars and pick the
one that smells like, Hey, or maybe you
[SPEAKER_04]: need something more high in CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also, but well, STHC would be
beneficial for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not alone here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a ton of people that have either
avoided marijuana because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: legalities or, you know, for whatever
reason and are now walking into a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary going, and yeah, they've a
rookie cookie is the product name that
[SPEAKER_00]: sticks in my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was an article about it,
the Denver post not too long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that an actual Colorado product?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure that is a product that's
sitting on Colorado dispensary is not to
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a spectacular name, the rookie
cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I walked in as a 55 year old dude into
a dispensary and hadn't really consumed
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw rookie cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like clap and laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have rookie weed too?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, they've starting to stock it in a
number of dispensaries from what I
[SPEAKER_00]: understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: The demand is huge for they want regular
weed, not back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to be 21 to smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get all these kids turning 21 and
they're like, well, it's legal now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can go do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can go out to the bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can join the military.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can go smoke some pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just, I don't want kids starting
like with, with some goddamn Bruce Banner
[SPEAKER_02]: that'll fucking knock me down my ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or that Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll kick my ass.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll set you down for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like four hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't do anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I'm just like, all right,
I guess I'm going through the cosmos right
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_04]: My mom used to smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to smoke occasionally, not to bust
my mom out, but back in the day,
[SPEAKER_04]: my mom's fucking hippie dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: She used to smoke weed back in the day and
she slowly quit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she hasn't smoked for years now that
she's got a good job and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I joke with her every occasionally,
you know, like you want to smoke joint
[SPEAKER_04]: mom?
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's like, I would, but your,
your weed's too damn strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's like the last time I smoked with you
guys, it was just hell.
[SPEAKER_04]: She used to love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: She was a pothead dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: She used to wake and bake.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I remember when I was little,
her and my uncles would hang out and smoke
[SPEAKER_04]: joints all day long.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now she's like, nope, that weed gets
me too high.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my uncles are the same way too.
[SPEAKER_04]: They used to be, that's where I learned my
shit was from my uncles that were potheads
[SPEAKER_04]: and party animals.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now, now they're like, dude,
you're crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: That weed's too good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's too good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of funny.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and then you're going to get those
guys that used to smoke eight joints and
[SPEAKER_02]: not get high back in the seventies because
it was dirt weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they come and they're like,
well, shit, I can smoke a whole joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would I even be worried about it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been 20 years, so they have zero
tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden they're thinking,
oh, this is going to be the same thing as
[SPEAKER_00]: that fucking dirt weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go home, roll a joint, take five hits
and get halfway through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, by then it's too far.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Colorado rules, the laws say that
they're supposed to have every product
[SPEAKER_04]: tested, even the buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they should have a THC level printed on
the jars.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the shops aren't complying.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just can't afford it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's not enough testing facilities.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once we get to that point, you need
something like closer to 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: What you've been smoking is in the 20
range, 20%.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've grown herb that's tested in the 27.
[SPEAKER_04]: Spence actually hit 29.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you grow that?
[SPEAKER_04]: He grew that, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Rhian's Rhino from Seed that Spence
grew.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to the guy who grew weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to fucking Spence.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also shout out to Steep Hill Halent Labs.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're the ones that test our stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: They did a good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's what I'm getting at is like,
there's just, like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that was more of my question was
like, is there a strain that you would
[SPEAKER_02]: recommend to a newbie?
Flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: No?
[SPEAKER_02]: Flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: F-L-O.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I threw it out real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just happens to be the one that I reuse
to grow regularly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a perfect high.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a nice, it's like a 50-50 hybrid.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cut that I have is, I feel like it's a
50-50 hybrid.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not too overpowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a good body high.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a good head high.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for me, it doesn't hit me hard enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: I almost got rid of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of my friends are like,
dude, you got to grow the flow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's still here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flow is what I liked for days for a long
time when you've got a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff to do but can't be in pain all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd grow up a little flow for the morning
and I'd be good all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't near as powerful as what I
wanted for evenings, but maybe like some
[SPEAKER_00]: rookies.
Jilly bean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jilly bean might be good for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just something to maintain, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm not trying to get all fucking
blasted and go take a nap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I got to do the laundry.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like speaking of laundry,
these cashews, was that almonds or
[SPEAKER_02]: cashews?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're coconut cashews.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are delicious, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nature box all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I set them down because I wanted to have
one at a time because I loved it so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I'm a guy who has listened to
Rogan's podcast and everybody's podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: that says, oh, go get nature's box.
[SPEAKER_02]: This converted me right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go home and if I can remember
and not be high, I'm going to fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: order me some.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll get the munchies and you'd be like,
oh, I should order nature box.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, what was the name of that thing that
we were talking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why doesn't that episode come out already?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what happened to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear Rogan and Diaz talking about it all
the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think Nerdist even promotes nature
box.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they did a free thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, if you order now,
it's free.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get a free box.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't pay anything for this box of
munchies that were eaten.
[SPEAKER_04]: They came straight to the door,
but now every month I'm going to get a box
[SPEAKER_04]: for 1995.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's like proactive, but I think
it's worth what I would go pay.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the Columbia house of snacks.
[SPEAKER_04]: First one's free.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted everybody to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all, we were all going to stop for a
second and eat.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it was just like, no,
dude, this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I approve nature box.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, uh, nature box.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're listening, contact me for a
sponsorship, because I support your
[SPEAKER_04]: product and it would work well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you hear that awesome ad we just did?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we actually just pumped you up a
lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been recording for a long time and
Mike has some news.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we're going to put Mike on again.
[SPEAKER_04]: So save me a couple of minutes to read a
couple of listener comments, but tell us
[SPEAKER_04]: about the new cannabis news that you were
telling me about when he first showed up
[SPEAKER_00]: to the house, the local, uh, profits and
such.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the, the local Pueblo city budget came
out this week and the city seems to think
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to get 500,000 worth of
marijuana taxes just for the next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the, the actual city of Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_04]: So wait for the punchline.
[SPEAKER_00]: The punchline to that is, is the,
the number that they're going to get next
[SPEAKER_00]: year is zero, not 500,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's zero instead of 500,000,
because we don't have any marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually have to actually have to have
a marijuana business located in your city
[SPEAKER_00]: to enjoy taxes from those businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Pueblo County has already made
about 500 grand this year between the rec
[SPEAKER_00]: shops and the medical shops, the local tax
and the little kickback that the state
[SPEAKER_00]: sends on the statewide tax.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I've looked most of city council in
the face recently.
[SPEAKER_04]: They seem like an intelligent group of
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are they predicting this money comes
from if we're not allowed to have a
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensary?
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the city manager puts that budget
together and hands it to city council.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of the meeting we saw the
other night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're probably looking at it,
thinking the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone in Pueblo that read the chieftain
today and the three of us are thinking is,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, if it's really zero, cause we don't
have any marijuana businesses,
[SPEAKER_00]: where's this 500,000 number coming from?
[SPEAKER_04]: The irony in that is I honestly,
I rarely go to city council meetings and I
[SPEAKER_04]: will now I'm an anxious person and I felt
intimidated to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've broken the ice and I'm not afraid
anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll see me there more often.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remind me where I was headed with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, right at the beginning, one of their
first things was, and we're proud to
[SPEAKER_04]: announce it last week where our budget was
like $484,000 or a million dollars short,
[SPEAKER_04]: but we've presented to you a balanced
budget this week.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's one of the things we fixed in
our work sessions, but they didn't really
[SPEAKER_04]: present a balanced budget.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they just revealed their secret.
[SPEAKER_04]: They added in $500,000 that they're not
going to get.
[SPEAKER_04]: They made it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm a little worried about is if that
500 grand pot number was in there before
[SPEAKER_00]: they carved out the three and a half
million or whatever that they carved out
[SPEAKER_00]: over the last week, they might've been
four million short and they only filled
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole three and a half million worth
because they're pretending there's another
[SPEAKER_00]: half million that's going to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed man's ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that you have to have a pot
store.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they would let a couple of dispensaries
build within city limits, the licensing
[SPEAKER_04]: alone is 300 or I think it's like $3,000
for one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each license you have to have several,
depending on what you're doing is five
[SPEAKER_00]: grand to the city and the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's essentially 10 grand to do just to
grow, 10 grand to do the store,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 grand to do the hash making.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if they open five shops, they'd make 25
G's right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Minimum.
[SPEAKER_02]: The city's already taken in about five
shops would be 50 G's.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you mean, I see what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem with that though is what
they're worried about is that you can't
[SPEAKER_02]: just allow one because that's a monopoly
and you can't just allow five because
[SPEAKER_02]: that's still a monopoly in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't say, oh, you got here too late.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not allowed to start.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the American way.
[SPEAKER_04]: This town doesn't really need more than,
and this sounds ridiculous coming from me,
[SPEAKER_04]: but if a shop did it right, three or four
shops would be more than enough for this
[SPEAKER_04]: city.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree, but that's on the businesses to
decide later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, oh, you know, I don't think we can
make money by starting one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we're going to get influx of
five.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden it's going to be
like, wow, we're, we're, we're all not
[SPEAKER_02]: doing great, but this guy's not doing well
at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he closes down and it's,
we're going to see that one of these days,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to see the first pot shop
closed down.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be like, that's weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if a liquor store goes out,
we're like, oh, we get it because there's
[SPEAKER_02]: a liquor store on every, every corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do it, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean it up the airwaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but what I'm saying is like,
we see a liquor store on every,
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's a bar on every other one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we see all these liquor stores and a
liquor store goes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like, oh yeah, of course it did.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's super competition.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's gonna happen with weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so prices are going to have to start
dropping and that's better for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in Washington right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at $60 and change for a
gram of legal marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: The look you two just gave me is the look
that you should have given me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're paying $60 for a gram of
marijuana, you need to slap yourself in
[SPEAKER_02]: the face with your own penis.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to listen to a good podcast that
teaches you how to grow and provide your
[SPEAKER_04]: own cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you need to go to naturesgreen
remedies.com and use coupon code helping
[SPEAKER_04]: hands and order yourself some freaking
high grade seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I recommend irie genetics, gauge green
genetics, or maybe some alpha chronic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually watched what you're talking
about with pot stores closing and the
[SPEAKER_00]: price dropping with medical over the last
decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when January 1st that the whole
clock reset, they just wound it back to
[SPEAKER_00]: 2004, moving pots back to 450.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's this place that's got $60 grams.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that because of a supply and demand
thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the shops in Washington,
there's a very few shops that are open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their supply is extremely limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't have the time to bring in the
crops before this all went live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like with the licensing, you weren't
allowed to grow for very long before shops
[SPEAKER_00]: were allowed to open.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just haven't had any time in a
year or two when shop numbers have risen
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly, production numbers have had
a time to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that will change a bit,
but it's going to be a year or two before
[SPEAKER_00]: you can buy a reasonable gram legally in
Washington.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seattle has no idea what's coming to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a little secret right now,
Seattle.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got some good shit coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they deserve it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited and I'm proud for Seattle and
for what's happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be a great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super excited for who we're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really disappointed that it's
happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll make the announcement closer to the
start of the year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, we've got some cool news for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of cool stuff coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not really our announcement to
make.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we'll have those people on the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be dope.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dope.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Mike, you got your news out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Clint, you got to ask about, well,
you just got to find some shitty weed,
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to go to- Man, we figured it out,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to bring you some.
[SPEAKER_02]: You brought me some good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm afraid.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that's the thing is I'm always
constantly afraid of whatever I get too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, so is this going to kill me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this the one that sends me into a panic
or something like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, so far, I've gotten really
fucking high and I haven't had this huge
[SPEAKER_02]: bad trip or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you're probably not going to.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's the thing is I can talk myself
out of them because I know I'm on drugs
[SPEAKER_02]: right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand it's not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but I mean, as high as you're getting,
it probably feels that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get fucked up, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be able to remind yourself
that cannabis can't kill humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more than my mantra before.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're too high, now you're just
killing cancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ain't got cancer for shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're too high, your cancer's too high
also.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just going backwards, going,
I don't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not cancer anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just starts dying.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm making all of that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff is not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to let you guys know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Surprisingly, you would never have
guessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does not count as a medical opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Clint is talking about getting too
wrecked off of like a bowl of too good a
[SPEAKER_04]: weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And last night I did a gram dab and I
honestly have not been that high since I
[SPEAKER_04]: did a half gram dab recently.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it took me, no, you remember on the
show when I ate that 350 milligram edible,
[SPEAKER_04]: I was nearly, I was equally high,
but in a different way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like red-eyed and stoned.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was Chinese.
[SPEAKER_04]: Last night after that gram dab,
when I ate that edible, I was,
[SPEAKER_04]: I felt like I was on energy drugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was jumping around and giddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't jump around.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no giddy last night.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to giddy up since I keep saying
giddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bumped into him on Chatroulette and it
was really funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had his pants on.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stunners and people jerking off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two dudes staring at each other,
smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you doing while I was about to
hit this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we both came on and we go,
Hey, because we recognized each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I held up my rig and he held up
his rig and we just started laughing like,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, taking dabs on Chatroulette.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like everyone else has their wiener out on
that channel and it's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're into online chatting with other
stoners, there's a thing called Puff Puff
[SPEAKER_00]: Chat that I've heard about in a number of
places, but I haven't actually attempted
[SPEAKER_00]: to enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to keep up with somebody who just
set a TV to fast forward just to fuck with
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they're just dogging on these fucking
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, Oh, I can't keep up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this, this little tiny chick is
kicking my ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no tolerance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'd be, I'd be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Puff Puff.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was called Puff Puff Chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last time I got online for something
that was designed for stoners to come
[SPEAKER_00]: together and get stoned on webcams
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got shut down like an hour after it
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the DEA showed up and we're like,
what are you all doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Videoing yourself committing crimes,
huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: This sounds fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't prove it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oregano.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oregano.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: My Facebook page used to say, this is all
an illusion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing you see here is real.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we live in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do live in Colorado and I take dabs and
I've got the legal allowed amount of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't give a shit right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to start wrapping it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're close to an hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, you got any plugs or any shit to
wrap the show up with?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a blank stare.
[SPEAKER_04]: Clint, you start thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have had some notes about when
the next commissioner meeting or when the
[SPEAKER_00]: next city council meeting is, but I don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, if you are a cannabis supporter in
the city of Pueblo, Colorado, the County
[SPEAKER_04]: of Pueblo, Colorado, please follow Mike
Nikon, not Nikon, Nemopunk, Nemopunk15 on
[SPEAKER_04]: Twitter.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's Nikon is what it comes up under the
name there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's confusing and obnoxious and a little
soft Mark, but at this point I'm proud of
[SPEAKER_00]: a handful of my followers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a couple of major news outlets follow
my retarded ass and I don't want to start
[SPEAKER_00]: over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to kind of bear that
Nemopunk15 cross.
[SPEAKER_04]: Find him on there because he will tweet
when all of the meetings are.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going to take that responsibility.
[SPEAKER_04]: The city council meetings that we need to
go to, the commissioner's meetings,
[SPEAKER_04]: the planning and zoning meetings.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it feels like there's a cannabis
presence needed, Mike will start tweeting
[SPEAKER_04]: that stuff out for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Igraculture will start retweeting that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have a little community action.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tall Clint will help.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tall Clint, it's your turn buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find me on Facebook and Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tall Clint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tall Clint.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all, I just stuck with the same thing
because I want to brand it, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It works well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tall Clint.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm tall and I'm Clint.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you don't think it's Cliff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked like another word the first time
I saw it on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It did not look like it said Clint.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no N in the words you're thinking
of or- There is an N in the word you're
[SPEAKER_04]: thinking of.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're thinking of when the L and the I
become a U?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like the L and the I had united
to a U.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it was going to be in my name,
it makes complete sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I thought, I think I said that
word on the show earlier, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you did.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: I may edit that word out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never said that on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't say the F one, but that one,
that's weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're not trying to offend people
and people get offended by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a charity, hit Ross to Jeff up
to take another cuss word out of this
[SPEAKER_00]: vocabulary.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, since everyone's doing plugs,
check me out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I no longer have the iRegenetics Facebook
page.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Follow at iGrowCulture on Instagram and
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_04]: iGrowCulture has a Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, you can follow me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've started posting dab videos and weed
pictures on at Rasta Jeff 420.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was hard to say for some reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to give a couple of shout outs.
[SPEAKER_04]: People left me some really cool comments
on iTunes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys for leaving the iTunes
comments.
[SPEAKER_04]: This first comment is from hippie nurse
710.
[SPEAKER_04]: What up hippie nurse?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're having a rough day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope listening to the podcast and
hearing a shout out makes you smile.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got a rough job and I appreciate
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: What you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's a nurse at night, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: God, I have so much respect for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: She doesn't know how much respect I have
for it, but maybe she will now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Her comment says, and she gave us five
stars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Her comment says, I have been a listener
since episode one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can hear a difference in the tone,
quality and flow of each episode as you
[SPEAKER_04]: progress.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are getting better and better
with each episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that you keep it light and
informative.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes it easier for newbies like myself
to understand, keep up the good work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we're aiming for.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks a lot, hippie nurse.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Since episode one, she used to always,
she would tweet me and message me like,
[SPEAKER_04]: when is the new episode coming?
[SPEAKER_04]: When is the new episode coming?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, it comes out at seven 10
in the morning on Mondays.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she said, I work nights.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can it come out at four 20 AM?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now it comes out.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why it pops up kind of randomly
late at night on Sundays so that she can
[SPEAKER_04]: listen to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: They shift at work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we do for the listeners.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she sent us a nice comment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: It works out well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you're doing well, hippie nurse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need some more five stars guys,
please.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we got another one.
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy, Billy Bob Ray.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's Billy Bobo Ray.
[SPEAKER_04]: Billy Bobo Ray.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Billy Bobo Ray.
[SPEAKER_04]: That could be the guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Charles Manson.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's not just from Oregon or South
Carolina.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or a Bobo Shanty Rastafarian.
[SPEAKER_00]: All possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or his middle name could be Bobo also.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have the same problem I have
with a bad handle though, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he says, Rasta Jeff is fun to listen
to, but be prepared for some stoner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Moments like, where was this conversation
going?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what were we talking about?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey dude, that happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're smoking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Award winning hash, award winning flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think he was being disparaging on
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think it was kind of just a,
here you go guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't take offense to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's accurate shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm high.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's part of the fun of the whole thing
though.
[SPEAKER_04]: I sometimes random shit is where the good
shit comes out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to script almost everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to type out a lot of what I was
going to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I listened to the episodes and it
felt like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for listening to I Grow Culture
podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Jeff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I write bullet points and try to
rant on those bullet points and keep it
[SPEAKER_04]: moving because it feels a lot better.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that does create those stoner moments.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: How's he doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Billy Bobo Ray?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's what he wrote.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what he wrote.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he gave us four stars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's cool enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four works.
[SPEAKER_02]: I passed middle school with a 60.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is way better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for leaving a comment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Billy Bobo Ray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Billy Bobo Ray.
[SPEAKER_00]: We apologize for butchering your name
repeatedly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm high and making it fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not butchering it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got me entertained as shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we had any where's this
going moments this episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this whole episode was a where the
hell is this going moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like Jeff was trying to drag me
back to the point like for an hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, just not an hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, there's a couple good
minutes in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, I hope you heard me trying to put
him back on track.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got on Nature Box for at least 10
minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those fucking almonds were great.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We already sold that product.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go, Bobo.
[SPEAKER_04]: I fixed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saved it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish that I could get my Nature Box at
Hygro indoor growing supplies.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to wrap this up, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have Jesse coming back in a couple of
episodes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if he'll be back this week or
in about 10 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's hard to get here.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a busy man.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's married.
[SPEAKER_04]: He works several jobs.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's an awesome dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's worth waiting for.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're going to discuss building your
grow room.
[SPEAKER_04]: People have asked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, a listener said that they have a
$500 budget and they would like to learn
[SPEAKER_04]: how to grow a small grow room to supply
themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a couple of good ideas on how that
might work.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to work on that for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll put an episode together.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a couple of news articles that I
did not read on this show.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they'll be coming up in the next
episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys for listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to read that part that I read at
the end of the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that the show is over, please go to
iTunes, go to the iTunes store,
[SPEAKER_04]: search for Hygro Culture, find the review
section, give me a five or a four star
[SPEAKER_04]: rating.

know what you think of the show and I'll
[SPEAKER_04]: read your comments on the show.

same thing.

iTunes, Stitcher, and every single episode
[SPEAKER_04]: is archived on iregeneticscolorado.com.

[SPEAKER_04]: If you're interested, join the forum.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will communicate with you through that

[SPEAKER_04]: Since Facebook kind of gave me the middle
finger, I spend a lot more time on the
[SPEAKER_04]: forum.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm also adding videos to YouTube.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, they're nothing fancy.
[SPEAKER_04]: As I get caught up, the videos are getting

guys next time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Joining me on the microphone today is
Jesse from Hygro.
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_05]: How's it going, guys?
[SPEAKER_05]: Doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_04]: In this episode, Jesse and I are going to
talk a little bit about building your grow
[SPEAKER_04]: space.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, this may end up being a
multi-episode discussion because I know
[SPEAKER_04]: we're going to leave stuff out.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to forget things.
[SPEAKER_04]: We took quite a few notes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We wrote quite a bit of stuff down.
[SPEAKER_04]: The more I wrote, the more I feel like we
were missing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to try to keep notes on what
we're missing while we go, and we'll keep
[SPEAKER_04]: this conversation going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we get to that part, we got to pay
some bills.

[SPEAKER_04]: They took really good care of me on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got some OGT.

[SPEAKER_04]: Big love to our friends at Treethug.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's enough commercials for today.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get on with some show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse and I are here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Last night, Jesse hosted a small gathering
for growers over at Hygro.
[SPEAKER_04]: The party was a huge success, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great response, great turnout.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was really stoked about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't really advertise.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse didn't advertise much.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of a test run.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just wanted to kind of see what would
happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: He wanted to see what would happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had about 12 people there for most of
the evening.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd say about 20 people showed up for the
peak of the night when Spence and Matty
[SPEAKER_04]: and Big Mike and Michael showed up.
[SPEAKER_04]: That made about 20 people in the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to everybody that came,
the people that I met, the people that I
[SPEAKER_04]: already knew.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for coming and supporting something
like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big huge thanks to Bern.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bern and Jesse and Hygro for letting us
gather in the store.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a great time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had some pizza.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had some pizza.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for feeding me, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Last night was kind of just a test run to
see how many people we could get to show
[SPEAKER_04]: up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So do you plan on doing this more?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to set a date real soon for
next month, probably on Monday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Try to make it like a monthly event.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's invited?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can anybody come?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 21 and up, but anyone's welcome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone who's invited, just come down to
the store and ask for info or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you make a Facebook page or anything
for it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a Facebook event.
Oh, just an invite?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I can do it from the
iReGenetics page or from the iGrowCulture
[SPEAKER_04]: page, but I can do it from my personal,
I'll make an event or I'll share Jesse's
[SPEAKER_04]: event as soon as the next one comes up and
we'll talk about it on the show and we'll
[SPEAKER_04]: let you guys know.
[SPEAKER_04]: We hope to get more growers from the
Pueblo area coming out to the gathering.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll announce it for sure when we get it
figured out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully we can get some listeners out
there and meet the people.
[SPEAKER_04]: They come shake our hands and we can find
out who we're talking to.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Armando, we want you to come to one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were talking about building your
grow rooms and last night there were
[SPEAKER_04]: actually some new growers at the party and
we got to help them build a pretty sweet
[SPEAKER_04]: room.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of nice to, they're like,
we don't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Jesse and I looked at each other and
it was neat because we had the exact same
[SPEAKER_04]: idea in our heads.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're like, do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they pretty much are going to do that,
I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in this show, we're going to talk about
a few different ways to set up a grow
[SPEAKER_04]: space that is suitable for your production
needs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also found a comment on the Facebook
page that asks for guidance in building a
[SPEAKER_04]: space for $500.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a really tight budget for a grow
room, but I'll see what I can come up
[SPEAKER_04]: with.
[SPEAKER_04]: I Googled a few items to try to save some
pennies, but that's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_04]: You had 500 bucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: How big is the space?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, she just said, help me out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Teach me how to build a space for 500
bucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: She said she's on a very low budget.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have her Facebook comment.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd have to read to remember exactly what
she said, but I think she's also disabled.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to have to build her
something that's not heavy.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have an idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's accessible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to build like a PVC frame and
then wrap it in some sort of Mylar type
[SPEAKER_04]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then maybe hang a small T5 light in
there and that'll get her going.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk more about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get that going once we get into the
building, the grow stuff a little more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about building.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a few things to consider when
you're going to plan your grow before you
[SPEAKER_04]: even go to the hardware store,
before you ever go to the hydro shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's stuff you got to think about.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first thing to think about in my
opinion is, is it legal where you are?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to help you break the law.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first part of this is move to a
location where cannabis is legal if you
[SPEAKER_04]: want to follow my rules.
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't do this in an illegal state.
[SPEAKER_04]: Move to Colorado, go to California,
or even better, do what you can to get
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis legalized or decriminalized where
you are so that you can grow legally.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to be responsible for you
breaking the law.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you plan on breaking the law,
just change to another podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want you to go to jail for what
I'm telling you, but you're going to do
[SPEAKER_04]: what you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the next thing to think about,
understand the risk you're taking because
[SPEAKER_04]: if you're growing in a state that's not
legal, the consequences can be quite
[SPEAKER_04]: severe.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're putting at risk.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're growing in a house, everybody in
that house is in trouble.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have a family and you go to jail,
that's going to just cause a tidal wave of
[SPEAKER_04]: bullshit in your life.
[SPEAKER_04]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next thing that I would say to think
about is what are your realistic needs?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're committed, you're going to grow
some cannabis for yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are your realistic needs?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you need to grow for yourself,
your family, maybe a few patients,
[SPEAKER_04]: or are you trying to become the next big
production facility in your area?
[SPEAKER_04]: So my next idea would be set a goal and
kind of stick with that for a few cycles
[SPEAKER_04]: to see what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't, you're not going to know how
good of a grower or what kind of crop you
[SPEAKER_04]: get on the first grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stick with that, set something up,
stick with it for a couple of cycles,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then adjust to your needs after you've
gone a couple of rounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like don't run your first lap and then
think, my shoes are too tight,
[SPEAKER_04]: my shoes are too loose.
[SPEAKER_04]: Run a couple of laps, see what you're good
at, then adjust.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my next thing to consider, I would say,
is does your location have viable
[SPEAKER_04]: electricity?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something Jesse really stressed on
when he got here to talk about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Running more than one or two thousand watt
lights in a room may require some
[SPEAKER_04]: electrical upgrades if you want to be
safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: If your breakers are flipping and you're
scrambling to keep everything running,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's when you're creating a fire hazard.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you don't want to be on the news for
burning down your house growing weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: In your experience, can you usually just
run like a thousand watt light,
[SPEAKER_04]: the blower that it requires, and a couple
of fans?
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you have like a hydro bubbler or
whatever, is that pretty much what one
[SPEAKER_04]: room can do?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, most residential rooms have about 30
amps.
[SPEAKER_04]: A 30 amp breaker.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's your, and if you're putting an
air conditioner in there, you're taking up
[SPEAKER_04]: half a breaker just with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The light takes up about half a breaker.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're flipping the breaker when you
turn on the dishwasher or whatever,
[SPEAKER_04]: have an electrician come and help you out.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a lot of electricians.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, if you're in the Pueblo area,
I have an electrician that I will refer
[SPEAKER_04]: because he's looking for some work.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's off and he could use your job.
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't burn down the house, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please don't burn down the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't create that fire hazard with
electricity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, if you're in an illegal state,
this is something I just thought of,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're going to have to have an excuse for
all that electricity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: If your 1000 watt light is going to kick
your light bill up about a hundred dollars
[SPEAKER_04]: per month, an additional, like the light
and the fan and the blower it takes to run
[SPEAKER_04]: it, you're looking about another hundred
dollars every month.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're just a dude in an apartment or
something like that, that may spark some
[SPEAKER_04]: concerns.
[SPEAKER_04]: You might want to get a hot tub.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've heard of people using welding
equipment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just get something to kind of make it look
like you're doing something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put a bunch of table saws in the garage if
you've got that option.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, look like you have somewhere for
that power consumption to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Empty, empty saltwater fish tanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, all of that stuff,
I bet you they can tell that my timers are
[SPEAKER_04]: on 1212 over at the Crow.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they're like, oh yeah,
every day at eight o'clock, this guy kicks
[SPEAKER_04]: on thousands of Watts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then every day at eight o'clock,
they kick off.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not retarded.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry if retarded is an offensive word to
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So will you be able to ventilate your
space is the next thing I would think
[SPEAKER_04]: about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fresh air is super important.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stale, stagnant, humid air is the number
one cause for power to remill do.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll also slow your growth and makes your
plants look ugly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes room sneak.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to be able to walk into your grow
room and close your eyes and not smell
[SPEAKER_04]: pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want it to smell like a nice clean
room.
[SPEAKER_04]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to be able to ventilate that
space.
[SPEAKER_04]: Number five on my list of things that you
should consider.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is your grow space safe and secure?
[SPEAKER_04]: You may need to hide your grow from the
landlord or your nosy in-laws that come
[SPEAKER_04]: over for dinner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you ready to live the grow life in
your house?
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't sound like a huge question,
but dude, when you've got pot plants in
[SPEAKER_04]: your house, your whole house will stink if
you don't have it under control.
[SPEAKER_04]: You might need some carbon filters.
[SPEAKER_04]: You might need an extra carbon filter or
two.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always have a carbon filter on the air
that is going out, the exhaust,
[SPEAKER_04]: but then also I'll hang a carbon filter
with the blower on it, just right in the
[SPEAKER_04]: middle of the room on the ceiling to act
as a scrubber, just to clean even more
[SPEAKER_04]: air.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that eliminates more odor.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were talking about ONA gel last night.
[SPEAKER_04]: They sell ONA gels in like a plastic jar.
[SPEAKER_04]: They say to take the lid off and just
leave it sitting, but I actually poke
[SPEAKER_04]: little pencil-sized holes with the drill
right in the lid and then just let it sit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then once it gets down to about a
third of the jar, I just add like a half a
[SPEAKER_04]: cup of water in there and shake it and it
rehydrates all the crystals and it lasts a
[SPEAKER_04]: little longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put those by your door, like your entryway
to your home or your entryway to wherever
[SPEAKER_04]: you're growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people's nose will hit that first.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now their nose has already kind of,
they've been punched, so they're confused.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when they smell the herb, they won't
know that it's herb, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can put them inside your ducting
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll blow that, move that odor around
instead of the cannabis odor.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to add a random side note.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just a really random sidebar
because I just thought about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I keep hearing a lot of people say the
word marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: Marijuana is a racist word and it sounds
bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: People are afraid of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis is the new word.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis sounds better.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't sound as racist.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that's a weird way to put it,
but we were taught that marijuana is the
[SPEAKER_04]: devil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you smell marijuana, you're going
to get crazy and rape white bitches.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis will heal you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis stops cancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we should just try to abandon
the word marijuana and say cannabis a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: more.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just my random sidebar for the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Marijuana actually literally is a racist
word.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't doubt that, people.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was invented by the government to
discriminate against Mexicans.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't like the Mexicans that were
coming to America and smoking marijuana
[SPEAKER_04]: and then bringing it to the jazz
musicians.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all Reefer Madness, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully you know about that already and
hopefully you're not that brainwashed and
[SPEAKER_04]: you never paid attention to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully you just call it cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Safe and secure grow space, live in the
grow life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another big thing to consider is the
location of your grow inside of your house
[SPEAKER_04]: or wherever you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The basement is generally the coolest
spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're insulated by dirt and concrete
walls in your underground.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't get a lot of climate changes
there in the basement.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, hopefully you don't get a lot of
traffic down there in the basement.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got like one room, in the corner,
in the back or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can just dedicate.
[SPEAKER_04]: The attic is going to get hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: The attic is the top of the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's getting hit by the sun.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have all this insulation from
the dirt and the concrete walls.
[SPEAKER_04]: The attic is going to be a little more
challenging.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're going to need more cooling
power.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to adjust.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your snow melts off the, or the snow melts
off your roof in the middle of the winter
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's the only house in the
neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're the only house that your roof is
clean because you just melt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had to make an adjustment because I
noticed that I was melting snow somewhere
[SPEAKER_04]: one year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, oh, that's obvious as shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also guys, this is something we'll cover a
little later, but I want to jump to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to get water there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So putting your plants in the attic,
once you get all the grow equipment hung
[SPEAKER_04]: up there and everything's up there,
now you have to get water up there often.
[SPEAKER_04]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then another, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got something to add?
[SPEAKER_05]: Attic, if you can avoid it, it's just
really not a good place to grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually a pretty good fire hazard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's a significant fire hazard.
[SPEAKER_05]: So avoid the attic at all costs.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're in like Wisconsin or something
though, and you can't really do it like we
[SPEAKER_04]: can here in Colorado, nobody goes to
anybody else's attic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that may be someone's only option.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, like we were talking about earlier,
be safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know this sounds cheesy as hell,
but safety first, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to be on the news for
burning down your house, growing pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when the news comes, you might've
been growing illegal medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: but as soon as that fire starts and the
news truck pulls out, you've got a drug
[SPEAKER_04]: lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not going to be polite.
[SPEAKER_04]: This medical marijuana provider
accidentally sparked fire to his home.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the report's going to say,
we're here in front of this house where
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a major drug lab on fire right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what the reports.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're going to be the asshole that
just went to jail for doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a nice news voice.
[SPEAKER_04]: You like that?
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounded really weird in the headphones.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to bail on it kind of quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, try to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lower in the house is better.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Pueblo, they're trying to actually push
an ordinance where we have to grow in an
[SPEAKER_04]: outbuilding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was reading a book doing research on
this, and in Jorge Cervantes book,
[SPEAKER_04]: he says outbuildings are actually the
worst place you could think about growing
[SPEAKER_04]: because that's where thieves are.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the cops don't consider that
trespassing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they can go into your outbuilding.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not part of your home.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the cops can walk right in.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a different rule.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not part of your domicile.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a shed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they can walk right into that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't need a warrant.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something we got to remind all the
people that are opposed to this of.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, did you just hear that, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: Your outbuilding that they're trying to
propose that we build will not be part of
[SPEAKER_04]: your home.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it will not require a warrant is what
this book that Jorge Cervantes wrote says.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me know how that really works.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's my legal counsel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Grown in a shed, it has a lot of
challenges too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's going to be a lot like grown in an
attic as far as trying to insulate it and
[SPEAKER_05]: cool it and all that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be very difficult.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess I should, one more thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next step here is how are you going to
cool the room?
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep in mind that you have to use more
electricity for that air conditioner and
[SPEAKER_04]: the air conditioner has to vent itself
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you keep in mind how you're going to
cool the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a good point that I wanted to make
and it just left my head.
[SPEAKER_04]: What were you just telling me?
[SPEAKER_05]: What was that with the sheds?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the sheds.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: What our goal is, I guess I should have
covered this more in the beginning,
[SPEAKER_04]: but your goal when you're building a grow
room, you want as much control of the
[SPEAKER_04]: lights, the air, the water, the humidity,
the temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to build a room that we can
control to set the ideal climate for these
[SPEAKER_04]: plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of just starting building a room,
we should know what we're trying to build,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want a room that you can almost
automate and let that happen and just turn
[SPEAKER_04]: everything on properly, get everything set
up properly and let it run.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when the nighttime comes,
you have a nighttime temperature selected.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll get to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: When the daytime comes again, you have a
daytime temp selected.
[SPEAKER_04]: The air conditioner kicks on at the right
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your fans move at the right time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your blowers are all at the right
schedule.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you can hit that perfect like 50%
humidity or 40% humidity mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get your 77 degree mark in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get it all perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can have just a little bit of wind.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're trying to build that super happy,
trying to build an aquarium for your
[SPEAKER_04]: plants or like a cage for plants,
like the perfect habitat for these plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: A subclimate inside your house?
[SPEAKER_04]: Inside your house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's your goal.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I should have talked more about
that at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once you achieve that pretty dialed in
perfect climate, growing becomes a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: easier, a lot, lot easier.
[SPEAKER_04]: The room, the genetics, what you're
feeding and then the grow, like how you
[SPEAKER_04]: grow, that's pretty much what your
components are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lights, air, water, soil and love.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cleanliness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cleanliness is next to godliness when it
comes to growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every little piece of trash or scrap and
not just in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_04]: If your grow room is in like your mom's
basement or your grandma's attic or your
[SPEAKER_04]: bedroom closet, all of those clothes and
all those books, all those scraps of
[SPEAKER_04]: paper, all those cigarette butts,
all the dust, that's all a place for a
[SPEAKER_04]: spider mite to hide.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all a place for a thrip to lay a
bug.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, all that dust and cigarette smoke
will end up in your concentrate and in
[SPEAKER_04]: your flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've kind of stopped sweeping my grow room
now after about week six because I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: want to stir up the dust and put it in my
flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will let my grow room look a little
shitty on the floor for a week to not
[SPEAKER_04]: sweep it up as often because I don't,
and I'll turn off all the fans and blowers
[SPEAKER_04]: and air conditioners now to sweep up
because I don't want that stick into my
[SPEAKER_04]: buds because that ends up in the hash and
we're trying to make the best hash we can
[SPEAKER_04]: now.
[SPEAKER_04]: That seems to be the point that
everybody's headed to.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still try to grow the best flowers,
but of course we want the best hash to go
[SPEAKER_04]: with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a long rant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than things to consider,
there are responsibilities that I think
[SPEAKER_04]: you should practice being a good grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're setting up to grow,
you don't want to piss off the neighbors.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to attract unwanted
attention by thieves or thugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to get cop attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something people don't think
about.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are kids out there that love to
steal pot plants now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kids are getting braver.
[SPEAKER_04]: The younger kids are getting dumber and
braver.
[SPEAKER_04]: They know what pot is.
[SPEAKER_04]: They know how to find a grow, and they
want to steal your shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are also innocent kids that will
just see your pot and want to steal it
[SPEAKER_04]: just because they're curious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep your pot away from the kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I stress that, but I'm a father,
so I don't want my kid finding your pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I needed a drink.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a long rant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the responsibilities that I think,
and I want to thank my friends on Facebook
[SPEAKER_04]: for helping me out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I asked for a couple of pieces of advice
on this topic, and a few people chimed in.
[SPEAKER_04]: I owe a huge shout out to Mr. Chris
Barkowitz.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys know Chris Barkowitz,
you'll know why this is funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can Google his name if you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: I asked Chris Barkowitz, or I asked on
Facebook, what would be a few things you
[SPEAKER_04]: could do to be a responsible grower and
not get yourself in trouble?
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris's reply was, don't do interviews.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the golden answer right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris is finally free after that
interview, and welcome home, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: You look good in that irie genetics
t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a few responsibilities being a grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure your lights are not visible from
the outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you set up your grow room,
when the sun goes down, turn on all your
[SPEAKER_04]: grow lights, walk outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever, if you're in the basement,
attic, bedroom, walk outside and see if
[SPEAKER_04]: you can see your grow lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can see your grow lights,
fix it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're failing.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: That also means you have a light leak.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That means the lights are getting in
during your flowering cycle, which you're
[SPEAKER_04]: just going to cause a bunch of
hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, your next responsibility.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure the blowers and fans are not
heard by neighbors or people walking past
[SPEAKER_04]: your grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's a spot where you don't think
people will ever walk, the day you build a
[SPEAKER_04]: damn grow, someone's going to walk there.
[SPEAKER_04]: The meter made, the gas guy, some kid
chasing his dog, some cop looking for
[SPEAKER_04]: someone else.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to walk right past that
blower and they're going to go,
[SPEAKER_04]: what is this?
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're going to think, no one's ever
going to walk there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as soon as you put a blower there,
dude, they will.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the way life works.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just be careful plan ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure no one can hear your blowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure no one can see your lights.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's ways to muffle, you know,
insulating the duct, insulating the
[SPEAKER_05]: blower.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can disguise outlets as a dryer
outlet.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can try to put it through the roof.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just move the blower to the other end of
the chain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not so noisy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not right at the window.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those mufflers are a great idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're actually available at a high-grow
window or growing supplies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually a cheaper alternative to the
mufflers and better for your grow is a
[SPEAKER_05]: HEPA filter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those will, you know, if it's sucking in,
those will help, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Over all of my ends where I have,
I've drilled like six inch holes or eight
[SPEAKER_04]: inch holes to have my ends coming in.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get those little square HEPA filters
that are just a sheet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess they're a rectangle and I just
staple those right over it with a staple
[SPEAKER_04]: gun onto the wall.
[SPEAKER_04]: And wherever I do a grow, you want,
yeah, that keeps your bugs out,
[SPEAKER_04]: keeps you all this stuff that you don't
want in your hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: It keeps all that out of there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Filter everything twice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Twice, if you can.
[SPEAKER_04]: People are going, oh my God, how much is
this going to cost?
[SPEAKER_04]: Building a good grow room does cost a
little bit of money.
[SPEAKER_04]: People were asking last night,
they're like, we've got this much budget.
[SPEAKER_04]: Should we buy better this or better this?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of where I think you
should get the best bulbs and ballast you
[SPEAKER_04]: can.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's your first start and then move your
air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then like, if you have to buy in
chunks, I think you buy the lights and
[SPEAKER_04]: then your air moving stuff, like you're
ducting your blowers and then your air
[SPEAKER_04]: conditioner.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you buy your pots and soil and
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: Start with the room and just buy slowly
instead of, but yeah, it's all about
[SPEAKER_04]: choosing where the weakest link is always
going to be the weakest link.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to decide where to pinch your
budget there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get the good bulbs and good ballasts.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's definitely my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's a big issue that we've been
dealing with here in Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_04]: This caused a lot of, most of our new laws
here that are being proposed in Pueblo are
[SPEAKER_04]: because of this issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure nobody can smell your grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: The smell is the most offensive and
revealing part of your grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I said offensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some people that do not love the
smell of sweet, sweet, sticky ganja in the
[SPEAKER_04]: morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a guy here in our city that keeps
complaining to city council that he can
[SPEAKER_04]: smell pot every day when he wakes up
because his neighbors are growing the
[SPEAKER_04]: dank.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, keep that smell down.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you build your grow discreetly and you
don't bring it attention to yourself,
[SPEAKER_04]: your neighbors will never know you've got
to grow in your home.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a security issue too.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just inviting people in,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only thieves, but moochies.
[SPEAKER_04]: You make more friends than you've ever
wanted when people find out you grow weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I get one of those buds?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: What buds?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a dead skunk in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, several years ago I lived in
another house and I had a grow in the
[SPEAKER_04]: basement there and the power went out and
I was mid flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it stinks, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the power guys had to come through
everybody's backyard looking for the
[SPEAKER_04]: problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wasn't at the place, but my
girlfriend was there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the power guy told my girlfriend,
ma'am, I'd go in the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: It smells like you got a skunk in the
backyard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like he could smell my grow completely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she just made a cringing face and went
in the house and told me about it later.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if you can't smell it, people can
smell your grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're around it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You sleep by it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You wake up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're smoking it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're the last person that's going to
smell it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The church lady down the block can smell
it down the street.
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't let anybody smell your grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's step number four to be a good
responsible grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're building a grow room,
do whatever it takes to make sure no kids
[SPEAKER_04]: ever get into your grow space.
[SPEAKER_04]: I stuttered when I said that because I
mean it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure no kids ever get into your grow
space.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's important.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like the biggest black eye you can
put on the cannabis community right now is
[SPEAKER_04]: letting kids get caught with your weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's something you might not think
about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the stuff was kind of obvious,
but here's a good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to create a lot of waste
growing plants in your house.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have plant stems and
stocks.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have root balls.
[SPEAKER_04]: Find a responsible way to dispose of
everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of you guys live out in the rural
areas, burn that shit if you can.
[SPEAKER_04]: Compost it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Compost it if you can.
[SPEAKER_04]: But see, I live in the city and my grow is
in a city facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's all got to be chopped up into
little tiny pieces and put into secured
[SPEAKER_04]: trash bags.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's got to be destroyed on site.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the other guys, you're going to have to
find, what if the trash guy has dumped in
[SPEAKER_04]: your trash and finds all your pot leaves
in Connecticut when you're growing pot?
[SPEAKER_04]: What if he's not cool?
[SPEAKER_04]: What if he is cool?
[SPEAKER_04]: Then he's going to want your weed and he's
going to rob you.
[SPEAKER_04]: If he's not cool, he's calling the cops.
[SPEAKER_04]: So be careful.
[SPEAKER_04]: They might find your trash.
[SPEAKER_04]: They cannot, from Jorge's book that I
read, they cannot start a case based on
[SPEAKER_04]: your trash.
[SPEAKER_04]: That does not justify a search warrant,
but the trash can be used in court as part
[SPEAKER_04]: of the case.
[SPEAKER_05]: So keep an eye on the trash.
[SPEAKER_04]: I lived in Lawrence, Kansas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now that I think about it,
I know people that got busted and had
[SPEAKER_04]: their trash used as evidence in court.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that I think about it, I can't
remember their names, but a couple of kids
[SPEAKER_04]: I worked at a place with
[SPEAKER_04]: and I found a bunch of that tape,
that dark colored tape.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you could tell it was wrapped around
like a, I've seen plenty of pounds of
[SPEAKER_04]: weed, like brick pounds of weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it was wrapped around weed
or some cocaine or something, but it was
[SPEAKER_04]: that kind of tape.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know exactly somebody had a nice
bulk of something in my bowling alley one
[SPEAKER_04]: night.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: You found that in the trash at the bowling
alley.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the trash, in the bathroom,
just sitting on the top.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're telling me that someone at
evidence lockup may have been crooked.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not the evidence tape.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be a lot cooler.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know that like brown tape they wrapped
the kilos with?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a bunch of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So somebody had a kilo of coke or a pound
of weed in the bowling alley, which isn't
[SPEAKER_04]: really surprising now that I'm thinking
about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bowling alleys are kind of sketchy places
that people don't think about.
[SPEAKER_04]: So think about what you guys are going to
do with your trash.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, you got a bunch of shit that
you're going to have to throw away and not
[SPEAKER_04]: look obvious with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got more than two lights,
when you harvest four lights worth of
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff, three lights worth of stuff,
that's a lot of trash to take care of.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you don't know what to do,
if you don't know how to recycle and
[SPEAKER_04]: compost your soil, you've got soil to deal
with too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got perlite in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got old nutrients in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to be careful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's another one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep your yard and house clean and
presentable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't give your neighbors or anyone in the
neighborhood a reason to dislike you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't stand out.
[SPEAKER_04]: If the house is on your block,
get the lawn mowed once a week,
[SPEAKER_04]: go mow the lawn once a week.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they got flowers grown outside and it's
a bunch of yuppies, look like a bunch of
[SPEAKER_04]: yuppies and grow flowers outside,
dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Try to fit in the best you can.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just don't be the neighborhood asshole if
you're going to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Help out.
[SPEAKER_04]: When it snows, shovel the extra house next
door on each side of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just do what you can to kind of be
friendly.
[SPEAKER_04]: A friend of mine, Amanda on Facebook said
she actually just moved into a new house
[SPEAKER_04]: and she's building her grow in there in a
legal state.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can talk about her.
[SPEAKER_04]: She said she walked to her neighbors on
either side and introduced herself and
[SPEAKER_04]: said, hey, my name's Amanda.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the new neighbor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's my phone number.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you ever have any problems,
feel free to call me.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys ever want to hang out,
just let me know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So by making friends and giving them her
number, she's done two things.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they get pissed off at her,
they won't call the cops.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll call her or they'll come over and
be like, hey dude, your grateful dead
[SPEAKER_04]: music's too damn loud.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hippies chill out with the drum
circle in here?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, Amanda.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hope you're listening to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then she'll stop, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also if something's wrong,
they don't have to call 911.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can call her and be like,
your house is glowing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there's a bunch of light coming from
the basement window.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your curtain fell.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's happening?
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't have to get to the cops right
away.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just be a good neighbor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Introduce yourself, make friends,
be social.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Number seven, we've talked about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't burn the place down and make us all
look like assholes.
[SPEAKER_04]: This cannabis revolution is new.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are tons of people who hate the
movement.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fox News hates us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anytime some dipshit burns down a house by
blasting indoors or overpowering his
[SPEAKER_04]: breaker box, it makes the entire movement
look stupid.
[SPEAKER_04]: So please guys, don't be the asshole we
see on Fox News.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said earlier, they're not going to
say this medical marijuana provider had a
[SPEAKER_04]: snafu.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to say this drug lab erupted
in flames.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're going to be on the news and
handcuffs in the back of a cop car looking
[SPEAKER_04]: like a dipshit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please don't be that guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no reason to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Grow equipment is pretty cheap nowadays.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't use some sketchy asshole shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're running a bunch of lights,
get yourself a power box, plug it into the
[SPEAKER_04]: 240 and plug all the lights into that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're pretty much legit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can run like eight lights on that
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nine or 12.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen like 16 light ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, if you know an electrical
upgrades aren't really that expensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're going nuts, you know,
do it the right way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't run extension cords all over the
day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Each extension cord is a fire hazard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Each one.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you need electrical upgrades,
guys, just call.
[SPEAKER_04]: Craig's list is filled with electricians
that advertise that they're MMJ friendly
[SPEAKER_04]: or 420 friendly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get one of those, get one of those guys to
come wire up your shit because when they
[SPEAKER_04]: do it, you'll be so impressed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks so cool to have your stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first time you get a professionally
wired up grow room, you got the wire
[SPEAKER_04]: going, like the little conduit going all
the way across the room with the box every
[SPEAKER_04]: like eight feet or six feet from a plugin.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then like a big, one big breaker box
on the outside of the room that you could
[SPEAKER_04]: shut everything off so that you know,
you can work on shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not get any electricity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, that is so sweet looking.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first time you get that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So have a pro come do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Find them on Craig's list.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you need to, if you're in the Southern
Colorado area, I've got a guy,
[SPEAKER_04]: I got two guys for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if this first guy is busy, we can send
his, his old boss to come help you out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't burn the shit down.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no need.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No reason for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That should be, you know, one of the
number one things when you're setting up a
[SPEAKER_05]: grow room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, I always add a fire extinguisher and
a smoke alarm.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put a smoke detector in the grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put it near the, the exhaust fan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you've got a carbon filter sucking
air out, put it near there because the
[SPEAKER_04]: smoke is going to get sucked toward that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That way put the smoke alarm there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put a fire extinguisher outside of the
damn grow room because you don't want to
[SPEAKER_04]: have to run in there and get the
extinguisher.
[SPEAKER_04]: If that room is on fire, you want to be
able to kick in the door and just start
[SPEAKER_04]: spraying that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: At high grow indoor growing supplies,
you can pick up an item called the flame
[SPEAKER_04]: defender.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't used it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done a lot of research about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That I need those.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those look like the way to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're going to get ourselves set
up with those.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll test them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully we never have to test them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully we never find out how good those
work.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So guys, once you figure out how much herb
you need to produce, that's when you can
[SPEAKER_04]: start designing your grow space.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, sometimes your space dictates
how you build your grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where, that's where the fun kicks
in, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Building a grow is all about adapting to
the space you're provided.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of you guys are going to use a small
closet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of you might use a spare bedroom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of you guys are going to buy a grow
hut and set that up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will do a lot of talking about a grow
hut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe not on this episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're already 35 minutes in, but I will
definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm writing that down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Crow hut.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're very versatile.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people made fun of them at first,
but I have done some breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done some phenose selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done some great growing in just a
grow hut.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're great if you have limited space.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can put it in the corner of your
bedroom and it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen a whole bedroom full of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a quite the little production
area.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, since I'm only allowed a small
plant count here in Pueblo in my house and
[SPEAKER_04]: a spare bedroom, I run two five by five
hydro huts on a flip box, uh, with a 600
[SPEAKER_04]: watt light in each hut.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what happens, I run one ballast,
the ballast plugs into the wall on a
[SPEAKER_04]: timer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it goes ballast and then there's a cord
that goes to the flip box.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the flip box has two cords that
come out and a bulb comes from each one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And every 12 hours side a lights up and
then for 12 hours it stays on and then it
[SPEAKER_04]: shuts off.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other side comes on for 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: So instead of adding electrical upgrades
to that bedroom that I'm just using in the
[SPEAKER_04]: winter as a grow space for the,
it keeps the house warm up here actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just run that, uh, using the flip
box, I can use that room all the time and
[SPEAKER_04]: have it flowering constantly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And not have any downtime in that room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, it's like a, an 11, it's like a 14
by nine room.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those two five by five huts fit
perfectly in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it gives me a little bit of room to
work because I really liked the grow huts.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people talk shit about them and
hate on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my friend that was doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, um, he didn't have the flip box,
but, um, he had two different ballasts.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he was, you know, one was on for 12
hours and it was on for 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just, uh, he just had the extra ballast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't want to go buy another one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like that flip box was the price of
another ballast and everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was like, I'll just do it this way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was, it's kind of a test idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to see if I could do that on a
larger scale because I've designed an 18
[SPEAKER_04]: light room.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's two nine room or two nine light
rooms on a flip box.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and then I actually did some research
and a guy named Eric Bicsa kind of beat me
[SPEAKER_04]: to the punch on this room that I was
trying to build.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a cool room.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a 10 by 10 room with a 10 by five
lung room in the middle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of your equipment is in that
middle room.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you cool off all of the air in the
middle room and one side sleeps.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're producing CO2 in the sleeping
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys plants that are asleep kick off CO2.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can vent that CO2 into your flower
room that's awake, you can use that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, but so yeah, you're just, you got one
air conditioner, one set of ballast,
[SPEAKER_04]: one dehumidifier, and then you're just
moving the air around in both rooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Killer idea guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a huge room.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like multi-thousand dollar room.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some of you guys are going to grow like
in closets and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm saying, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of you guys are going to grow and
grow huts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of you guys might even bust out 16
lights in a basement.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, uh, however you do it,
there will be some obstacles presented by
[SPEAKER_04]: your existing environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you're building a building that's
designed to be a grow space from the
[SPEAKER_04]: beginning, you're going to have to deal
with some type of obstacles.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's part of the fun for me,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like taking a space like a dirty
basement or a funky attic or the back part
[SPEAKER_04]: of the dispensary and making it an
amazing, sufficient grow with the space
[SPEAKER_04]: and power that I've got without having to
do any crazy, dramatic improvements to the
[SPEAKER_04]: place.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of a fun challenge.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't think I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do upgrades after every single run.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes upgrades that slow me down quite
a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've had some downtime for a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard you talking about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's talk about a few things that
every grow will need.
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be more things you're going to
have to add to this depending on your room
[SPEAKER_04]: and your space, but every room is going to
need these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is mostly for just one flowering
room.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to have plants vegging while
your crop flowers, you're going to need a
[SPEAKER_04]: small veg room also.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eventually you're going to want a mother
room and a clone area and a veg area and a
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding area and a place for your male
plants and a place to make pollen.
[SPEAKER_04]: It gets ridiculous when you start doing it
a whole bunch, but eventually you're going
[SPEAKER_04]: to want to add more rooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: My advice is build slowly and plan ahead
with realistic expectations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't start counting your chickens before
the hatch.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got a light and you expect a
pound of weed, start thinking you got
[SPEAKER_04]: three quarters of a pound of weed and
budget for that because you're not going
[SPEAKER_04]: to grow as great as you plan your first
couple of runs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So make your upgrades.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Jesse said, he makes upgrades every
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of plan them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't go too ambitious your first couple
of times.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be realistic about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can fail.
[SPEAKER_04]: Crops fail.
[SPEAKER_04]: Things that kill crops, spider mites,
air conditioner failure.
[SPEAKER_04]: If your air conditioner cuts out in the
middle of a flower cycle and you're at
[SPEAKER_04]: work and it's 90 degrees outside and
you're going to come home and it's going
[SPEAKER_04]: to be 108 degrees in your grow room and
you're going to have crispy buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're already dried and cured for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: That shit happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're running a hydro setup,
if one pump dies while you're at work or
[SPEAKER_04]: while you're asleep, everything can go
crunchy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get me started on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we have a mutual friend that went
to Las Vegas for two days.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was supposed to go to a wedding and
didn't want to go, but he had to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was like a five day vacation
planned.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he went for two days.
[SPEAKER_04]: He flew there and flew back right away and
came home and his pump took a shit while
[SPEAKER_04]: he was gone and his whole four by four
table done.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a double redundancy set up,
you know, two pumps and on a set up at a
[SPEAKER_05]: dispensary and both failed the same
weekend while everyone was at the Canada's
[SPEAKER_05]: Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Goodbye.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two tables worth of weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two whole tables.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: See?
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been trying that for a while too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis, cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just sounds like a better word.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Herb.
[SPEAKER_04]: I call it herb a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a Rasta in me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good herb.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're talking about things that all
grows need.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every grow is going to need electricity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Duh, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you're growing outside,
you need electricity.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to need lights and timers.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll need intake and outtake fans and
you're going to need a water source.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the basics that every grow will
need.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're at 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to try to squeeze as much of
this in as we can, but we might not
[SPEAKER_04]: actually even get to like, might not get
to the build part until another episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I have another episode planned that
is just, I've had news articles set aside.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a couple of things Mike and I
wanted to talk about.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to kind of go between these two
build episodes, I think, but I might put
[SPEAKER_04]: it out as like a midweek episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think after we record here,
Mike's going to come over and bullshit
[SPEAKER_04]: with me again and talk about some things.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the next one will be a news heavy catch
up episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'll try to get Jesse back as
soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk more about building cause
you're going to send me so many questions
[SPEAKER_04]: I can already tell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We love the questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: That means we're doing our job.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we spark your thoughts, that means
we're doing our job.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, LB, you asked me questions and I
appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope I have responded appropriately.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to say your full name because
I haven't gotten your permission,
[SPEAKER_04]: but LB, I appreciate you for listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So lights, everybody needs lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lights are actually the main ingredient to
your grow space.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lights dictate the cycles of the gardens.
[SPEAKER_04]: They tell you if you're in veg or if
you're in flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lights are also the main fuel and energy
provider for your plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lights create photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lights are the main thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the number one nutrient.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put as big of a light as you can in your
space is what I always say.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So no matter how big or small your grow
space is, you will need some sort of air
[SPEAKER_04]: exchange system.
[SPEAKER_04]: Always.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to get rid of that old,
stale, funky air.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't stress how important this is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the problems I see from low budget
grows is a lack of airflow and air
[SPEAKER_04]: exchange.
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving the air around the room is great,
but you need to replace the air in the
[SPEAKER_04]: room also.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you leave a freshly watered crop locked
in a sealed closet with a light above it,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're creating a very humid environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plants are trying to transpire,
but there's too much moisture in the air.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plants can't sweat like they should,
which slows down photosynthesis and stunts
[SPEAKER_04]: growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: It also makes your plants look angry and
sad too.
[SPEAKER_04]: If the plants are left in excessive
humidity for long periods, they will
[SPEAKER_04]: become very susceptible to our good
friend, powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_04]: As your buds grow, your risk of powdery
mildew way increases.
[SPEAKER_04]: The insides of your buds, if you're not
getting some airflow in there and you got
[SPEAKER_04]: too much moisture in the room,
that mold is going to grow right in the
[SPEAKER_04]: middle of your buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So lock yourself in your car one day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just lock yourself in the car in the sun
and just try to sit in there and breathe
[SPEAKER_04]: for the whole day.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it feels like for your plants
when you just stifle them locked up in a
[SPEAKER_04]: tight room.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good way to put it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've stressed the need for air
exchange.
[SPEAKER_04]: Water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Water should be easily accessible.
[SPEAKER_04]: I predict that each thousand watt light
will require about five gallons of water
[SPEAKER_04]: two to three times a week.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this works across the board.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to put 16 three gallon pots under a
light, or I like to put nine five gallon
[SPEAKER_04]: pots, or between four and six,
seven gallon pots underneath a thousand
[SPEAKER_04]: watt light.
[SPEAKER_04]: And either way, I find that that requires
about five gallons of water for each
[SPEAKER_04]: water.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a real good estimate actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad that works out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So keep that in mind that you guys are
going to have to get water to your grow
[SPEAKER_04]: space at least twice a week, unless you
set up a drip system.
[SPEAKER_04]: Late in flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if your room is a little hotter,
you may be watering three or four times a
[SPEAKER_04]: week.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hitting my plants is a little cool
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm hitting them Monday.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hit them with nutrients real heavy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I try to hit them on Thursday or
Friday with just enough water to keep them
[SPEAKER_04]: through Monday.
[SPEAKER_04]: But since they haven't been drinking a
lot, that means that on their next day
[SPEAKER_04]: when they get just water, I'm going to
really water the shit out of them to kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of wash out any excess nutrients that have
built up over time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll start re-feeding the soil
again around day 30.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really pummel them with a lot of sugars
and things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And smaller plants will use water a lot
more often too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, that mic stand is fired after its
performance tonight.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a mic stand that needs Viagra.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll swap it out for that one over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about giving you the shitty mic
stand.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to talk to our sponsors about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys are interested in sponsoring
the iGrowCulture podcast, email me
[SPEAKER_04]: iGrowCulture at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love to hear what you have to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll send you a one sheet.
[SPEAKER_04]: If that's what you're looking for,
I'll let you know what my rates are.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been hitting between 3,000 and 5,000
listeners per episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: 5,000 is our peak.
[SPEAKER_04]: 2,500 is like our low on an episode now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how many people are hearing this
show.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank each and every one of you that
are listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like we've talked about the very
basics of building a room.
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about setting a goal for how
much cannabis we need to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wrote herb right here, but I corrected
myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next step is figuring out if you're
building your room to fit your production
[SPEAKER_04]: needs or if you're building the room to
fit the available space, budget,
[SPEAKER_04]: and electrical limitations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes you can't always throw a 24
lights in your basement because you can't
[SPEAKER_04]: pull that many amps.
[SPEAKER_04]: So find a happy medium that lets you grow
a few crops and then see if this is
[SPEAKER_04]: something that you can dedicate more time
and space and electricity to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then after a couple of crops,
expand your grows, plant them out,
[SPEAKER_04]: but don't expand more quickly than you can
learn.
[SPEAKER_04]: I keep saying that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine this, imagine getting ahead of
yourself will cause you headaches in the
[SPEAKER_04]: future.
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine if you have 24 lights in flower
with six, seven gallon pots under each
[SPEAKER_04]: light, and now you have fungus gnats and
it's your first grow and you're like four
[SPEAKER_04]: weeks into flower and you can't spray.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause if you spray, you're going to put
shit in your buds, but you got to get rid
[SPEAKER_04]: of those fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you got a whole lot of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just spent, if you got 24 lights,
it's like 150 plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: That should be 24 to 30 pounds of weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you do this, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Some guys are going to get 48 pounds of
weed out of these 24 lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're running some OG Kush or Girl's
Got Cookies, you're hoping for those 25
[SPEAKER_04]: pounds out of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now you may have to cut it down four
weeks in.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: What if you got spider mites in there?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm cringing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I'm saying is start small,
dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fail small before you fail so large,
because when you grow, you're going to
[SPEAKER_04]: fail.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mess up at this rate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still kill stuff on accident,
but that's the only way I learn.
[SPEAKER_04]: I encourage a little bit of experiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't experiment on your mom's.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't experiment on your patient's
important crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pick a plant, torture it, see what you can
do to it, but go small.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like experience a few problems before you
try to battle fungus gnats in a 24 light
[SPEAKER_04]: flowering room.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are 47 minutes in.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if we should try to keep
going or if we should save this next part
[SPEAKER_04]: for another episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause we're, we kind of got them on the
edge of their seats right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk about, we'll talk about this
one spot right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, so we're going to talk a little
bit about room size in relation to how
[SPEAKER_04]: many and what type of lights to use.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got about 10 minutes to do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a small closet set up, I would use some
small T5 lights, little fluorescent
[SPEAKER_04]: lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: I personally don't like the coiled CFLs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't feel like they put out enough
light.
[SPEAKER_04]: They weren't great as supplements.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's all you've got and all you power,
it's going to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for the amount of heat that they put
off, I don't think they put off enough
[SPEAKER_04]: light.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: For a closet, I would almost recommend
it's a T5 light.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there are eight bulbs and I think
it's 24 by 24 is the dimensions of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's actually made by
Hydrofarm.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got a small closet, that is the
perfect light in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can't run a lot of electricity,
you can put that in a small fan and leave
[SPEAKER_04]: the closet cracked a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got a grow room, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as you're getting that stale air
out of there and not letting it get too
[SPEAKER_04]: hot, keep those T5 lights right above your
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then every night you got to close that
closet door at the same time and turn off
[SPEAKER_04]: your light to start your flower cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you got to be on the money,
eight o'clock, eight o'clock every day and
[SPEAKER_04]: night.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in a small closet, I think that little
T5 light I'm talking about is perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe a small HID, a high intensity
discharge light, maybe like a 150 in a
[SPEAKER_04]: closet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really like a 250 watt high pressure
sodium light.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really find those to be efficient.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are cool lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great size light.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't take a lot of wattage,
but it does make a little bit of heat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if your closet's a little bigger,
400s are great.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly what I wrote down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say a 400 is kind of the
biggest you really want to go in a closet
[SPEAKER_04]: unless you got like one of those fancy
like Bel Air walk-in closets.
[SPEAKER_04]: But everyone's got a small closet they can
dedicate to a grow space.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're just trying to supply herb
for you and your girlfriend or something,
[SPEAKER_04]: or your patient, just you, the closet is
fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially with the little T5 light.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you could pull some stuff out of a
T5.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that where your first grow was at,
my closet?
[SPEAKER_04]: Technically, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was in a closet, but inside of that
closet, I put a grow hut in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of a large closet.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was more of a closet that was actually
attached to the hot water heater area.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the closet had another door in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I actually took the ducting from my
hot water heater and my heater and used
[SPEAKER_04]: some of the CO2 to my grow room.
[SPEAKER_05]: That can be a little dangerous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't do that if you don't know what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, perfect little closet.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great way to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can grow a little short plants in
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can supply yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: A small corner of a room works.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you need to like tarp off a room or
like if you have a small room that you can
[SPEAKER_04]: just take the corner, you can put a grow
hut in the corner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grow huts are awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said I'm going to do a whole talk about
those.
[SPEAKER_04]: That will be another episode, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're at 50 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: 40 minutes now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've noticed you guys don't listen past
45.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the listeners click out at 45
minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're droning off.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you're not droning on.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I meant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't mean... After a while,
if we listen to the show, I can tell we
[SPEAKER_04]: run out of energy about an hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, oh, my throat's done.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the listeners are getting drowsy.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I meant to say.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't blame you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you got that small corner, small space.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can put a T5 all the way up to like a
600 watt light in like a six by six space
[SPEAKER_04]: if you can vent it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk in the next episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse is actually like a carpenter,
craftsman, house builder, manly man.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's going to talk about framing up a
space and stuff in the next episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to try to get this part done
quickly here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grow huts.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will talk a lot about them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can put a grow hut in the corner of
any room.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can put multiple grow huts in a
basement.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can put one grow hut in every room if
you've got limited power.
[SPEAKER_04]: Find out where each room is on each
breaker.
[SPEAKER_04]: And put one grow hut on each breaker.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can grow plenty of cannabis in one
house or one location.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds like my kind of place.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I've been to houses like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then of course, there's the whole
dedicated bedroom.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got a nice bedroom that nobody
needs, if you're a single guy and your
[SPEAKER_04]: roommate sucks, kick him out and build a
grow room.
[SPEAKER_04]: He won't eat your food.
[SPEAKER_04]: He won't bring over ugly chicks.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got a grow room in there now that's
going to produce dank cannabis and it will
[SPEAKER_04]: pay for itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something I should write down to talk
about is the cost of running the grow room
[SPEAKER_04]: because that's just on my mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had more paper here and I don't know
where the note I wrote earlier went.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll write that right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It gets expensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big grow rooms, big facilities and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Astronomical electricity bills.
[SPEAKER_04]: But imagine if you and I were roommates
and you kicked me out and built a grow
[SPEAKER_04]: room in my space, it would definitely pay
for itself in the long run.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, easily.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it wouldn't eat your freaking Ben &
Jerry's.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would get you high as crap in the end.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a whole room, you can put multiple,
depending on the size of your room,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you've got... So I say like every six
by six, four by four, four by four to six
[SPEAKER_04]: by six space, you should put about a
thousand watt light if you can vent it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got a room that's like 10 by 10,
I think you should put 4,000 watt lights
[SPEAKER_04]: in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're getting bigger and bigger,
it kind of depends on your wattage and
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But about every five by five square should
be a thousand watt light if you can vent
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I try to leave... People hate wattage.
[SPEAKER_04]: They hate walkways.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of growers say that walkways are
expensive and a waste of space.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like giving myself a walkway so I can
get to every single plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the plants like the space to
breathe.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't like being crowded in on the bus
with everybody touching you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your plants don't like that shit either.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give them some room to breathe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And keeping the leaves off of each other
will prevent powdery mildew and places for
[SPEAKER_04]: bugs to jump around.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you've got a whole room,
put a 1000 watt light every five by five
[SPEAKER_04]: space up to the limit that your
electricity will allow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that you can cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a random recommendation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's about 3000 BTUs of cooling
for every single thousand watt light is
[SPEAKER_04]: what I think you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: 2,500 to 3000.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So keep that in mind when you're... And
you have to power that air conditioner
[SPEAKER_04]: also.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in your big room here, if you've got...
And your two 30 amp breakers, you're going
[SPEAKER_04]: to be able to run one, maybe two lights
and an air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: On a 30 amp breaker.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're going to need an electrician to
come wire up your big room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not going to be able to get the air
conditioner on that most likely.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got a big garage or a basement,
you need to have the electrician come and
[SPEAKER_04]: wire you up with 240 in the whole
basement.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you need to have a mini split put
in the basement and hang like 24 lights
[SPEAKER_04]: down there in your basement.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you got to have an HVAC guy come set
that up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, they're fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That mini split is going to be fun to put
in.
[SPEAKER_04]: But man, you can keep it so cool once you
get it there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the next step up from there,
after you have your basement or your big
[SPEAKER_04]: garage with multiple thousands,
anything more than nine lights,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think becomes like kind of extensive for
a home grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah, if you got like 10 lights in a
house, you're kind of pushing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then you move on to like the
commercial scale warehouses where you've
[SPEAKER_04]: got multiple rooms with multiple thousand
watt lights or one giant room with a
[SPEAKER_04]: hundred lights in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of prefer more separated rooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to breed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if something goes wrong in one room,
you don't have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everywhere is a little more containable.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my main point is plan the room before
you start building.
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about how many lights you want to
run.
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about how much cannabis you want to
produce.
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about your electrical limitations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about your budget.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to cost you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we said about a hundred bucks a month
to run a light and its accessories.
[SPEAKER_04]: So keep that in mind until harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not going to have, you're going to
have to figure out how to pay for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once harvest comes, then you obviously
have a way to pay for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to be at an hour real quick
here, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a good way to make this a two-part
episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: The part we're going to come up with next
is actually the basic steps to building
[SPEAKER_04]: the room and some guidance on building a
room and things to look for.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to cut this episode off right
here and we'll make that part two.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, thanks for coming and doing another
great episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just crushed this one, I feel like.
[SPEAKER_04]: We kind of droned on for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I've been talking for an hour
straight.

[SPEAKER_04]: Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for

[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, what's going on, Podcast World?
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to episode number 38 of the
iGroculture Podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for joining me for another episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm coming to you today, November 1st,
the day after Halloween, and I am proud to
[SPEAKER_04]: report that nobody gave any
trick-or-treaters cannabis-infused candy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm proud of you guys and I want to say
thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a little bit of a news article
here that I want to read if I can get it
[SPEAKER_04]: to pop up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a news article here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is from the Denver Associated Press.
[SPEAKER_04]: The headline is, The article says,
Police in Colorado have warned parents to
[SPEAKER_04]: look out for pot-laced Halloween candy,
but parents don't seem too worried.
[SPEAKER_04]: A Denver-based testing company offered
1,000 free kits to parents wanting to
[SPEAKER_04]: screen their trick-or-treaters haul for
marijuana psychoactive chemical.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, only 45 parents took CB
Scientific up on the offer as of Friday.
[SPEAKER_04]: There have been no reported cases of
people slipping marijuana into
[SPEAKER_04]: unsuspecting trick-or-treaters in Colorado
or in any other state.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the popularity of pot candies in the
new retail market in Colorado prompted
[SPEAKER_04]: warnings this fall from police in Denver,
Fort Collins, and Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_04]: As of Halloween morning, Denver police and
the Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Center
[SPEAKER_04]: reported no calls about marijuana in
Halloween candy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to jump in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Marijuana does not have ingredients.
[SPEAKER_04]: Marijuana is a plant, so you don't need
ingredients to mix it together and make a
[SPEAKER_04]: plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: But nice try.
[SPEAKER_04]: Short said the free kits were available to
parents anywhere, but that nearly all the
[SPEAKER_04]: requests came from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: We stepped in to tell parents,
don't be spooked.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not trying to jump on some
fear-mongering bandwagon, Short said.
[SPEAKER_04]: Since January, Children's Hospital
Colorado has reported nine admissions for
[SPEAKER_04]: children accidentally consuming edible
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's unclear whether those cases were from
homemade treats or edible
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana-purchased products sold at
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado police have said they're just
trying to boost awareness because of a
[SPEAKER_04]: wider availability of pot candies.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Larimer County Sheriff's Department,
for example, said in its warning that
[SPEAKER_04]: vigilance is necessary because marijuana
candies don't necessarily appear unusual.
[SPEAKER_04]: THC-infused edibles are often designed to
look very similar to popular-name brand
[SPEAKER_04]: treats, the office warned.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Washington State,
[SPEAKER_04]: the only other state with legal
recreational pot sales, authorities have
[SPEAKER_04]: been more circumspect.
[SPEAKER_04]: A sheriff's detective in Pierce County,
Washington wrote a newspaper column saying
[SPEAKER_04]: pot showing up in trick-or-treat bags is
an urban myth.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's too expensive, hard to get,
and users of these products are pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: laid back and not generally terrifying in
nature, the detective said.
[SPEAKER_04]: Detective Ed Troyer wrote Monday in the
Tacoma Weekly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, I think Ed's got the right
idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's too expensive, first of all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Edibles at a dispensary are kind of
expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people that are buying and using
cannabis, we're not mean, most of us are
[SPEAKER_04]: not mean-spirited people.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't want to play tricks on people.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't want to give people cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think most of us have realized that
if we do that, we are fighting down our
[SPEAKER_04]: own movement.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my point here is that I'm glad nobody
gave anybody any cannabis-infused candies
[SPEAKER_04]: over Halloween.
[SPEAKER_04]: My other point is that that's a lot of
hype and a lot of fear.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you guys are believing that,
relax a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not as big of a fear as we thought it
was.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope everybody had a happy and safe
Halloween.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am going to continue with this next news
article, and then we'll do a couple of
[SPEAKER_04]: ads.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one's kind of related.
[SPEAKER_04]: A part of that article that I just read
said that a lot of edibles are designed to
[SPEAKER_04]: look like popular candies, but no more.
[SPEAKER_04]: This article comes from the Denver Post,
and it is written by David Magoya.
[SPEAKER_04]: The headline says, The article says,
The small Colorado Springs-based producer
[SPEAKER_04]: of marijuana edibles sued in June by candy
giant The Hershey Company for allegedly
[SPEAKER_04]: breaching a number of design and name
patents quietly settled the dispute.
[SPEAKER_04]: In a settlement penned in late September,
Tinkerbell agreed to recall and destroy
[SPEAKER_04]: all edibles it sold that looked like the
famed chocolate company's products or with
[SPEAKER_04]: names that played on their brands.
[SPEAKER_04]: Though the edibles company said it had
long ago stopped making products that
[SPEAKER_04]: appeared like those products by Hershey,
including well-known names such as
[SPEAKER_04]: Reese's, Almond Joy's, and Heath,
long before the federal lawsuit was filed
[SPEAKER_04]: in June in U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: District Court in Denver, the settlement
makes sure it won't happen again.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these guys were making edibles,
and some of them were delicious,
[SPEAKER_04]: dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: They make a Reefer's peanut butter bar
that looks just like the Reese's peanut
[SPEAKER_04]: butter bar, but it says Reefer's on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The packaging was the same color as the
Reese's peanut butter cups.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked very similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I could see why Hershey's kind of got
pissed at this.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Heath was, I forgot what they called
the Heath bar, but these candy bars looked
[SPEAKER_04]: just like the original candy bar,
and that could cause a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could see that.
[SPEAKER_04]: If your kid saw that sitting on the
counter, which that shit should not be
[SPEAKER_04]: sitting out for a kid to get, but if he
saw that Reefer's bar sitting up there,
[SPEAKER_04]: that kid would probably eat it,
and that kid would be wrecked,
[SPEAKER_04]: and you'd be a shitty parent, and then
you'd be putting another mark of one of
[SPEAKER_04]: those kids in the hospital for cannabis,
and you'd make the whole movement look
[SPEAKER_04]: bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the settlement also requires Tinkerbell
not to use the product names Hashi's,
[SPEAKER_04]: Ganja Joy, Hash Heath, Hash Eats,
Thingamajiggy, or and Reefer's,
[SPEAKER_04]: nor to use the name Reefer for any candies
that contain either peanut butter or its
[SPEAKER_04]: flavorings.
[SPEAKER_04]: The company also agreed not to make
packages with brown, yellow, and orange
[SPEAKER_04]: colors, which are those used by Reese's
brand, according to a copy of the
[SPEAKER_04]: statement.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now they can't even use any of the
colors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hershey pretty much cock-blocked these
guys pretty well from doing anything like
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hershey's had said Tinkerbell's products
harmed their brand name and could be
[SPEAKER_04]: confused for regular candy by children,
which is kind of what I was saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tinkerbell neither admitted nor denied any
allegations in the lawsuit as part of the
[SPEAKER_04]: settlement.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not going to be able to get your
Ganja Joy or your Reefer's anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those were super popular in California.
[SPEAKER_04]: It took them a little bit to get their way
out here to Colorado, but we are not going
[SPEAKER_04]: to see that anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, I feel like I'm talking really fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm fired up for this podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had a good day.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a super nice day outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a big package in the mail from our
friends at Sweet Leaf Farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to give them a big shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go check out Sweet Leaf Farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to take a dab, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully I'll slow down and calm down
just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So take a dab with me, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to dab some Scotso G and Senzo G
mix grown by a garden of Wheaton and also
[SPEAKER_04]: extracted by Garden of Wheaton.
[SPEAKER_04]: This stuff is super delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's what won the secret cup regionals in
Denver.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is the shatter version and not
the live resin version.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's take a dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a big fat chunky dab here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to hit the Hitman phase two cake
with a highly educated.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the infinity nail with an e-nail
attachment on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's take a dab together, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's how you take a quarter gram dab
on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a little bit of a cough there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I turned on the cough in your ear.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where were we?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know where we were.

[SPEAKER_04]: You guys want to do another article?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's read another news article.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one sucks, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw this in Denver.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a real popular topic a few days
ago here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody was talking about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, this is from The Cannabis is
where I'm reading it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, where was it originally?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is from Jesse Paul and Noel Phillips
and John Engel of the Denver Post.
[SPEAKER_04]: The headline is, Denver police and feds
conduct large scale raids on marijuana
[SPEAKER_04]: grow sites.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get into this article.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll talk about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Denver police officers, some in hazmat
suits, raided multiple marijuana growing
[SPEAKER_04]: operations Tuesday, part of an
investigation into illegal marijuana sales
[SPEAKER_04]: in Minnesota, a federal law enforcement
official said.
[SPEAKER_04]: The federal official said as much as $1
million was found in large bags during the
[SPEAKER_04]: searches.
[SPEAKER_04]: The official who was not authorized to
disclose information about the case and
[SPEAKER_04]: spoke to the Associated Press on the
condition of anonymity.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really chopped that word, anonymity.
[SPEAKER_04]: He spoke anonymously.
[SPEAKER_04]: Believe people involved came to Colorado
from Minnesota where marijuana is illegal
[SPEAKER_04]: outside of a restrictive medical marijuana
program.
[SPEAKER_04]: Officially, authorities released little
information about the case.
[SPEAKER_04]: On Twitter, Denver police wrote that the
investigation involved illegal drug
[SPEAKER_04]: activity.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a spokesman for the department later
said he did not know if the operations
[SPEAKER_04]: rated were licensed marijuana businesses
or if detectives believed they were
[SPEAKER_04]: exclusively illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Denver police did not announce any arrests
connected to the raids.
[SPEAKER_04]: The spokeswoman for the state marijuana
enforcement division, which regulates
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis businesses, refused to comment on
whether the division was involved in the
[SPEAKER_04]: investigation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Likewise, James Goath, group supervisor of
the drug enforcement administration's
[SPEAKER_04]: special support unit in Denver,
offered little comment.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very large and successful
investigation, Goath said.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have one rated site on North Bryant
Street near West 6th Avenue.
[SPEAKER_04]: A Denver police officer was seen entering
a building in a blue hazmat suit.
[SPEAKER_04]: The officer, his suit reeking of
marijuana, said several search warrants
[SPEAKER_04]: were being executed around the city.
[SPEAKER_04]: The rated building on North Bryant Street
is in an industrial area popular with
[SPEAKER_04]: state legal commercial marijuana growers
and increasingly illegal growers trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: hide among them.
[SPEAKER_04]: The rated address was once home to the
grow operation for a medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_04]: products business.
[SPEAKER_04]: The state records show, but it is unclear
whether the small business is still there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis industry insiders said they
believe the address is now occupied by
[SPEAKER_04]: people claiming to be medical marijuana
caregivers, smaller scale providers that
[SPEAKER_04]: operate with less scrutiny.
[SPEAKER_04]: At neighboring cannabis business,
employees were bewildered by the flurry of
[SPEAKER_04]: police activity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nate Perini, who works at Edible's
manufacturer, Edipure, which is next door
[SPEAKER_04]: to the rated operation on North Bryant
Street, said cops already were there when
[SPEAKER_04]: she got to work around 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're getting rated, she said.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I've seen that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen, oh man, I've seen somebody
about to get rated, not somebody I knew,
[SPEAKER_04]: but there was a house in my neighborhood a
few weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were just vehicles like a block
away, and then you could see one car
[SPEAKER_04]: driving right towards the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, yeah, that shit's going down.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're about to get raided.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's such a weird feeling.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, a police car was parked in front
of the shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And another was parked in the alley behind
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Police tape had been strung around the
perimeter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tuesday's raids came 11 months after local
and federal authorities raided several
[SPEAKER_04]: large marijuana businesses.
[SPEAKER_04]: The largest raids on Colorado pop
businesses, excuse me, since medical
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana became legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Four people connected to the businesses
raided then have been charged with federal
[SPEAKER_04]: crimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And prosecutors have also moved to seize
businesses, have moved to seize the
[SPEAKER_04]: business's assets.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't, from what I have read and seen
recently and what's going on on Facebook,
[SPEAKER_04]: these facilities were not legal medical
marijuana, MED registered facilities.
[SPEAKER_04]: These were caregivers who have kind of
vague rules, but they were probably out of
[SPEAKER_04]: their plant count.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they had that much money on them,
they were doing something that they
[SPEAKER_04]: shouldn't have been doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: A friend of mine on Facebook said that he
saw at least 100 lights stacked up outside
[SPEAKER_04]: of one of these facilities.
[SPEAKER_04]: And imagine being the guys that work at
Edipure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the warehouse right here got raided and
the one right next to it did not.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the one on the other side of it did
not.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everyone's in there growing herb.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you see all these federal agents in
hazmat suits pull up and just start taking
[SPEAKER_04]: shit apart.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they come in with guns blazing,
I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man, imagine having the legal business
next door and you didn't get raided and
[SPEAKER_04]: you're just sitting there, shit in your
pants, waiting for them to come into your
[SPEAKER_04]: spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, what do I do?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do I do?
[SPEAKER_04]: Eventually you're like, just come in
already because you're so freaked out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't know what you're waiting for
anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_04]: But from what I've seen, these places were
not legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this wasn't the feds taking down
medical marijuana facilities.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was actual raids on illegal grows.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that sounds weird being in
Colorado, but there are a lot of these
[SPEAKER_04]: large scale illegal grows going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet they'll keep taking them down too.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I've got another article.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one is, this one I found on,
where did I find this?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is from Toke of the Town,
guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I look at the cannabis, the Toke of the
Town.
[SPEAKER_04]: I look at a lot of websites to find my
cannabis news.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, you have to type in the
word marijuana to find good cannabis news.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to change that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a reminder.
[SPEAKER_04]: Marijuana is a racist word.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was created with racism.
[SPEAKER_04]: It supports a racist connotation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to stop saying marijuana
and let's all say cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis is the revolutionary term.
[SPEAKER_04]: The people before us, the older folks are
afraid of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not as afraid of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've kind of, it's all about the words.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you say the right words, you can
convince people just about anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's start saying cannabis and not
saying marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: The headline of this article, Georgia drug
agents bust man with okra and believe it
[SPEAKER_04]: is marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is kind of an old story.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of you guys might've heard about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's from Mike Adams.
[SPEAKER_04]: The article says, oh, this is really long.
[SPEAKER_04]: We might summarize some of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Americans are no longer safe to cultivate
common garden vegetables without risking
[SPEAKER_04]: the violent wrath of the drug war.
[SPEAKER_04]: No other citizen understands this lunacy
quite like Georgia resident, Dwayne Perry,
[SPEAKER_04]: who told reporters that he was raided by
drug agents earlier last week after an
[SPEAKER_04]: aerial surveillance unit mistook his Oprah
crop for marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It appears as though Georgia law
enforcement has not had enough experience
[SPEAKER_04]: taking down marijuana girl operations to
distinguish the difference between okra
[SPEAKER_04]: and the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, there is a picture of an okra plant
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does not look at all like pot to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got big round leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: The leaves are not serrated.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have the fingery leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't look like a hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't look like weed at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Train these guys a little more.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to summarize this article.
[SPEAKER_04]: Reports indicate that a drug task force
was conducting a marijuana suppression
[SPEAKER_04]: mission when officers spotted Perry's okra
plants and immediately thought he was
[SPEAKER_04]: growing weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okra plants, incidentally, consist of five
fat leaves while the cannabis plant has
[SPEAKER_04]: very distinguishable foliage.
[SPEAKER_04]: They spelled foliage wrong here.
[SPEAKER_04]: They put F-O-I-O-L-I-A-G.
[SPEAKER_04]: Messed my brain all up.
[SPEAKER_04]: In other words, the two plants look
absolutely nothing alike.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, that did not stop officers
with Georgia State Patrol from swooping in
[SPEAKER_04]: on Perry's residence.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dressed to kill is what it says here.
[SPEAKER_04]: In an attempt to destroy the suspected
marijuana growing in his backyard,
[SPEAKER_04]: they were strapped to the gills,
said Perry, explaining to reporters how
[SPEAKER_04]: the officers seemed prepared to shoot him
dead on the spot over a case of mistake in
[SPEAKER_04]: identity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: These cops went in and raided this guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine when you get raided, it's
traumatic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been involved in a couple of raids,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_04]: Knock on wood.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm never in one of those again.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cops come in.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're coming into your home.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can have an AK-47.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could have a bomb.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could have dogs.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could be crazy as shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're coming in.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are prepared for whatever you're
doing in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's scary.
[SPEAKER_04]: They put you on the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: They cuff you.
[SPEAKER_04]: They put a gun to your head.
[SPEAKER_04]: They talk shit to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're doing some kind of crime or in a
house where there's some shit going on,
[SPEAKER_04]: you might expect that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You might be the type of person that's
prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You may have had police interaction and
you know how to handle yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: This dude is a okra grower in Georgia.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty sure he's not experienced with
the SWAT team and the state patrol.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he probably shit his pants when they
came in, probably traumatized him,
[SPEAKER_04]: probably traumatized his family.
[SPEAKER_04]: If there are any kids there, they're
scared shitless of the cops now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's get a little more.
[SPEAKER_04]: I skipped a couple of little short
paragraphs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Although Perry is grateful that a
trigger-happy cop did not riddle him full
[SPEAKER_04]: of holes during the raid, he says there is
no excuse for this level of domestic
[SPEAKER_04]: warfare over a plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Several officers did apologize after
further investigating the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that simply isn't good enough,
says Perry, because the situation could
[SPEAKER_04]: have potentially gotten him killed or
seriously injured.
[SPEAKER_04]: The more I thought about it, what could
have happened, he said, anything could
[SPEAKER_04]: have happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to wrap up that article.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job, Georgia police.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet that made you feel good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet that was a good way to spend your
money.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet you scared the shit out of this old
retired guy for no reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of making friends, the cops keep
making more enemies by doing shit like
[SPEAKER_04]: this.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you put down your guns and quit trying
to be soldiers and just be friends and
[SPEAKER_04]: police the community like we designed the
police for, you'd have a lot more damn
[SPEAKER_04]: friends, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when shit goes wrong,
the cops would have somebody to talk to.
[SPEAKER_04]: They wouldn't have to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when shit goes wrong now,
everybody disappears.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody wants to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody wants to talk to the cops because
the cops are the bad guy now.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're the good guy still, we'd want to
talk to you because we know you'd help us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we don't feel like you're going to
help us.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like you're going to kick my ass
just for pulling me over and it sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shouldn't be scared to pull over when the
cops are pulling me over.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're the guys I should trust.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I'm ranting.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a ridiculous article.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw this unfold on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was highly entertaining.
[SPEAKER_04]: This story is a little bit old,
but it's well worth talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't done any news on the show for a
while.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been packing up such great shows.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a funny article.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one is by William Breeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: The article is headlined, idiot allegedly
rips off pot grow, leaves cell phone
[SPEAKER_04]: behind.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a lot of fun with this one,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy named Chris Mathers from
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just read the story.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris Mathers is apparently a thief,
but not a good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know this because the junkie scumbag
left his smartphone behind earlier this
[SPEAKER_04]: week while allegedly ripping off a
Colorado grower's outdoor garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of several, he's allegedly
burglarized.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, thanks to social media, he's got the
attention of local police.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, this mastermind, Mathers,
left his phone unlocked, which allowed the
[SPEAKER_04]: victim to pull up more than enough
information on the scumbag to track him
[SPEAKER_04]: down and eventually get the cops involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: Details are hazy, mostly to keep the
grower's identity somewhat discreet.
[SPEAKER_04]: But after getting over the initial horror
of seeing their harvest, still weeks from
[SPEAKER_04]: being finished, gone, the owners of the
grow were no doubt elated to find some
[SPEAKER_04]: rather concrete evidence leaking Mathers
to their grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: No word on how Mathers would even know
about the grow, it says in parentheses.
[SPEAKER_04]: After figuring out that the guy left his
phone, his cell phone open for anyone to
[SPEAKER_04]: use, the grower handed things over to the
social media.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a post from one of the grower's
friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, My friend's outdoor was ripped
last night.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the rippers dropped his phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna post his profile below and his
buddy that was involved, found out through
[SPEAKER_04]: reading messages.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please hit me up if you know them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And quickly it escalated.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually saw these posts on Facebook and
it was real, it was like, it's like
[SPEAKER_04]: watching a real soap opera or a reality
show happen on Facebook all day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it says, the victim pulled photos of a
passed out Mathers, his address,
[SPEAKER_04]: phone number, and even a list of other
grow-ups he had allegedly ripped off.
[SPEAKER_04]: While the growers no doubt had the
inclination to go beat his head in,
[SPEAKER_04]: they wisely called the cops.
[SPEAKER_04]: After all, pot is a legal thing to grow in
this state and this is outright theft.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was a lot of talk on Facebook
about people just going and whipping this
[SPEAKER_04]: guy's ass because we had his home phone
number, we had his address, we knew all of
[SPEAKER_04]: his friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was in deep shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like this article says, it's legal to
have cannabis in this state.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they called the cops and I'm pretty
sure this guy was arrested for this,
[SPEAKER_04]: but let's read the article.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, for his part, Mathers sounds like
he's near rock bottom.
[SPEAKER_04]: The grower was able to pull up text
message conversations about Mathers
[SPEAKER_04]: suboxone habit, stuff he used to get off
heroin or oxys, as well as other pill
[SPEAKER_04]: popping adventures.
[SPEAKER_04]: That, and he normally smokes dirt weed,
apparently.
[SPEAKER_04]: The grower found photos of the brick
bullshit he sells for 15 ounce donations
[SPEAKER_04]: on Mathers Facebook account.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys should see this, this guy was
selling some doo-doo weed, it's brick,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's nasty.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks, ugh.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are not, it looks like little piles
of cow shit or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does not look smokable to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this guy gets, he goes and steals
somebody's crop, dude, and he drops his
[SPEAKER_04]: cell phone behind.
[SPEAKER_04]: People had a lot of fun with him on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_04]: We taunted him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Allegedly people taunted him and a lot of
his friends all day long until he took
[SPEAKER_04]: down his entire Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the end, he did end up getting
arrested for stealing this crop,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is justice and hilarious justice,
if you ask me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's read another ad because I've got one
more ad that I've got to read for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: This podcast is brought to you in part by
our good friends at treethugger.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: Treethugger.com, live music, lifestyle
magazine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check out treethugger.com for concert and
festival news and reviews.
[SPEAKER_04]: www.treethugger.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not going to rant too long on this one,
but man, how about that Halloween fish
[SPEAKER_04]: show?
[SPEAKER_04]: Has anybody paid any attention to that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been a fish kid for years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing like a good fish show and that
Halloween show was kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: How long have we been going?
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I've been ranting for at least
20 minutes here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that, 25 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got another news article for you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one is really silly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to read this twice because I didn't
understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I took a couple of dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, speaking of dabs, let's take a dab
together.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you guys want to dab this time?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got some Sour Diesel Nug Run.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to take a dab of that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hit some Sour D.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get it going.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to hit it on my blue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Highly educated carb cap and we're going
to dab out of the phase two with the
[SPEAKER_04]: Infinity Nail hooked up to the E-Nail.
[SPEAKER_04]: E-Nail, you guys might not know what the
E-Nail is.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're dabbing, you got a titanium
nail and usually you'll heat that with a
[SPEAKER_04]: torch, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Heat it up for about, until it's warm.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know about how warm I want it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can almost touch the damn thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it so low temp, but if you don't
want to use a torch all the time,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can buy an E-Nail and you plug the
E-Nail into the wall.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a little box.
[SPEAKER_04]: You set the temperature on the box and
it's got a cord that goes to the nail and
[SPEAKER_04]: the nail's got a little coil wrapped
around it and it keeps your nail hot
[SPEAKER_04]: constantly.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't ever have to hear the torch on
the podcast and you don't have to waste
[SPEAKER_04]: time with the torch.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can just reach up and take a dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Join me guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dab with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Five, four, three.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Sour Diesel Nug Run.
[SPEAKER_04]: That stuff tastes delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man, makes my head spin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now let's read this crazy article.
[SPEAKER_04]: This article is once again by our good
friend, William Breeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I found this article on the toke of the
town.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to stay with me
because this one is kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to drink before I go.
[SPEAKER_04]: That dab is kicking my butt.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: This article headline says, and you're
going to have to pay attention,
[SPEAKER_04]: Wyoming governor candidate wants to shoot
wolves because Coloradans smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to say that again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wyoming governor candidate wants to shoot
wolves because Coloradans smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: The article says, Don Willis wants to kill
wolves.
[SPEAKER_04]: He also wants to be governor, but right
now he's all about killing him some
[SPEAKER_04]: wolves.
[SPEAKER_04]: So much so that he's made it part of his
campaign strategy.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, Wyoming has permitted wolf hunts in
the past, but this year a federal judge
[SPEAKER_04]: put the animals, a key component to the
water ecosystem on a protected list.
[SPEAKER_04]: That pisses off Willis, who has previously
noted just wants wolves to die.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now Willis is saying that the state should
allow the hunt despite federal protection
[SPEAKER_04]: because Colorado has legal weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: The wolf tags have been issued and hunters
had already made plans to start their
[SPEAKER_04]: hunts, he said.
[SPEAKER_04]: The disruption to hunters, outfitters and
the cost to Wyoming game and fish to
[SPEAKER_04]: refund hunting permits caused by a single
black robe judge who sits in Washington DC
[SPEAKER_04]: and has probably never been in Wyoming is
outrageous and should be defied by
[SPEAKER_04]: Wyoming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, apparently you live in, you have to
live in Wyoming to actually care about
[SPEAKER_04]: Wyoming's wolf population.
[SPEAKER_04]: Willis is now calling on hunters to go
ahead and disobey the federal order.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado did just that in the legalization
of pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a federal crime to commercially grow
pot and the state of Colorado defied the
[SPEAKER_04]: federal laws and it all worked out fine,
he told the Billings Gazette, while
[SPEAKER_04]: carefully pointing out that he doesn't
think people should break federal law to
[SPEAKER_04]: use cannabis, nor was he endorsing
cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_04]: He also taunted the US Fish and Wildlife
Service saying he doubted they would
[SPEAKER_04]: enforce the judge's ruling because they
normally side with Wyoming on such
[SPEAKER_04]: matters.
[SPEAKER_04]: Current Wyoming governor Matt Meade agreed
that the hunt should go on but stopped
[SPEAKER_04]: short of advocating people disobey the
federal protections on animals,
[SPEAKER_04]: which are purely shot for trophy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they just shoot wolves for trophy?
[SPEAKER_04]: Wyoming has successfully negotiated
against federal overreach and when
[SPEAKER_04]: necessary they have gone to court,
he said in a release.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not advocate taking an extreme stand
doomed to failure, which undermines
[SPEAKER_04]: Wyoming's interests instead of moving
forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: The article goes on to say that they are
going to pretty much monitor the amount of
[SPEAKER_04]: wolves and then they will reconsider
lifting the ban on wolf hunting.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think this is funny that the
governor is like, hey man, they're smoking
[SPEAKER_04]: pot in Colorado and the feds ain't doing
shit, so let's shoot our wolves in
[SPEAKER_04]: Wyoming.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet the feds won't do shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious to see how that turns out.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's coming up, so I might pay attention
to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chances are I will forget all about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing I won't forget is a big shout
out to our friends at Hygro Indoor Growing
[SPEAKER_04]: Supplies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies has two
locations to serve Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check out the Big Denver Store at 6271
Beach Street or check out the Pueblo
[SPEAKER_04]: location at 618 East 4th Street in Pueblo,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure you check out Hygro Indoor
Growing Supplies for competitive pricing
[SPEAKER_04]: and a great selection of indoor growing
supplies.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right guys, I have one more news
article and then we're going to start
[SPEAKER_04]: wrapping up the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do plan to have Jesse back over in a
couple of days and we're going to talk
[SPEAKER_04]: more about building your grow room.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a couple of cool things lined up
for you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have an episode about growing in
tents or hydro huts.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of great stuff coming up,
so look forward to those episodes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got one more news article.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me get to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says Colorado congressman urges Oregon
to follow his state's excellent example on
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you guys in Oregon, the time to vote is
coming up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please go vote.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're in Oregon, register to vote.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go vote.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't bitch and complain if you don't
vote.
[SPEAKER_04]: The article says this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jared Paulus said in an op-ed Friday that
marijuana legalization is sound policy and
[SPEAKER_04]: he urged Oregonians to follow in
Colorado's footsteps and vote yes on
[SPEAKER_04]: recreational marijuana in next week's
election.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado is approaching the first
anniversary of legally regulated
[SPEAKER_04]: recreational marijuana for adults,
Paulus wrote in the Bend Bulletin.
[SPEAKER_04]: The implementation of our new laws has
gone smoothly overall, providing an
[SPEAKER_04]: excellent example for other states to
follow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our success has made it clear that when
marijuana is regulated like alcohol,
[SPEAKER_04]: it can decrease crime, help fund schools
and drug education programs, and keep
[SPEAKER_04]: money out of the hands of criminals and
cartels.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with most of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oregon voters are considering measure 91,
which would allow adults to possess up to
[SPEAKER_04]: eight ounces of marijuana at home and up
to one ounce in public.
[SPEAKER_04]: Taxes on marijuana sales would fund
schools, law enforcement, and drug
[SPEAKER_04]: prevention and education programs.
[SPEAKER_04]: While the Oregon Liquor Control Commission
would regulate and monitor the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oregon will soon decide whether to join
Colorado and Washington in regulating
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana like alcohol, wrote Paulus,
who previously sponsored legislation that
[SPEAKER_04]: would do just that at the federal level.
[SPEAKER_04]: More than ever, I believe it's time to
change course on decades of failed
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana prohibition and demonstrate
viable, effective alternatives to address
[SPEAKER_04]: the realities of marijuana today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado voters legalized recreational
marijuana in 2012 with the first sales
[SPEAKER_04]: beginning on New Year's Day, 2014.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, I don't know if I've mentioned this
on the show before.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure I haven't, being a smart ass.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was the first guy to buy recreational
cannabis at the Greener Side Dispensary in
[SPEAKER_04]: Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got there at like 5, 46 o'clock in the
morning and sat in line and bought weed
[SPEAKER_04]: first at one of my good friends
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of made me proud.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, while the rollout of the new
recreational marijuana regulatory regime
[SPEAKER_04]: has not been perfect, it has largely been
deemed a success.
[SPEAKER_04]: Voters supported the end of marijuana
prohibition by a 10 percentage point
[SPEAKER_04]: margin in 2012 and have continued to
support it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Within the regulated marketplace,
teens appear to have been prevented from
[SPEAKER_04]: making illegal purchases.
[SPEAKER_04]: The legal sale of recreational and medical
marijuana has been lucrative for the
[SPEAKER_04]: state, generating about $30 million in
taxes and fees.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Colorado Legislative Council forecasts
that in the first full fiscal year of
[SPEAKER_04]: legal recreational sales, the state will
rake in $47.7 million.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_04]: If Oregon passes Measure 91, the state's
financial estimate committee projects that
[SPEAKER_04]: additional tax revenues could range from
$17 million to $40 million annually.
[SPEAKER_04]: A recent study from the personal finance
site NerdWallet placed the forecast range
[SPEAKER_04]: for Oregon between $50 million and $100
million in tax revenue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Voters in Alaska and the District of
Columbia will also decide whether to
[SPEAKER_04]: legalize recreational cannabis on November
4th.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, you know what I'm going to say?
[SPEAKER_04]: Go vote.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go vote to legalize recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you are in Alaska and the District of
Columbia, you better be voting November
[SPEAKER_04]: 4th.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you are in Oregon, go vote.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys have to make this happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't bitch and complain if you don't
vote.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have a mail-in ballot, mail it in.
[SPEAKER_04]: November 4th is your day.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, guys, I feel like that's enough
of me ranting and that's also enough news.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I hadn't done a news episode
in a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been packing episodes really full of
a lot of stuff and been leaving the news
[SPEAKER_04]: out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's start wrapping up the show,
guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who gets a shout out this week?
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to send a big shout out again to
Sweet Leaf Farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to send a huge shout out to Task
Rock.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for letting me play your music in
the background.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, you're listening to Task Rock,
TNL The Movement.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, a huge shout out to Angela.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, girl?
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, these guys don't pay for this
advertisement, but a big, huge,
[SPEAKER_04]: extra thank you to the Mate Factor in
Manitou Springs.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're ever in Manitou Springs and you
need a vegetarian treat, stop in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got great wraps and sandwiches.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get yourself a dark roast mate.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll be wired up for the whole day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to the Mate Factor.
[SPEAKER_04]: They always take good care of us.
[SPEAKER_04]: I drive an hour to go eat there and an
hour back.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's how good that place is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check me out in the next episode because
Jesse should be here if all goes well.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will talk more about building your grow
room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we'll have another episode that is
not about building.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll do an episode about grow
tents is what I think is coming up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll start getting back on track
about more grow lessons and stuff like
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's do the part where we wrap up the
show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where did I put that paper?
[SPEAKER_04]: It helps to be prepared, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, also, I do need a theme song for the
show so I can quit playing Task Rock and
[SPEAKER_04]: make a tea and that cheesy reggae song
that I made.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys have any musical skills,
I like dance hall reggae, maybe a nice
[SPEAKER_04]: roots reggae beat, something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just something that's chill that I could
play in the background while I talk or
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe at the opening of the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not begging.
