[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, happy Monday everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is time for episode 481 of the Grow
From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need new regular, feminized or auto
flower seeds in your garden, I highly
[SPEAKER_02]: recommend Seeds Here Now and you can find
them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I like to start this podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, I've been taking way too many dabs
of Mai Tai full spectrum extract from
[SPEAKER_02]: Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a blend of Sunset Sherb and Purple
Punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the package, the flavor is described as
tropical fruit cocktail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will completely agree with the tropical
fruit cocktail description, but I think
[SPEAKER_02]: there is also a hint of something like Old
Man Aftershave or Old Man Cologne.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gives it sort of a sharp, bright smell
and I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also really enjoy the buzz on the back
of the container.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says this product contains 71.12% THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: and non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really enjoy the flavor and I absolutely
enjoy the buzz of the Mai Tai full
[SPEAKER_02]: spectrum extract from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So big shout out to the crew at Green Dot.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this episode, I'm going to do a strain
description.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about the strain
Scarlet Begonias.

[SPEAKER_02]: At the start of the show, I said I was
going to do a strain review on a strain I
[SPEAKER_02]: created called Scarlet Bagonias.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's not waste too much time in this
episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get right to a strain review.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about Scarlet Bagonias.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do a little bit of catch up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe people are not familiar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to get you up to speed, I am Rasta
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am the founder, the proprietor and sole
breeder for IRE Genetics Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: I make fine, regular and feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of my stuff is focused on being high
THC with a lot of great fruity and unique
[SPEAKER_02]: aromas and flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do offer feminized seeds, but in this
episode we're going to focus on regular
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have been using a wonderful male for my
male female seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have been using a male known as King
Solomon.
[SPEAKER_02]: King Solomon is a select cut of a rise.
[SPEAKER_02]: A rise is a female golden goat pollinated
by a male daybreaker plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That female daybreaker brings a sweet
tropical island sort of a flavor to the
[SPEAKER_02]: mix while the daybreaker is Chem D crossed
to Joseph O.G.
[SPEAKER_02]: that brings a lot of gassy, cushy,
sort of earthy, funky aromas to the mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a rise brings a lot of sweet,
tropical, gassy, cushy, sort of a tropical
[SPEAKER_02]: kush sort of a flavor and aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: A rise is known to be a very potent
strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have seen many test results in the high
20s and low 30s.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen as high as 35% THC in the arise.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have also seen a rise create amazing
progeny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything I use this King Solomon male on
turns into magic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a little background on the male
plant that I used in the cross of scarlet
[SPEAKER_02]: begonias.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am using an arise plant that is a cross
of a golden goat female and a daybreaker
[SPEAKER_02]: male.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went through a lot of seeds to find the
male that met my standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that I chose to keep has been
named King Solomon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is the male half of the scarlet
begonia cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk a little bit about the female
half of this scarlet begonias cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: The female plant that I used for the cross
of scarlet begonias was a plant known as
[SPEAKER_02]: red headed stranger.
[SPEAKER_02]: I acquired my red headed stranger cut from
a commercial cultivation facility in
[SPEAKER_02]: Pueblo West Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved watching it grow because it grew
giant colas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved watching it grow because it grew
with great vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved watching it grow because it turned
amazing colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I liked watching the harvest crew
attack it because it was really easy to
[SPEAKER_02]: trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I really liked it because when the
lab test came back, it always had
[SPEAKER_02]: impressive numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then once we got it to the shelf,
it always sold really quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I knew that that red headed stranger
was a very special plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I would find myself adjusting my
grow schedules around the red headed
[SPEAKER_02]: stranger because it would veg so much more
quickly than other plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there were many great reasons why I
fell in love with the red headed stranger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about what the genetics of red
headed stranger are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Red headed stranger is a cross of Tom
Hill's haze and Williams wonder.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the thing that stands out to me there
is the word haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got haze in our genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now let's segue into talking about what
happened when I crossed the red headed
[SPEAKER_02]: stranger to the arise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the very first thing I noticed when I
was growing scarlet begonias from seed,
[SPEAKER_02]: the very first time was that these plants
are hyper vigorous.
[SPEAKER_02]: These plants will grow very quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally I veg in a six inch net pot for
two or three weeks, maybe four weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I go to a three gallon pot and I veg
there for two or three more weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to reduce my veg time by two weeks
because these plants were trying to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: up into the lights and they were
outgrowing the rest of the plants in the
[SPEAKER_02]: room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I noticed right away that these plants
have hyper vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now another thing that became very obvious
late in veg, early in flower is that these
[SPEAKER_02]: plants do express quite a bit of variation
in phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I know that most folks like to hear
that there are only one or two phenotypes
[SPEAKER_02]: available in a cross, but to be quite
honest with you, there are a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: very varying phenotypes in this cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I know that stability and uniformity
are something that growers really look
[SPEAKER_02]: for, but I like the offspring,
the results of this cross so well that I
[SPEAKER_02]: think it is worth sifting through the
seeds to find the phenotype that works
[SPEAKER_02]: best for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually I talk about aromas and flavors
first, but this strain deserves to talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about some of the phenotypes right here at
the start of the strain review.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the phenotypes you will find in
these scarlet begonias are quite tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those come from the haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: The haze genetics really make these plants
take off.
[SPEAKER_02]: But on the opposite side of that spectrum,
you will find some very short,
[SPEAKER_02]: very squat, very stout plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't get very tall, but they do get
very wide.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen these plants grown in a seven
gallon pot and some of them get as wide as
[SPEAKER_02]: the seven gallon pot and only grew about
four feet tall, while other plants in the
[SPEAKER_02]: same room in the same seven gallon pots
were about eight feet tall and need to be
[SPEAKER_02]: bent over so they don't grow into the
light.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is some drastic variation in the
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, some of those taller haze
dominant phenotypes are going to take much
[SPEAKER_02]: longer to finish than some of those
shorter Chem-D, Josepho-G, Romulan kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: dominant phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of those phenotypes that are shorter
and squattier finish around eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the taller phenotypes can finish
around 10 or as long as 11 weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: In most cases, you are going to find
phenotypes that typically finish around
[SPEAKER_02]: nine weeks, but there will be outliers
that finish at the end of week seven and
[SPEAKER_02]: there will be outliers that take as long
as 11 weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said earlier, I could tell that
these plants were growing with hypervigour
[SPEAKER_02]: early in veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I flip these plants into flower,
I can tell really quickly which are going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be my haze dominant phenotypes and
which are going to be my more squatty,
[SPEAKER_02]: Romulan, OG Kush dominant phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can certainly see the middle 50-50
phenotypes that I find to be the most
[SPEAKER_02]: desirable.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think they really show which
phenotypes you have got quite early.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've got one that starts bushing
out, you know you've got that bushy,
[SPEAKER_02]: short, squatty phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that one is Romulan dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you start getting one that grows really
tall, as soon as you put it in flower,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that one is Tom, Hills,
Haze dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get one that stays right in the
middle and it's got a big fat purple cola
[SPEAKER_02]: right up the middle at the end,
I think that is the 50-50 hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the most desirable phenotype in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk a little bit more about these
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The shorter phenotype will, of course,
flower more quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also wants a little bit more food than
these taller phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shorter one is going to eat very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wants to take a lot of nutrients and it
seems to want a little bit more Kalmag.
[SPEAKER_02]: The taller phenotype wants less nutrients
overall, but it does seem like I can feed
[SPEAKER_02]: it more frequently.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I feed it too much at one time,
it gets a little bit picky.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were feeding that short,
squat phenotype, 100% of your nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: mix, you may want to reduce that to about
75-70% for that tall stretchier phenotype
[SPEAKER_02]: because it is going to want less overall
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, with that being said, scarlet
begonias plants do have a tendency to
[SPEAKER_02]: become nitrogen deficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: The golden goat parent is known to eat a
lot of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: I often go to a commercial facility and
see golden goat visibly displaying macro
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the golden goat makes her want to eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scarlet begonias was an eater.
[SPEAKER_02]: In many grow environments, I would see
that scarlet begonias would yellow up a
[SPEAKER_02]: little more early than many of the plants,
which indicates she needs more nitrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: early in flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So crossing that scarlet begonias to a
golden goat dominant hybrid really brought
[SPEAKER_02]: out the need for nutrients in the scarlet
begonias.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep an eye on your scarlet begonias
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you see any yellowing late in veg or
early in flower, you really need to jump
[SPEAKER_02]: on the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't try to overdose it at once and feed
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just slowly increase the amount of
nitrogen which you are feeding the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, you may want to consider a foliar
feed if you are seeing too much yellowing
[SPEAKER_02]: too early.
[SPEAKER_02]: So scarlet begonias is an eater.
[SPEAKER_02]: The shorter, bushier phenotypes will eat
more nutrients than the taller,
[SPEAKER_02]: thinner phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But overall, this plant likes a lot of
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I have noticed, the shorter,
squattier phenotypes like a lower pH than
[SPEAKER_02]: normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're running 6.2 most of the time,
you may be able to get down to 6.0.
[SPEAKER_02]: The shorter, squattier phenotypes seem to
like lower pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also require more CalMag and also
they seem to tolerate low temperatures
[SPEAKER_02]: better than the taller phenotypes,
which makes a lot of sense because that
[SPEAKER_02]: taller phenotype probably has the genetics
that came from a more tropical
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can take a little bit more heat than
the shorter phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, that taller phenotype likes a little
bit more nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So make sure you're beefing that one up
with nitrogen so that you don't get those
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I have noticed through all grow
environments with the scarlet begonias is
[SPEAKER_02]: that all of the phenotypes can handle more
heat than most plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did say that shorter phenotype likes it
colder but it can handle high heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've got a high heat, high stress
grow environment, scarlet begonias may
[SPEAKER_02]: work for you in that type of a situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: She also loves high amounts of CO2
augmentation throughout flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can really beef up these buds with
proper feeding and augmented CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that brings me to another very
important point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure to have plenty of airflow in
your grow room if you are growing scarlet
[SPEAKER_02]: begonias.
[SPEAKER_02]: These plants will produce giant buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And big buds do get the potential for
problems if you don't have proper airflow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So make sure you've got proper airflow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you've got good fans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you've got good air exchange.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you've got good VPD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully you've got high CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are a few environmental factors
that will help you dial in your scarlet
[SPEAKER_02]: begonias plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing I should mention is that
some of these phenotypes are going to get
[SPEAKER_02]: very tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I keep saying that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't express how tall some of these
phenotypes are going to get and how
[SPEAKER_02]: quickly it can happen on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them may really take off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them will double or almost triple
in size throughout the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you ask about the stretch time,
some of them have the potential to triple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of them will double.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some do have the potential to triple their
size by the time they are done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've got a two foot tall plant,
you flip it into flower, it could be six
[SPEAKER_02]: feet tall by the time it is done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I definitely recommend some sort of a
stake or a trellis system.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to need some supports for
these giant plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the shorter, squattier phenotype
really likes to be topped.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really takes well to being topped and
spread out even further like a bush.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can top the taller phenotype,
but I've noticed it responds by getting a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit stretchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you take out that main apical top,
the rest of those branches really start
[SPEAKER_02]: competing to be come the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will make the plant stretch and get
really tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will work, but it will create quite a
bit of recovery stretch.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a tall, skinny phenotype
that shows a lot of OG Kush traits,
[SPEAKER_02]: it will stretch a little bit more after a
topping than the haze dominant tall
[SPEAKER_02]: phenotype of the scarlet begonias.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that may sound odd to some folks who
have not grown a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me explain that a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_02]: OG Kush plants tend to get a little bit
stretchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may find quite a bit of space between
internode spacing and between bud sites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Haze plants will grow really tall and
stretchy, but I don't find as much space
[SPEAKER_02]: between the nodes and the bud sites.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you may have a scarlet begonias
phenotype that is getting tall and
[SPEAKER_02]: stretchy, but think about how far apart
the bud sites and what your node spacing
[SPEAKER_02]: looks like, and that will help you
determine if it is leaning more toward the
[SPEAKER_02]: OG Kush side or if it is leaning toward
the haze side of the bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, the Kush is going to be further
apart and the haze is going to have closer
[SPEAKER_02]: together internodes and bud sets.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have got an OG Kush dominant
phenotype, you are absolutely going to
[SPEAKER_02]: need more Kalmag through the flowering
cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have got the haze dominant
phenotype, you may want a little bit more
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen early in the flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got that short, bushy,
wide phenotype, feed the shit out of her
[SPEAKER_02]: and she will be completely happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that covers the grow details of
scarlet begonias.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk a little bit about the
consumption aspect of this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: What does it smell and taste like,
and how does it make me feel?
[SPEAKER_02]: Scarlet begonias has a wonderful array of
flavors and aromas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the phenotypes will smell like
green apples and green jolly ranchers or
[SPEAKER_02]: sour apple candies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them have a hint of cinnamon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them have a hint of sandalwood,
and I call that a hazy aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some phenotypes have a hint of roses and
white wine, and some of them have hints of
[SPEAKER_02]: light, dirty feet and musky, earthy
undertones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you are more likely to find the dirty
feet and funky type phenotypes on those
[SPEAKER_02]: shorter, squattier plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are more likely to find the green
apples and jolly rancher type phenotypes
[SPEAKER_02]: in the taller, skinnier plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each phenotype is going to have green
apples and kind of a hazy flavor,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they'll all have a musky, funky sort
of aroma, but the shorter ones are
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely going to be more of the cushy,
musky side of the aroma, and the tall,
[SPEAKER_02]: thin ones are where you're going to find
those green apple, cinnamon, champagne
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of aromas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the taller, really longer
finishing phenotypes will develop a
[SPEAKER_02]: peppery or almost a spicy flavor and aroma
if you let them go long enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it is really unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a green apple or a green jolly
rancher that you set on a jalapeno for
[SPEAKER_02]: just a second and got some of that zing to
it, and I think it is a really delicious
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also think that that really tall
phenotype with that peppery flavor packs
[SPEAKER_02]: an amazing, amazing head buzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: So most of your phenotypes are going to
hold, I keep saying it, but green apples,
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of fruity, funky, musty feet,
sandalwood.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll get some roses.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll get some champagne or white wine in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some phenotypes may even hold
what I have been calling a spicy apple
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of a flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now let's talk about the way scarlet
begonias makes me feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really enjoy the buzz of scarlet
begonias.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the phenotypes seem to get to my
eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get a nice eye high, a nice face buzz,
and I don't know if that makes any sense
[SPEAKER_02]: to you, but I remember when I first
started smoking weed, my eyes would get
[SPEAKER_02]: real heavy and I could tell they were
bloody red and I could tell they were hard
[SPEAKER_02]: to keep open and it just felt like there
was weight on my eyelids and maybe my
[SPEAKER_02]: cheeks were a little bit pink and my
forehead felt a little bit heavy and
[SPEAKER_02]: scarlet begonias brings that feeling back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that has been removed from
some of the new popular weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I don't get that feeling as
much from dabs, but when I smoke scarlet
[SPEAKER_02]: begonias flowers, something just goes
across my face and makes me feel silly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of makes me feel like I'm wearing
a Zorro mask or maybe one of those Ninja
[SPEAKER_02]: Turtle masks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a little mask right around my eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: My face isn't hidden, but I can feel it
right there on my face.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can feel something and it feels good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes me remember what it was like when
I first started smoking cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: when that stoned, buzzy feeling used to
take over.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you've been smoking forever,
you don't get that anymore, I feel like,
[SPEAKER_02]: but scarlet begonias brings that back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get that nice eye buzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get stoned and it feels like as soon
as you exhale, you can feel that stoniness
[SPEAKER_02]: come over your face.
[SPEAKER_02]: You like hit it, you puff and then you
blow out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I just feel it go like there's a
little face mask buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it feels great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes on super quickly and then it has
no ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have found that there are many strains I
can smoke and burn myself out on.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's smoking to the max today,
I can get to a limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, well, I guess that's as high as I'm
going to get today.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can start smoking at noon and smoke
until three in the morning and you've
[SPEAKER_02]: reached a limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to get past that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like scarlet begonias can push me
right to that next level.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm as stoned as I can get,
scarlet begonias is able to push me right
[SPEAKER_02]: up to that next level, get me over the
hump so I can get even a little bit more
[SPEAKER_02]: high, a little bit more stoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I've been at a concert all day or
whatever, and then I drove home from the
[SPEAKER_02]: concert and been having a good time all
day and now I want to smoke and go to bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Normally I just smoke and go, yeah,
that was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just smoked a little more, smoke a little
scarlet begonias.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I go, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my buzz back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I love that it's got no ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tends to push me right over the limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, for smokers who have been smoking a
long time and they say, oh, I can smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: all the weed in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't do shit to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something in the scarlet begonias
that when those people hit it,
[SPEAKER_02]: they go, wow, I haven't been stoned like
this in a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really like seeing it do that to
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does it to a lot of seasoned smokers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So scarlet begonias seems to be limitless
and have no ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it goes straight to my face.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it kind of gives me the
giggles, but also I feel like if I go too
[SPEAKER_02]: hard, it can kind of give me a little bit
of paranoia, which personally I kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something about being a little bit
paranoid, a little bit bugged out,
[SPEAKER_02]: that feeling of everyone's looking at me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you start getting the giggles.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what comes with being stoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I kind of enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: For a new smoker, it can probably become a
little bit overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scarlet begonias can be super potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So be careful if you are a new smoker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start slow, see what you've grown,
give it a test.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can always smoke a little bit more if
you're not stoned enough, but you can not
[SPEAKER_02]: unsmoke that joint you smoked if you're
too stoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: So start lightly, go a little bit harder
if you feel like you need to.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a couple of downsides to smoking
scarlet begonias.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first downside is that my eyes get
fire red.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scarlet begonias makes my eyes glowing
red.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure why this strain specifically
does that, but it does it more than most
[SPEAKER_02]: other strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scarlet begonias also gives me the most
extreme munchies.
[SPEAKER_02]: After I smoke scarlet begonias,
I want to eat all of the food.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much food do we have?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how much food I need to eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, it gives me extreme intense dry
mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like the munchies and the dry
mouth are related.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is something that brings those on
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are from the same thing because all I
have to do is chug a glass of water and I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't feel that dry mouth or that thirst
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they are connected, but it makes my
eyes completely devil red.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also makes me so hungry and it makes me
so dry and thirsty.
[SPEAKER_02]: But those are my biggest complaints about
scarlet begonias.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes my eyes super red.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gives me crazy munchies and it gives me
a little bit of cotton mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not too big of a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure I can handle all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, that is my report on scarlet
begonias.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me make sure I did not miss anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a couple of notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I overlooked a couple of details.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scarlet begonias will make your eyes feel
squinty.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a note that I wrote.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also I've got the words time travel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like when I smoke scarlet begonias,
sometimes I might time travel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might smoke scarlet begonias at 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next thing I know, it is 6 p.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: I call that time travel weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to figure out blood that makes me
go backwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be the million dollar project.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for now, we're going to time travel
forward when we smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: The last note I've got that I skipped over
is great leaf to calyx ratio, which means
[SPEAKER_02]: the buds are huge and there are not a lot
of leaves to trim off.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a great thing for any grower who
doesn't want to waste time trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is an extra great thing for anyone
running a commercial cultivation facility
[SPEAKER_02]: who will have hours and hours of trim work
to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So great leaf to calyx ratio on the
scarlet begonias.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, that wraps up my report on
[SPEAKER_02]: scarlet begonias.

[SPEAKER_01]: She was not like other girls, other girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the thick of the evening when the
dealer got rough, she was too packed to
[SPEAKER_01]: open and too cool to blow.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I picked up my matches and was closing
the door, I had one of those last shoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd been there before, been there before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I ain't always right, but I've never
been wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's never turned out the way it does in
the song.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once in a while, you get shown the light
in the strangest of places if you look at
[SPEAKER_01]: it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there ain't nothing wrong with the
way she moves.
[SPEAKER_01]: All scarlet begonias are in touch with the
blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's nothing wrong with the look
that's in her eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to learn the hard way to let her
pass by, let her pass by.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wind and the willows play G-Fortune.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sky was yellow and the sun was blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strangers stopping strangers just to shake
their hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's playing in the heart of gold
band, heart of gold band.
Ah.
Ah.
Ah.
Ah.
Ah.

Ah.

[SPEAKER_00]: Ah.
