[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, what's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for episode number 32 of the I
Grow Culture podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your host, Ross DeGeoff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joining me today on the mic, we got our
buddy, Adam, with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up with you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hanging out, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taking some dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give a big shout out to our
buddy, Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike was supposed to come join us on the
show today, but Mike, he hurt himself.
[SPEAKER_02]: He hurt his back, so he's laid up.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's taken a night off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get feeling better, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get well, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll take some dabs for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, on the last episode, I said that I
was gonna make videos of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Making a video is a big pain in the ass,
and it really detracts from the quality of
[SPEAKER_02]: the show, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was too distracted by toys and
equipment, and I wasn't able to make a
[SPEAKER_02]: good podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've decided to not make videos of the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I will do is keep making cheesy-ass
YouTube videos with iMovie and just put up
[SPEAKER_02]: videos that are mostly still shots.
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be some video in there,
but it'll mostly be stills of stuff that
[SPEAKER_02]: is involved in the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take pictures of rigs, pictures of
plants, pictures of the guests,
[SPEAKER_02]: pictures of myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be stuff like that, because doing a
video really wasn't very fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna fade out this music here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to Kat and Coot and the
Mystic Roots Band.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for letting me play your music on
the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you guys follow the Mystic Roots
Band.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of putting pictures of rigs up,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I got a new rig today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to at LSD Gallery on
Instagram, and also big shout out to at
[SPEAKER_02]: Slugworth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's Slugworth Glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have researched that,
but check out Slugworth Glass,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever they're called on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will tweet a link to that so you can
find them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ordered the Master Shake Rig from LSD
Gallery.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little smaller than I expected,
but boy, do I approve.
[SPEAKER_02]: Came with this super awesome chainsaw
dabber here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this little handle here,
they're encouraging me to wear this as a
[SPEAKER_02]: pendant, is what I think's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this rig is certainly designed to be
worn as a pendant.
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing, I think Adam said,
what is that, three inches tall?
[SPEAKER_02]: About three inches.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about three inches tall,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm super satisfied.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys are looking for good glass
that will get shipped to you at a
[SPEAKER_02]: reasonable price from good people that do
good business.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's thick.
[SPEAKER_02]: The glass is thicker than it looks like
it's gonna be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's nice and heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not clear, so you can't see the
thickness of the glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you look at the straw and see even
the handles and stuff, it is thick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you handle it, you appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this Master Shake Rig is stylish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super stylish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well worth every penny I spent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It got shipped here super quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It went out the day after I paid for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I paid for it on Sunday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a tracking number when I woke up
Monday morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you need glass, check them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're called at LSD Gallery.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're pretty fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also a big shout out to Task Rock because
when I ordered my new rig, of course I had
[SPEAKER_02]: to get, it's a little 10 millimeter rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my first 10 mil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the bigger stuff, honestly,
but this little one is cute and I love the
[SPEAKER_02]: way it hits.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be my new, just when I'm dabbing
it by myself, that'll be my new personal
[SPEAKER_02]: rig.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Task.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got myself a purple carb cap and a
little 10 mil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trinitide nail to put on my rig and it
works perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Satisfied.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: At LSD Gallery and at Task Rock and at
Slugworth Glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to research the Slugworth one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at Highly Educated Titanium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Highly Educated Titanium.

[SPEAKER_02]: Glass on Broadway.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to take, Adam hasn't been there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've gone and been for several times
together and I have not taken you to
[SPEAKER_02]: Illusion's.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm probably in the market of
purchasing a rig, so I may need a nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was going to ask you earlier where I
can pick one up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Illusion's Glass in Denver does carry
highly educated products.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have all kinds of sick glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just a glass shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a gallery.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like a written commercial.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, that sounds fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking awesome.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I owe a dollar because I just said
the F word again.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys get me on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting on episode 30, every time I say
the F word, I owe a dollar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys are going to hold me to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, to a charity.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time we get to episode 35,
I'll start doing $5 every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to stop saying that word.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's lit by me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it doesn't.

slip by.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you guys for listening and making
some money for the person that's sick that
[SPEAKER_02]: actually needs some money.

[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to take a quick dab and
then we will be back for the news.
[SPEAKER_02]: While we take dabs, I'm just going to turn
up the music.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some Mystic Roots band playing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is a hundred dollar bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a hundred dollar bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're going to take a dab real quick
while this plays.
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe the mic's on so you can hear
Adam Cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of which, I got to say a big
shout out to Bender and 420th.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been doing it while I'm away and
held it down while I couldn't be on the
[SPEAKER_02]: internet and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the people back out East, we do not
care.
[SPEAKER_02]: Murphy's Grow, you know who you are,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Half of the guys from the 420th just found
out that I've been on.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just thought I was spamming your
podcast and it's like, man, pay attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was stoned when I wrote it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should make a little bit of sense at
least.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: The choke fist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I owe a big shout out to Bender as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bender, if you're listening, thanks,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You made me three logos and all three of
them look good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet as shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep them coming, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep them coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll give you more shout outs on the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the best I can do for now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the long run, we'll make it up to
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll make it worth it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a cool dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't ask for anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just volunteered and made me some
pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I read genetics logos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, how about an I grow culture logo
that I can make a sticker out of?
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you know, I'll put the request in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just tell him that he doesn't even
tell the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, don't even tell him just that way if
he listens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we'll find out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That music was loud while we were talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're taking some dabs of stuff blasted
by my good buddy at Garden of Weedon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Follow Garden of Weedon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Garden of Weed N on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I'm coughing after a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, I hope you're taking dabs with us
while we're dabbing on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Using those highly educated nails.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some tasty stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that tasty?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's some Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to hit the Hitman rig because
hitting that little mini slug worth would
[SPEAKER_02]: just make us cough for an hour on the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: The Garden of Weedon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's what I just, I think that's
what I was just saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you said we were doing that,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to Garden of Weedon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I slipped.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were in dab world.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had that dab bubble around your head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam's going to be all right, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll just give him a minute to catch up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You there?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You good?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: You good?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, they also, they follow me on
Instagram and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Call your mom.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think it'll make the podcast
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're sitting here with, can I say your
line?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Miss G, we're sitting here with your son
and he's dabbed the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering if you could just talk him
down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the thing is I'll sit here and I'll
encourage people like, yeah, go follow and
[SPEAKER_02]: troll the shit out of her, you know,
on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't really care.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you want people to troll your
mom.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mom doesn't have any social media and
I'm glad about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty glad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad about it, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just rambling.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're having a personal conversation
because we just took dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rather talk, have just some rambles
that are incoherent instead of trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: read the news while I'm choking over a
little intermission.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is going to go up probably Monday,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it should go up Monday morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you guys like that bonus little
miniature episode that I put out Thursday
[SPEAKER_02]: night?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that cool or what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been trying to catch up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to go out tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one as we're recording.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll post another one when we finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll have this one going.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm getting ahead of myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is on Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm living in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're living in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm living.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to live in the now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, if you've got social media,
if you've got Facebook, if you've got
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitter, if you've got YouTube,
if you've watched TV in the past couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: days, you have seen the anchor lady.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, excuse my dollar on this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, don't charge me a dollar for this
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: This lady went on TV and she made a nice
long speech and her speech ended with fuck
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I quit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys know what I'm talking about,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to read an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if I could play the video.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I play the video and not get in
trouble?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's from the news.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the news played the hell out of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't get permission.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe they did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's turn down the music and let's try to
play this video because I'm going to play
[SPEAKER_02]: a quick video and you guys this happened
on the news and then I'll read the story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, everything you heard is why I'm the
actual owner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it sounds like shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even going to play it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, shit, give me a second, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to press pause.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to search for the actual good
quality video and I'll play it for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I owe you that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a little bit of searching.
[SPEAKER_02]: The video comes in kind of late.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should fill you in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: This lady, the news ran a report about
medical cannabis or cannabis in Alaska and
[SPEAKER_02]: this lady was reporting on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then during her report, she states
that she supports cannabis and that she
[SPEAKER_02]: actually is the owner of the Alaska
Cannabis Club.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is kind of where just to get you
up to speed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where she jumps in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll play the video now and hopefully
they don't take it off of all of the
[SPEAKER_02]: servers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, everything you heard is why I,
the actual owner of the Alaska Cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: Club, will be dedicating all of my energy
toward fighting for freedom and fairness,
[SPEAKER_03]: which begins with legalizing marijuana
here in Alaska.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as for this job, well, not that I have
a choice, but fuck it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I quit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you heard it right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next lady on the news,
the camera pops back up to the other lady
[SPEAKER_02]: in the news and this lady, the other
co-host looks like she pissed her pants
[SPEAKER_02]: when she said that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so this lady goes on the news and
she's a news reporter and you heard it
[SPEAKER_02]: right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: She just said, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I quit live on the news.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to get into the article.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll make a little more sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I quit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anchor explains her dramatic exit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And guys don't charge me a dollar for all
of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the article.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just relaying the news.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I read who it's by?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I said who it's by.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's by Molly Riley.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm going to get me a dirty,
nasty, recycled jar to bring over here and
[SPEAKER_02]: set on your table during these podcasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just so you feel dirty, even dirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to put it like, you have to
stick it to the bottom of the jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: The F jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: The F jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it says, the local news anchor who
dramatically quit her job on air following
[SPEAKER_02]: a segment on marijuana explained her exit
in a YouTube video released Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Charlo Green, a reporter for Anchorage's
KTVA announced on air that she would be
[SPEAKER_02]: leaving her job at the TV station to focus
on marijuana legalization in Alaska.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I said, they ran the clip about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then she says this, everything you've
heard is why I, the actual owner of the
[SPEAKER_02]: Alaska Cannabis Club will be dedicating
all of my energy toward fighting for
[SPEAKER_02]: freedom and fairness, which begins with
legalizing marijuana here in Alaska,
[SPEAKER_02]: she said.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as for this job, well, not that I have
a choice, but fuck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I quit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where she stirred up a lot of
controversy.
[SPEAKER_02]: She, in my opinion, the attention should
have been on her advocacy, her support and
[SPEAKER_02]: her fight to legalize and support
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, she chose one wrong word on the
air on TV and distracted it from all of
[SPEAKER_02]: what she was trying to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: She said the word that cost me a dollar on
the air, on TV.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that Adam pointed it out that that TV
station is going to face a fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: The FCC is going to do something,
even if it was early morning and there was
[SPEAKER_02]: very small numbers.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So still, yeah, it could have,
that looked like a normal... The FCC goes
[SPEAKER_02]: from like 2,500 to like, you know,
250,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: She'll probably end up paying the fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can they fine her?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: They may be able to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But still that was rude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And her choice of words distracted from
her whole fight.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made her kind of look bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: She could have quit on air and probably
sent a better message, but it wouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: have been heard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wouldn't have been heard so broadly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would not have been heard by the
non-pop community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since everybody has seen this on... The
day it happened, I opened up my Facebook
[SPEAKER_02]: and it was all anybody had posted all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So apparently she got herself popular the
way she was trying to do, but she could
[SPEAKER_02]: have done a little bit better of a job.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then there's also the, you know,
I'm not saying that the marijuana business
[SPEAKER_02]: is going to fail, but maybe she hits a
snafu and it kind of crumbles from
[SPEAKER_02]: underneath her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe she trusts the wrong partner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or there's some kind of illegal... There's
all kinds of things that could happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from here on out, she's never getting
a reporting job again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're never getting on any kind
of cable access, let alone, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: making a comedy show.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, maybe that.
[SPEAKER_02]: She can come on our podcast whenever she'd
like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the open invitation.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll keep going with the article.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the YouTube clip, Green explained why
she believes the fight for marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization in her home state is so
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: There comes a time in each and every one
of our lives where we must choose to
[SPEAKER_02]: continue to spectate or stand up for
what's right, she said.
[SPEAKER_02]: She continued, advocating for freedom and
fairness should be everybody's duty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making it my life work to uphold what
America stands for truly, life,
[SPEAKER_02]: liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ideals now need to be defended.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of agree with her there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with her, but as I've been told
numerous times throughout my life,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not what you do, it's how you do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as hearing it over and over again is
you shouldn't have said F, you shouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: have said five.
[SPEAKER_02]: You shouldn't have said this, you know,
I hear it constantly, but if that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: type of person who you are and you're able
to stand up to that scrutiny, I'm I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: back that, you know, I'm not the type of
person to bite my tongue, especially if
[SPEAKER_02]: you cross me and I felt like I haven't
done anything wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they were going to fire her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck that company, you know, one hundred
percent, they weren't going to fire her
[SPEAKER_02]: until she said that she owned that
cannabis club and why she was legit
[SPEAKER_02]: anyway, she's got a backup job,
so she could have just said, and I,
[SPEAKER_02]: since that's probably my last report,
so it was nice seeing you guys have a good
[SPEAKER_02]: night instead of fuck it, I quit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it wouldn't have blown up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it wouldn't have blown up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you had the opportunity to go on
the news in front of camera, would you
[SPEAKER_02]: rather say, and tonight I respectfully
design, or would you rather be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you suck, you suck, you suck, fuck it,
I quit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but you being my friend would
kind of stand back and say, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: don't be you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the last line of the article says
Alaskans are set to vote on ballot measure
[SPEAKER_02]: two, which would legalize possession of
small amounts of marijuana for
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational use in November.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado and Washington have implemented
similar legislation in the last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck have they been doing up
there?
[SPEAKER_02]: They've made it against the law to like
drink in separate counties.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was ballot initiative one,
I'm guessing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And ballot initiative two is to maybe
legalize marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, did you hear the ratio a minute ago
when it was like every 30 seconds an
[SPEAKER_02]: American is arrested for pot in every 4.3
minutes in- 4.3 hours in Alaska.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, what a big fucking ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are they doing up there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Arresting moose?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, hey, get out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all after the moose knuckles.
[SPEAKER_02]: The moose knuckles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, well hopefully they legalize
possession of small amounts of marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: for recreational use in November.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be freaking awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would give us a lot less to watch on
Alaskan state troopers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aww.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So guys tweet me what you think about this
lady.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen so much about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what you think about this lady.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have more to contribute to our
conversation, let me know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be glad to hear it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Add to it, add to the conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep the conversation going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did she screw herself by using the
language she did or did she actually help
[SPEAKER_02]: herself out by using that language?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I want to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please comment because see, I'm on the
border of I'm down with saying fuck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I quit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then all my friends who have
respectable businesses and and respectable
[SPEAKER_02]: things would be like, no, you really
should.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's usually afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's usually at this point in
time where we're talking now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So probably shouldn't have done that,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many times have I said that to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to strike a lot, a lot more than
my parents did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took you a lot less time to figure it
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm good after that, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once I say, bro, do you realize that
you're just about to put nitro and
[SPEAKER_02]: glycerin in the same container and shake
it up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you see that coming?
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you go, oh yeah, I have nitro and
glycerin in the same container.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once I warn you, you're pretty on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have been guilty to fail.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you got to fail to learn how
many, if you try stuff and you do it
[SPEAKER_02]: perfectly, you're like, I'm fucking good
at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I owe a dollar for that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you do something and you fail and
you're like, boy, I'm humbled.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really failed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to learn how to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't learn anything the first time
you get stuff.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where'd that article go?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam actually brought this article to my
attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's written by Jeremy P. Meyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found this on thedenverpost.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says Colorado schools out millions due
to marijuana excise tax loophole.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's not, they're not out.
[SPEAKER_02]: This sounds like they had millions in
their pockets and somebody reached in and
[SPEAKER_02]: took it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the way this went.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the way I read it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I read this article.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little misleading, but they have to
do that with headlines to get you to read
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The schools did get kind of punked a
little bit, but it wasn't a loophole.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a business move and it wasn't
aimed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody was like, let's screw the schools.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just what business people were
doing because it's how business was being
[SPEAKER_02]: done at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: How the law was wrote.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it says a loophole built into
Colorado's marijuana system has allowed
[SPEAKER_02]: thousands of pounds of pot to go untaxed
and has cost the state millions of dollars
[SPEAKER_02]: that should have gone to school
construction fund.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2012, Colorado voters overwhelmingly
approved amendment 64, which among other
[SPEAKER_02]: things, promised that the first $40
million in excise tax revenue would be
[SPEAKER_02]: dedicated every year for the state school
construction fund.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this year only about $10 million is
expected to be raised thanks to a rule
[SPEAKER_02]: that allows marijuana retailers to avoid
paying the tax in a one-time transfer of
[SPEAKER_02]: wholesale pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I had to clear my face there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Surely revenue will increase over time as
the industry continues to mature and fewer
[SPEAKER_02]: license holders are able to use the
one-time tax-free transfer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what they're able to do, I haven't read
far enough into the article here,
[SPEAKER_02]: but what they're able to do, shops that
have medical marijuana are able to move it
[SPEAKER_02]: from their medical marijuana side to their
recreational marijuana side to make it
[SPEAKER_02]: available for everybody instead of just
medical patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there must be a tax pay when that
happens because the taxes are different on
[SPEAKER_02]: the medical side and the rec side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Colorado tried to protect the medical
side a little bit by doing this,
[SPEAKER_02]: but in my opinion, it has failed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll continue into the article.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether the excise tax revenue will ever
reach 40 million is anyone's guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: My suspicion is the amount will never be
attained as and was a high in the sky
[SPEAKER_02]: figure meant to attract voters.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that sounds familiar, you may be
remembering the 2008 campaign for
[SPEAKER_02]: amendment 50 that promised 182 million
over five years to community colleges from
[SPEAKER_02]: the expansion of gaming.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, only 25.3 million has been
generated through the fiscal year 2012 to
[SPEAKER_02]: 2013.
[SPEAKER_02]: Half the people are spending their money
on pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marijuana excise tax revenues would
certainly grow if the loophole that was
[SPEAKER_02]: created by regulators to launch the
industry was closed.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are still 275 license holders who
could take advantage of it according to
[SPEAKER_02]: one source.
[SPEAKER_02]: The loophole was created to make sure
enough pot would be in the retail
[SPEAKER_02]: marketplace when doors opened on January
1st, 2014.
[SPEAKER_02]: Regulators allowed medical marijuana
licensees converting to retail a one time
[SPEAKER_02]: tax-free transfer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That transfer was a big difference between
Colorado and Washington, the other state
[SPEAKER_02]: that legalized retail marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I had to reread that sentence
because it looked weird to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something didn't sound right, but okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That transfer was the big difference is
what it should say between Colorado and
[SPEAKER_02]: Washington, the other state that legalized
retail marijuana and why the Centennial
[SPEAKER_02]: State was out the door first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Washington had to grow its retail crop
from seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado officials say 9,711 pounds of
medical pot was transferred tax-free to
[SPEAKER_02]: retail.
[SPEAKER_02]: 4,724 pounds of medical marijuana was
moved to retail marijuana products and
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacturers, and 8,576 pounds of medical
pot was transferred to retail marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: That last tranche will be subject to the
tax once it is transferred or sold to
[SPEAKER_02]: another marijuana establishment.
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be taxes made on this,
just not that original transfer tax.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it says, it is estimated the untaxed
pot would have provided $3 million for the
[SPEAKER_02]: state school construction fund or twice
what the fund received in the fiscal year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kathy Gerpar, a member of the public
school capital construction assistance
[SPEAKER_02]: board.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot of words for a board.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big title.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Provide the board that provides grants for
schools, construction and renovation knew
[SPEAKER_02]: the numbers were going to be low after
seeing February's receipts.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first month we were thinking we were
going to be rolling in cash, she said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the second month it was, wait a
minute, we're only getting fractions of
[SPEAKER_02]: what we thought we were going to get in.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was not the voter intent,
she said.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think anyone who voted for
amendment 64 thought this would happen,
[SPEAKER_02]: she said.
[SPEAKER_02]: They thought the money would go to school
kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is coming at the expensive kids in
really needy school districts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, the text is broken up oddly with
ads here, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: The building excellent schools today or
best fund is a competitive grant program
[SPEAKER_02]: that helps districts with capital
construction.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is able to support projects in rural
school districts that don't have large
[SPEAKER_02]: property bases necessary for bond
projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best fund over the years has received
more than $385 million in revenue,
[SPEAKER_02]: 90% from the state land trust.
[SPEAKER_02]: This year, the best fund is helping
construction buildings in the Edson 54 JT
[SPEAKER_02]: school district and supporting projects in
dozens of school districts around the
[SPEAKER_02]: state for things like roof replacements
and boilers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marijuana taxes are providing less than 1%
of the program's funds or $3.1 million.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would have made a big difference,
she said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether there is a tax credit on the other
side, there is somebody to whom the tax
[SPEAKER_02]: credit should have gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Proposition AA, which was approved by
voters in 2013, mandates a 15% excise tax
[SPEAKER_02]: imposed on unprocessed retail marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: But amendment 64 says no excise taxes can
be charged on pot cultivated as medical
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: A transfer logically of medically grown
pot couldn't be taxed, which is the basis
[SPEAKER_02]: for the loophole.
[SPEAKER_02]: The simple solution then is to discontinue
transfers.
[SPEAKER_02]: The state doesn't need them anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: The retail pot industry is up and running
now and doesn't need the influx of medical
[SPEAKER_02]: pot to prop up retail stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, transfers disadvantage retail
growers who have to pay the tax when
[SPEAKER_02]: medical growers don't for that one time
swap.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was never our intent to manipulate the
market, said Rep Dan Pabon.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a correction that needs to be made.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said also a draft bill already had been
written that would stop the transfer after
[SPEAKER_02]: January 1st, 2016.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the loophole should be closed sooner
to match the voter's intent and make good
[SPEAKER_02]: on a promise that the revenue should be
going to schools.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: The revenue should go to the schools,
but... Where's the other money going?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did it get exempt from the schools?
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand 40 million.
[SPEAKER_02]: 40 million sounds like a lot, but did we
not make 40 million in the first 48 hours?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe in total sales, maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what they're saying is they had this
tax set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: This tax was supposed to go here and the
money didn't happen because these guys
[SPEAKER_02]: found a way to not make the money.
[SPEAKER_02]: You read that article not that long ago
where it was $1.9 million of taxable money
[SPEAKER_02]: from this county alone.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's set up to go to different
places.
[SPEAKER_02]: This fund, this one is the one that didn't
happen because they said this money right
[SPEAKER_02]: here specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who was the one was like, yeah,
cut the kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cut the kids out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in the council was like, I got a good
idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't even aimed to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just this rule was set up to help
them have enough herb for when the shops
[SPEAKER_02]: opened.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was also, they said, when this
money's made, it's going to the schools,
[SPEAKER_02]: but then it just didn't get made.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody was really like, fuck that fund,
fuck those kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's $2.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody was really like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just how it worked out that they
found a way around that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I told you... It would be nice if they
were like, all right, we cut we were
[SPEAKER_02]: expecting maybe $100 million for the first
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just said, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have the best schools anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, just take this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next year's us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll divvy it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: Drop that common core shit and get on with
your fucking lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell the rest of the country that you were
the high ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of agree that they should change
the rule by 2016.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the shops are doing it right,
they don't need to move herb around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're growing medical herb,
it needs to be there for the patients.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they didn't really purposely screw the
kids out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just how... If I told you,
if you drive around the block every day on
[SPEAKER_02]: your work, you don't have to pay the $3
toll fee.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that $3 toll fee goes to the school
kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd still drive around the block.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't give a shit about that $3.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of what they did.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just drove around the block.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't go take the three bucks and
stab somebody for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just skipped paying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of this whole taking medical and
taking it recreational, I went out to the
[SPEAKER_02]: shop the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't say which one, but it was for
their special.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was nothing on the medical side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, well, you can choose
from the recreational.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was literally four kinds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was all sativa heavy, 70%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows what they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure I know what shop you went
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've recently opened up another
location north of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have a friend who stopped there just
the other day and they were hopping and
[SPEAKER_02]: the place was full and had all kinds of
great shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what they've done is they've taken all
their product from their Pueblo West
[SPEAKER_02]: location.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's full.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, oh, maybe they're marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they did a whole shelf of chatter,
a whole bunch of new extracts and things
[SPEAKER_02]: like that, and all kinds of other stuff
except for Bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was their special day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was in there like 11 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the shops need to get it together,
in my opinion, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying that affected us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that affected us here locally.
[SPEAKER_02]: That affected me.
[SPEAKER_02]: The medical patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're on the medical side.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why that really sucks is because on the
medical side, the herb, is cheaper just to
[SPEAKER_02]: start.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's considered medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even, you know, I'm not going to
lie about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have it for not strangling my wife and
children.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't say that on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have it for stress relief.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the medical side, it's a little bit
cheaper to start with.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the recreational side, they charge you
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then on the recreational side,
they add a tax to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's just move the same product from
the recreational side, from the medical
[SPEAKER_02]: side, right over to the recreational side,
mark it up 10 bucks an eighth more,
[SPEAKER_02]: screw the medical patients out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: More than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: 15 bucks an eighth more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Half.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's half the price more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, just mark it up way high,
charge an extra tax for it, and then don't
[SPEAKER_02]: even care about the medical patients
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can a shop do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: How can a business owner do that and look
his patients, his customers in the eye?
[SPEAKER_02]: They give you priority over the rec
patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means the rec patients can just sit
out there and have red card patients come
[SPEAKER_02]: in, come in, come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they do, and they just sit there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you got, that's the only thing you
get though, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that red card priority.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they should take you into the red
card side and take care of you properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pablo, they won't let them open up the,
they already bought the location next to
[SPEAKER_02]: him, had it all worked out with the owner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the city came in and says,
hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we're doing banging business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's right there, you know,
perfect location.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, yeah, but you're not
spreading and more of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we got enough, there's 12 of them right
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: They put a stop to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure to the North, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll have to let me know, but I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to go to dinner tonight?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about a 45 minute drive from here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm one of the dankest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, can we please go?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fucking for real.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to work in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be able to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 11 o'clock at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: For guru crack, I'll go and I'll even
throw in 10 bucks on gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I think we're going to go eat at this
place in Manitou Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grab up fucking her and let's go.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Mate Factor in Colorado Springs is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go there and spend money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Manitou Springs, the Mate Factor in
Manitou Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please go there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most amazing veggie wrap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get the veggie wrap with the house
dressing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, get the cheese sandwich.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the cheese sandwich.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want something cool, get the veggie
wrap.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want something hot, get that cheese
deluxe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember what was in my coffee?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I don't drink the coffee.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, but it was something weird and
fancy and I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jasmine maybe?
[SPEAKER_02]: The Dark Roast Mate is amazing if you're
going to drink something from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a nice coffee from there and it was
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyways, plug.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's just wrap up the show and
we're going to go to Manitou Springs and
[SPEAKER_02]: eat at the Mate Factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good talking to you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got one more news article.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did it go?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have two on the screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them is really long.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been going 35 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel my throat getting a little itchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to do one article and then
really possibly drive to Manitou.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see what our friend is doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to the person that introduced me
to the Mate Factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love you for that.
All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's another news article.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one was sent to me by our good
friend, Mike, who was laid out tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike hurt his back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike's a big dude to have a hurt back.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's got to suck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish you were here doing dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dabs would help you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said he couldn't even get in his car.
[SPEAKER_02]: It probably wouldn't if he hurt his back
because the lung thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he coughs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike, you like to cough, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys smoke cigarettes and take dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You choke so hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to quit that, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cigarettes are the devil.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can smoke all the weed we want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you smoking cigarettes?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not your dad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So prosecutors object to war on weed is
the title of this article.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking for someone who wrote it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the author?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that mine or yours?
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris Wiegandt.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was from Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one that Mike sent us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm dabbed out too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Show on the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keeping the show on the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prosecutors object to war on weed by Chris
Wiegandt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably said that wrong, but that's how
I do stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Technical glitch there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like I cut out for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, where was I?
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris Wiegandt.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The prosecution objects.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one way to put it at any rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two news stories from the Pacific
Northwest today pose an interesting
[SPEAKER_02]: question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are prosecutors beginning to get fed up
with the war on weed?
[SPEAKER_02]: The two stories are completely unrelated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should mention.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is about a current prosecutor at the
local level, and one is about a former
[SPEAKER_02]: federal prosecutor making a noteworthy
endorsement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Neither has anything to do with the other,
but both show some common sense being
[SPEAKER_02]: applied in refreshing ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too early to call it a trend,
even a regional one, but it certainly is a
[SPEAKER_02]: step in the right direction at the very
least.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first, the local story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seattle's elected, geez.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seattle's elected prosecutor said Monday
he's dropping all tickets issued for the
[SPEAKER_02]: public use of marijuana through the first
seven months of this year because most of
[SPEAKER_02]: them were issued by a single officer who
disagrees with the legal pot law.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a briefing to city council on Monday,
city attorney Pete Holmes says he is
[SPEAKER_02]: moving to dismiss approximately 100
tickets issued by the Seattle police
[SPEAKER_02]: department between January 1st and July
31st.
[SPEAKER_02]: His office also said it would be seeking a
refund for 22 people who have already paid
[SPEAKER_02]: their $27 ticket.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one state to the south, a former
federal prosecutor for Oregon,
[SPEAKER_02]: has thrown her support behind a ballot
initiative to legalize recreational
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana for adults in the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris Olsen, who served as Oregon's chief
federal prosecutor during the Clinton
[SPEAKER_02]: administration, made the news by joining
House member Earl Blamenhauer and a former
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon Supreme Court justice by publicly
supporting the ballot measure,
[SPEAKER_02]: and here's the story.
[SPEAKER_02]: I enforce our marijuana laws, but they
don't work, Olsen said in a statement
[SPEAKER_02]: announcing her endorsement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Filling our courts and jails has failed to
reduce marijuana use, and drug cartels are
[SPEAKER_02]: pocketing all the profits, she said,
citing federal statistics that show about
[SPEAKER_02]: one in 14 Oregon arrests is for marijuana
possession.
[SPEAKER_02]: Real quick here, you know, we're not,
the government here in Colorado is not
[SPEAKER_02]: bitching about the cartel really any much
anymore running pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they're starting to look at like you
guys, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the guys who take care of patients,
they're like, hold on, they're not just,
[SPEAKER_02]: we don't have control over everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what it's become.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even a crime anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now they're starting to turn into well,
we're making tons of money, but how can we
[SPEAKER_02]: get just a little more each year,
a little more each year?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no worry of cartels anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: The old guys around here, a lot of the old
timers don't like to pay kind bud prices.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get, if you know the right people,
you can get an eighth of dank weed around
[SPEAKER_02]: here for 25 bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the day, those guys used to buy
that Mexican brick weed for $25 a half
[SPEAKER_02]: ounce, and they love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They only smoke a bowl a day, two bowls a
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some kind bud would just kill them,
you know, two hits and they'd just be
[SPEAKER_02]: retarded.
[SPEAKER_02]: But lately those guys are calling up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the guys I used to talk to years ago,
they're like, hey man, can you get any
[SPEAKER_02]: decent weed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they can't find any of their old
swag connects anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that shit is gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: That cartel Mexican import weed is
disappearing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hook them up with that high CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got a first story here, and this is
my interjection here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not into the article right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first story here is about a prosecutor
saying that he's going to drop tickets
[SPEAKER_02]: written by a cop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that cop's a dick and did this out
of his own.
[SPEAKER_02]: You reported on this on an earlier
episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck that cop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take a dollar for that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have another person saying the
laws don't work and they state that they
[SPEAKER_02]: actually, the drug cartels are profiting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it looks like some people are starting
to understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people are starting to see the light.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are positive reasons why we want to
legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll get back into the article.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the first instance, this was nothing
short of a prosecutor using his
[SPEAKER_02]: prosecutorial discretion to avoid wasting
a lot of time in the courts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And more importantly, to rein in one
police officer who was obviously on a
[SPEAKER_02]: vendetta against the voters for passing a
law he did not personally approve of.
[SPEAKER_02]: One single police officer was responsible
for eight out of all 10 tickets issued in
[SPEAKER_02]: Seattle for public consumption of
marijuana during the first half of this
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other 20% were written by the entire
rest of the police force.
[SPEAKER_02]: To put this in another way, this officer
on one ticket wrote he considered the new
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization law silly.
[SPEAKER_02]: While the officer has been reassigned to
new duties, after this came to light,
[SPEAKER_02]: there are a lot of folks with cases still
in the legal system as a result of his
[SPEAKER_02]: actions.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a dick of a cop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cops don't realize what they're doing to
you when they screw you up for having a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit of weed or whatever you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them do and they love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on guys, if you're a cop,
some cops are listening to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're a law enforcement officer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to educate you about how not
dangerous cannabis is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that... Ask us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, especially if it's here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just listen to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just listen to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys will learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Inform yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a smart dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an educated dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm reading news.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to educate people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to keep people safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not bad people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you not just hear stoners with words
right there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoke's pot, not a bad person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Washington state, of course,
recreational marijuana use is legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: The voters approve the change in state law
and the prosecutor's actions quite
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously reflect the will of the people.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it didn't have to happen this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prosecutors in general are pretty much
tough on crime types of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if this particular prosecutor has
agreed with the cop's way of thinking,
[SPEAKER_02]: then all these cases would have continued
to clog the legal system all the way to
[SPEAKER_02]: the bitter end, all $27 of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This prosecutor, however, objected to that
scenario and applied some common sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's even going the extra mile and trying
to refund fines already paid.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is truly commendable.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a truly commendable action.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, reflecting the will of the
voters in legal reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second news item doesn't seem to deal
with actual legal cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes from a prosecutor who no longer
works for the federal Department of
[SPEAKER_02]: Justice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still, this is a stunning development.
[SPEAKER_02]: Federal prosecutors, after all,
are not bound by any state law and
[SPEAKER_02]: therefore can apply federal law,
whether marijuana is still the most
[SPEAKER_02]: illegal of all drugs, aware marijuana is
still the most illegal of all drugs,
[SPEAKER_02]: without even having to weigh in on state
politics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Believe it or not, there are some
extremely zealous federal prosecutors all
[SPEAKER_02]: up and down the West Coast who are
fighting tooth and nail against any state
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization efforts in unprecedented and
creative ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hearing even a former prosecutor
bluntly refute the entire purpose of the
[SPEAKER_02]: federal war on weed is a welcome
development indeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: The language she used is a pretty strong
condemnation of federal laws she upheld
[SPEAKER_02]: while in office.
[SPEAKER_02]: I enforced our marijuana laws and they
don't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prosecutors are practical people who deal
with the real end aftermath of arresting
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana users.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the argument used is not a moral one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Locking up marijuana users is wrong or one
of racial equality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Black and brown people are treated
differently by the court system or even a
[SPEAKER_02]: political one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The public's mood has shifted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, it's a view from the front lines
of the drug war, which relies on personal
[SPEAKER_02]: experience in applying federal laws and
the relative effectiveness of carrying out
[SPEAKER_02]: this job.
[SPEAKER_02]: I enforced our marijuana laws and they
don't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this person, instead of just playing by
the book, basically saying, had weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: go to jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had weed, go to jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had a lot of weed, go to prison.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're actually looking at what they're
doing to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was saying, they're saying,
you had some weed, you're a human.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's quit smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your shit together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go to prison forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go get butt raped.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're taking some compassion into this
finally.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just starting to hear the other
side of the story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all nine times out of 10 you
got to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're going to court and standing in
front of the judge, everybody just kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: pushes you behind your lawyer or public
pretender sitting there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they say you have your day,
but a lot of times they just ask you if
[SPEAKER_02]: you understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a yes or no question is all you
really get.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's good that they're finally starting
to be like, what did you have?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So of all the pro-legalization arguments,
this could perhaps be the strongest one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The laws don't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have the intended effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: The feds have been fighting the war on
weed for almost a century now with
[SPEAKER_02]: precious little to show for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, they have severe unintended
consequences.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drug cartels are pocketing all of the
profits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Therefore, mindlessly continuing on the
same course is nothing short of madness.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what they call insanity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris Olson is not the first law
enforcement officer to have this
[SPEAKER_02]: revelation and begin publicly trying to
change the situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: An entire organization already exists,
Law Enforcement Against Prohibition or
[SPEAKER_02]: LEAP, for members of the law enforcement
community past and present to advocate the
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana legal reform.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many members are former cops who saw
firsthand how pointless the entire war on
[SPEAKER_02]: weed truly was throughout their careers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now free to the prospect of ending their
career over a public statement,
[SPEAKER_02]: many are speaking out on the subject.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their message is a simple one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prohibition didn't work and prohibition of
marijuana isn't working either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris Olson is to be commended for raising
her own prosecutorial objection and for
[SPEAKER_02]: knowing her public support behind a ballot
measure in the state where she used to
[SPEAKER_02]: uphold the law.
[SPEAKER_02]: The personal connection to the state
ballot measure might convince a few
[SPEAKER_02]: voters, even tough on crime types.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, let me move this page.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all scrolling on its own.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where were we?
[SPEAKER_02]: All the rest of the arguments aside,
the law needs changing because it doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does nothing short of waste time for
the entire judicial system for something
[SPEAKER_02]: which shouldn't even be illegal in the
first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Oregon ballot measure race may be
close.
[SPEAKER_02]: The year Washington and Colorado legalized
recreational marijuana, Oregon had a
[SPEAKER_02]: similar, but badly written initiative on
its ballot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It failed.
[SPEAKER_02]: This time around, the effort is a lot more
serious, but reliable polling on the
[SPEAKER_02]: subject is notoriously hard to do,
so the vote might be very close in
[SPEAKER_02]: November.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, if you're in Oregon when this comes
up, go vote to legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, pro-legalization groups will be very
closely watching the vote this year in
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon and in Alaska.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll also be closely watching the
impact of Olson's simple, the laws don't
[SPEAKER_02]: work message.
[SPEAKER_02]: Olson's message is a powerful one because
it could reach voters not generally open
[SPEAKER_02]: to other pro-legalization arguments.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a law and order type of voter,
a former federal prosecutor's opinion
[SPEAKER_02]: should carry some weight, in other words.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps more prosecutors, both state and
federal, both current and former,
[SPEAKER_02]: can be enlisted in this movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I said, it is far too early to call
this any sort of trend, but it certainly
[SPEAKER_02]: is a development worth taking note of.
[SPEAKER_02]: To end on the legal theme we began on,
perhaps the voters will sustain these
[SPEAKER_02]: prosecutors' objections.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can follow Chris on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was written by Chris Weigant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's at Chris Weigant, W-E-I-G-A-N-T,
a very well written article.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you follow him on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for letting me read your stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, people are catching on, it looks
like.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's glad to see the people are just open
for debate.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and maybe like they said,
maybe now that- The state hasn't melted.
[SPEAKER_02]: The older people don't want to hear from
you and me that weed is harmless,
[SPEAKER_02]: that cannabis is helpful, that medical
marijuana will help you.
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't want to hear that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're a former, if you're a former
from the Fed, then they have to listen to
[SPEAKER_02]: you because you're obviously not full of
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, at least they should trust you
because you're the one been feeding them
[SPEAKER_02]: the shit for the past however many years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now what do we believe?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we believe all the bullshit that you
told us for many, many years or do we
[SPEAKER_02]: believe your new bullshit?
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as we start believing the new
bullshit from the person that used to be
[SPEAKER_02]: ex-military, then we're crazy right along
with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: They just label us as that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you guys heard the air
quotations, but they were there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, that's just crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope Oregon gets it going because they
got so much talent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've only seen from social media
and stuff like that, but I've seen people
[SPEAKER_02]: up that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right between two meccas.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't go wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be the perfect blend.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got many respectable people up there
