[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 541 of the Grow
From Your Heart Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joining me today is White Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're doing well, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope the audience is doing well.

delicious.

[SPEAKER_00]: I really fucked that ad up, but we're
going to keep rolling through it because
[SPEAKER_00]: it felt natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next order of business, Mike,
is to ask what you're smoking on.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you dabbing today, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a little assortment of apothecary
stuff, but what I've been hitting most is
[SPEAKER_01]: the Malibu Peer Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking is harder than it should be today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get it figured out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that Malibu Peer Kush from apothecary?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that Malibu Peer Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty tasty batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're all slow and mellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am over here dabbing the Guava Papaya
live batter from Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a blend of Chem 4 and Papaya.
[SPEAKER_00]: The package says sour, fuel, and soft
fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a sour, fruity candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about the fuel in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really get the fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, I agree, but sour,
fruity candies, almost like a sour patch
[SPEAKER_00]: with the powdery sugar on the outside
where it's real crispy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the crumbly sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of got that kind of a flavor,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guava Papaya live batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike is showing his package.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what I meant to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: The package of his concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's his concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's my concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys take a dab with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get too excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So audio listeners, that's a good segue,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were listening to the show on
audio, I invite you to come join us on
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been putting all of the shows up in a
video format on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see my smile and face.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see Mike's pasty semi smile and
face.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the concentrates we just
showed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join us on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Search for Girl From Your Heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click subscribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click that notification bell.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you can get a notification every
time a new episode comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check us out on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we have upgraded.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are on Spotify.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have moved the show to not move.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have added to Spotify.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a couple people ask if I'm going to
Joe Rogan them and if I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: disappear on other platforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we're going to Spotify also because a
lot of people only listen on Spotify.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to expand the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want everybody to be able to listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was silly to not have it on Spotify.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a technical glitch that was not
allowing my service to work with Spotify.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine comes from my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to make a correction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought of a very easy solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me a night of brainstorming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually took about six dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I went, oh, that's the fucking
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did it and everything seems to be
working.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are on Spotify from 500 on up is on
Spotify.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the episodes won't load into
Spotify.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not know why they have rejected them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The files are the correct files.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shows are good shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's copyrighted music
that I have selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why, but a few of them got
rejected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spotify simply won't accept them to the
feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't play.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I apologize if you're missing,
if you want Spotify, the solution is to
[SPEAKER_00]: come over to YouTube and check us out on
the YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you get to see Mike's smile and
face is looking at me like Mike or Jeff's
[SPEAKER_00]: just rambling right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to wait for that part to be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not checking it out,
no need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come hang out with us on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it's a more interactive
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are not going to leave any platforms
you guys, just because we're on Spotify
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't mean we're going away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to join us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless they offer us like a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care about our little weed
show, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they want to make me rich, I'll help
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll talk into selling out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get to getting rich in just
a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else was I going to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, speaking of Spotify, Spotify may be
rejecting some of my episodes because of
[SPEAKER_00]: copywritten music in the start and end of
certain shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, I will politely,
calmly, and very cordially request that if
[SPEAKER_00]: any of my friends out there make music,
if you're a producer, if you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: recorder, if you're an artist,
if you're into making beats, bro,
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a good opening track, maybe a
closing track for the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know I like reggae.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a reggae fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to play a song called the doggy
dub.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes in with a big fat beat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't fuck around something about 30
seconds, 45 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good old days, maybe a minute and a
half long, just some music.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could say, what's up guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this episode of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that good fancy shit seeds here now
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get all that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to make me some music,
if you are a professional and you require
[SPEAKER_00]: payment, send me a sample and if I like
your sample, I will pay you for the full
[SPEAKER_00]: track.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were, if you're just trying to do
something for out of the kindness of your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart, that's kind of what I'm looking
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still may get paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will definitely get a gift of some
sort in return.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to figure out where you are and what
you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will take good care of you.

[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of getting rich, big shout out to

[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it makes it, it's kind of fun when

[SPEAKER_00]: then people send you contributions for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, well, that's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I did something I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I helped people out and now they're
sending me some love in return for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's definitely very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: They help keep all the equipment running
smoothly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about all the gear that I've
got going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've bought, I replaced the MacBook with
Patreon contributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What time the MacBook started sparking and
making fucking smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I replaced it with Patreon
contributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what the Patreon money does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It pays for the web connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It pays for the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It covers quite a few things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, we've got a backup fund.
[SPEAKER_00]: In case anything goes wrong or we try to
do some upgrades.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really are helping out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next purchase here is going to get me out
of the void.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't like the black void behind
me, chip in.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't know what you mean until a
couple episodes away, but get Mike out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the void.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: We covered all the stuff, I think all the
important business stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon killed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is time to work into the email
portion of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say they did very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The folks did very well on my Patreon this
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're almost to another level.
[SPEAKER_00]: My number thinks, my brain thinks in
number levels and increments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, if we get to the next level,
I would consider another podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe at least one more every other week.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we could get it to the level I'm
thinking more content, more content,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would add another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have to focus less on other things
and I would just be able to free up some
[SPEAKER_00]: more time for more podcast content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we get up to that next level,
I may do another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mike was like, bro, what are you going
to do for another episode every week?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you going to come up with
content?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, have you seen the stack of
emails, Mike?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have got emails that people are
waiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm rambling today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took that dab of that guava papaya.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long fucking day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Truth be told, it is one in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, your dab crushed you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one in the morning and we're here
recording, but we're going to kill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to the email portion of the
podcast, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's help some people out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a stack of emails here in front
of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first email on today's episode goes
just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is from somebody who called themselves
iRevives and it says, Hail up Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for the great
information I received from listening to
[SPEAKER_00]: your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been growing everything from the late
seventies in my homeland in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just the holy herb, but the food that
I eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big respect for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my friends on the island
of Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the only difference is I grow
natural and no salts, but now that I have
[SPEAKER_00]: moved to the USA, I find it hard to do the
same because the soil is not the same
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we've kind of destroyed the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have any agricultural mindset
like in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Jamaica, they're thinking about the
future all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're thinking about right now and maybe
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the soil has been kind of tore up here
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all urban.
[SPEAKER_00]: So notice the soil is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't grow the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they decided to grow outdoor and use
cocoa and canna newts, but was not getting
[SPEAKER_00]: what I know the plant could produce while
I was growing in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I was on a mission to get information
from the top breeders and growers to see
[SPEAKER_00]: what they were using until I stumbled
across the DG C.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they found me on the dude grows show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where they mentioned Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So naturally, because I'm a fan of the
island of Jamaica, I had to browse your
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast and thank job for the blessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you found me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you are learning from the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's the part that we've got to
cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I have switched my nutrients from
what I was using.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said canna in a minute ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't going to say that, but I did say
the reason can I switch from canna and I
[SPEAKER_00]: am using veg bloom and my herb is on fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry for the long words, but job
bless.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did the episode on my nutrient mix
episode four or five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our listen for listener friend here,
switch their nutrients up to the veg
[SPEAKER_00]: bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did the mix that I said and other
herbs are on fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to send some thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where you are now,
but I do hope to get to sample some of
[SPEAKER_00]: that fire Rasta herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always love getting compliments and
getting feedback from the listeners,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially people who we improve their
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite part of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're helping people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to share that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our Rasta friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found this one on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a Patreon supporter and you've
got a question, go ahead and send those to
[SPEAKER_00]: me via Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know you are a Patreon contributor
and I'll try my best to get to those
[SPEAKER_00]: messages as soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget that right now we are
recorded ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a few episodes ahead of myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you feel like you sent me an email
today and I said I was going to read it on
[SPEAKER_00]: the show, we're ahead of ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't lying, but I knew that things
were going weird in the world and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: learning video recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we recorded ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got them in the bank, in the vault is
what we call it here in podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm ahead of myself in case I do get
sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: In case something goes wrong, I need a
week off to recover.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys won't miss content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Planning ahead, trying to be smart for you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, I'm fucking stoned and rambly today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be like a seven hour podcast
tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one comes from Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes from our friend Xavier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey, Rasta Jeff, thanks for being
an extremely positive force during these
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all face much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you for noticing that I try to
stay upbeat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I have a few questions
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently listened to episode 404 grow
lesson part four.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard you talk about shine a few times
and I have questions about the shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wondering what weeks of bloom you
recommend using shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shine is a product from a veg bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a product from they're called
hydroponic research is the name of the
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the product shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing in hydroponics,
if you're growing in a cocoa soilless mix,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think shine is a great product for
adding a bulk flavor, density,
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a really good bloom booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is kind of based on your plants and
your budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the availability of the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have a harder time getting it
based on their location.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is in the budget, start it early.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is not in the budget started a
little bit later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can afford to use it a week one
or week two, a flower do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is more cost effective for you to
wait two weeks started at week three,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm sure you want it in there by week
three, by day one of week three,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to start putting it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, you definitely need it by week
four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would use it all the way through the
bloom phase, especially the bulking weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: like five, six, seven, eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I stop using it around flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most cases, sometimes I'll use it for,
if I'm flushing for 14 days, I'll use the
[SPEAKER_00]: plus the shine, the shine for about a week
of that, because it's not going to build
[SPEAKER_00]: up in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to, it's going to, you're not
going to taste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to get stuck in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're flushing out most of the other
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still got seven days to flush that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'll really bulk up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use it early week two, if you can,
if you can use it a week one, use it a
[SPEAKER_00]: week one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't, I'm not saying you can't
afford it, but it's an expensive product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already bought a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you don't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week one's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week two is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week three, really get it in there by week
three, week four.
[SPEAKER_00]: You better have it by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't gotten it by week four,
you can still add it at five and six,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it would have been much better if you
did it earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when I would start adding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person says you can use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you use it to help stop the initial
stretch?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do use it early, use it before
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use it a few days before you go
into flower, it will help slow down the
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch that in a combination with popping
and twisting the branches that will
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely help slow down the stretch and
give you big fatter plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I also heard you mentioned some
kind of enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of enzyme would be good to add
at the end with my shine?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it says, I'm using advanced
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I need to use since is I'm as my
enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because you were using the advanced
nutrients product line does not mean you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to stick with their enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use whatever enzymes I'm product
is going to work with your nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: regimen, anything since he's I'm SLF 100
high resign.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any of that stuff is going to work for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing you have to pay attention to
mostly when you're mixing nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: companies is if you're using something
like a base or a Cal Mag or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you don't want to use a base
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's got a bunch of nitrogen that they
also put some phosphorus and potassium in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you use a bloom booster from
another company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the potassium and phosphorus,
but they also put nitrogen in there just
[SPEAKER_00]: because in their recipe, it would have
worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now you've got two different companies
with two different recipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had two different game plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quarterback threw the ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: They thought that in their game plan that
the fucking runner who's the, who catches
[SPEAKER_00]: it, the fucking catcher was his name,
the wide receiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: They thought that dude was going to go out
and left, but he's using a different
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went out and right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nobody caught the ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you got fucking a drop ball and you
don't want to drop balls when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just think about if you're using two
different companies, that's when you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to pay attention to blending products and
product wines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're just excuse the throat,
you guys, I'm talking about those dabs
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using just enzymes, I think any
enzyme will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like SLF 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hygrozyme is a great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Syncyzyme is an okay product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using the advanced and you want
to stick with a brand specific line,
[SPEAKER_00]: go for it, but it is not necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said what enzyme would be good to add
any of those would work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very good idea to add those enzymes
at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps clean stuff up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps break down anything that may be
left in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll repeat the three again, SLF 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pricey, but it's a good product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hygrozyme, it's pricey, but it's a good
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're using advanced nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That syncyzyme is probably the most
expensive enzyme out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are three that are readily
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canizyme is available.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of great enzymatic
products out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the one that fits your budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may look really expensive when you go
to buy the bottle, but it may say use one
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliter per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're using one mil per gallon,
as opposed to something that takes 10 mils
[SPEAKER_00]: per gallon, you have to do the cost
effectiveness of the milliliter cost per
[SPEAKER_00]: mil in that container at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get sticker shock because one is
super expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you only use one mil, that half of
whatever is going to last you a long,
[SPEAKER_00]: long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have to use 10 mils of it,
it's going to go much more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may be paying more right up front,
but it's going to last you a lot longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Xavier, I think I helped you
out with that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I gave you a good answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about how much shine to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably a good thing to recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start off lightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to go early, just do one
gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to go before a flower or
week one or two a flower, start off with
[SPEAKER_00]: one gram per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: One gram per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then yeah, per whatever, per can of
Mountain Dew.
[SPEAKER_01]: One gram per nostril.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, don't say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are wondering what kind of show
we've got now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't snort the shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get all kinds of trichomes,
but one gram of shine per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then at week two, increase it to two and
stick with that until week four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then slowly increase it as needed if you
want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can stick with two grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get all the way up to more than
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to give you numbers because
you guys are going to fuck your plants up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the tips of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the tips of the leaves get a little
brown, a little bit yellow, that's as much
[SPEAKER_00]: as they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go any more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're pushing them as hard as they need
to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're starting to get their nails done.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're about to burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start off with one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slowly work your way up to two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe work your way up to three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work your way up to three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention what the plants do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're really happy with what they're
doing, maybe try a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go much past three and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get fucking sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get angry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll cook up on you, but increase it
slowly and pay attention to what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in cocoa, you've really got a
lot of opportunity to increase slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in soilless mix, you got to just
water as you can, but pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start off with one gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work your way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go more than three and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys at VegBloom are going to email me
and say three and a half fucking grams,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go, yeah, it was fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: That weed was so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everything else has to be in line
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't be overloading anything else or
under loading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else has to be in line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just think I'm going to throw
three and a half grams of shine in here
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's going to be the magic bullet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's everything else has to be in line for
that shine to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like building a bodybuilder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got chicken legs, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm six foot five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I weigh like 190 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got fucking chicken legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not ashamed of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could go do leg day every day,
bro, and I'm just going to get more
[SPEAKER_00]: chicken.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be like if you took my chicken legs
and put Brock Lesnar's shoulders on there
[SPEAKER_00]: and he told him, go ahead and lift all
that weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a bench press.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need my legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some kind of standing lift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lift all that weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: My legs are going to crumble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you just have a shitty plant and you
think you're just going to go feeding it a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of shine, it's not prepared for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be able to take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got chicken legs, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to work the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything has to be in harmony for it all
to work beautifully like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look like you had something to say,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just try to plan your new feeds out from
the start so that you're not rushing to
[SPEAKER_01]: add shit in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where people get into trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget that people don't plan ahead very
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were on week six, you should know
what you're feeding all the way up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: day you flush and you should know the day
you flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I put a crop into flower,
I've got a general idea of what day it's
[SPEAKER_00]: coming down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be my first run with the plant,
but I know it's either going to take nine
[SPEAKER_00]: or 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've chosen that I'm going to give it nine
or 10 weeks and then I'm going to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to it and I'm going to cut it
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that week eight, I need to
flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already know what I'm going to feed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week one, two, three.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the recipe figured out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest thing with really good
cannabis is a plan and sticking to a plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: When people start changing shit in the
middle or trying new shit in the middle or
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to start that nutrient this week,
but I didn't have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to start it next week and
next week becomes two weeks down the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're telling people,
I want to start to shine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I start the shine on week two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I meant to get it out by week two,
but I missed week two and then week three
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of got away from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started it kind of end of week four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you say that shine wasn't the
product you expected because you didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: get it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You missed two and a half weeks worth of
shine opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not just newts either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've talked to people that are,
they got to their harvest moment and they
[SPEAKER_01]: went to grab the plant cutters and bolt
cutters to chop their plant down and
[SPEAKER_01]: thought, where am I going to hang this
girl?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and now they're scrambling and hanging
clothesline and it gets weird just cause
[SPEAKER_01]: they didn't plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden they're, they're a
quality cannabis is a C minus because they
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't plan out one step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause Amazon took an extra week because
they didn't deliver something that they
[SPEAKER_00]: should have ordered during week two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you guys know you're growing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're going to have a harvest
in a few weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start thinking ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good idea, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have all of your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in veg and you're going to
flower next week, order your flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, get them here, go to the store
and buy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're waiting on Amazon, if you're
waiting on something, go get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are super weird in the world right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting a lot harder to do that right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the planning becomes even more and more
vital.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things are going to start running out
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've done an episode before on being
prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave the grow stores alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to avoid all the pandemic and
COVID and weird talk, but leave the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: stores alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Mike, let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm high and rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so are you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could really get far off the rails
tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got another, yeah, those are our
friends, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, this, what is it called?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an email, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This email comes from somebody who calls
themselves Edward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes, Hey Rasta Jeff, what's up
Edward?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes, I just heard episode five 35 and
I cannot wait anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be one of the best shows in
podcast land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just noticed that every email I read
starts off with the people thanking me and
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, I'm the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't pick the emails that say that they
all say that it's not a selection thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how they start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that, but it looks like I'm picking
them based on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trust me or please trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, if anything,
I can't talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't stop talking about your current
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were making the listeners in
prohibition land sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they said, don't stop talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they said, do stop talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anything, stop talking about your
current flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're upset and sad that we're over here
smoking the guava papayas and telling them
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to check in on places like Reddit
and check out what people are smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: around the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every now and then I see something
that's just like, Oh my God, I haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: seen that since high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scotty real has a little bit of brickweed
on his shelf behind him in the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny just to see the brickweed
sometimes like, Hey bro, I want to smoke a
[SPEAKER_00]: joint and he's playing with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, Oh no, dude, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our friend Edward says, seriously,
I love the show and I did my best with my
[SPEAKER_00]: monthly contributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will have to associate the name and the
email with the Patreon so I can see what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're contributing and send you a special
thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say my questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some new seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have reached about five inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the top four leaves have appeared and
they are falling over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got, that's about four inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm picturing GI Joe.
[SPEAKER_00]: GI Joe is like three and a half,
three and three quarters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're about five inches and only the
top four leaves have appeared and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they fall over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it says, why?
[SPEAKER_00]: I put some toothpicks next to them,
but they are not strong enough to support
[SPEAKER_00]: the weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: What should I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what we call getting leggy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're stretchy and leggy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to put some popsicle
sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to put pens in there to
keep them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, that may be what you have to do
at this point, but that's not the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: What should I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants want a little bit light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want a little, I was going to say
want a little bit more of everything
[SPEAKER_00]: except water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want more air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need a little bit of wind on them,
but I think they're reaching for the
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably got them under a low
quality light, a low power light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly not the correct spectrum light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going, Hey, the main thing I
want out of life right now is light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it might be up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to keep growing until I
get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not going to get to it because
the light is not the right light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you need a little bit of wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of wind will prevent them
from getting so stretchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go fucking breaking them and
destroying them, but a little wind makes
[SPEAKER_00]: them kind of struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they kind of think about Mike,
what's the first thing you do if I were
[SPEAKER_00]: just to shove you, punch me back,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Rock back a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You spread your feet to get your balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get pushed, you spread your feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you blow on the plant,
it's going to get rattled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to spread its roots to try to
hold itself up and get stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then it might punch you back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Picking up the stock a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strengthen up that so that it can hold the
set up a little harder and reach for the
[SPEAKER_01]: stars where it wants to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to assume it's been
overwatered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you're probably overwatering.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not getting enough light,
it's not growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not doing anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably a little bit overwatered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is probably because it is not in
the appropriate soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need some aerated soil for a ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about lights, air, water,
and soil and make sure that all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: are correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it sounds like light is probably the
main culprit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put some more light on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should keep it a little bit tighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed if you listen to the previous
episode, when I switched to the LEDs,
[SPEAKER_00]: my growth went crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a huge testament to different
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went from T5s to LEDs and saw double the
growth really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the light is probably the culprit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it goes on to say, have you helped
anyone with an aquaponics system?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many YouTube videos and write
ups out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no one gives a real concise answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know your thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have built one with love, and I would
love to share my progress with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I do not grow aquaponically,
but I do know a guy named Aquaponics
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve, and he's got a podcast called
Growing with Fishes, and they specialize
[SPEAKER_00]: in growing with fishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think PotentPonics Steve is the way
to find him on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the podcast is called Growing with
Fishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what you should look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, check out the Dude Grows show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not be about aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you like my show, and you're
growing aquaponics, Steve Dredd from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing with Fishes show is also a good
friend with the Embracing Organics crew
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Dude Grows crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you check out the Dude Grows
crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you'll enjoy that show or the Dude
Grows show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on wherever you're listening to
podcasts, the Dude Grows show is on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're hearing my show, you can find
that show there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Embracing Organics also, that is on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: They talk about organically growing,
we talk about cultivation and all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to learn more about
growing, Growing with Fishes, it may be
[SPEAKER_00]: called PotentPonics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing with Fishes will get you to the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dude Grows show and Embracing Organics
are both great avenues to expand your
[SPEAKER_00]: aquaponic and organic cultivation
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boy, Mike, we should dab something
different on the next episode because that
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking papaya guava shit got me stuttery
and weird today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going with the last email, a lot of people
when they're first starting to get into
[SPEAKER_01]: growing, they say, I want to start growing
herb and I want to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a very difficult way to
grow that comes after that, either with
[SPEAKER_01]: fish or in a column or with- Going to
steal a train car and bury it eight feet
[SPEAKER_00]: underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water sprayers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, aeroponically?
[SPEAKER_01]: Aeroponically, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow underground and train.
[SPEAKER_01]: Train cars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, honestly, if it's your first
couple of grows, just focus on getting
[SPEAKER_01]: good growing in your space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good at managing the environmental
controls of your space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's like half the battle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like not to steal from the Joes or
anything, but it really is half the
[SPEAKER_01]: battle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get your space dialed in and learning how
to manipulate it successfully for what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn the gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn basically the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn what light cycles do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what happens when I trim a plant
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn the basics of plant growth,
the cycles, the nutritive cycles,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then learn how to make all of that
happen with fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if that's really the way you want to
jump in, I'm no one to sway you from
[SPEAKER_00]: living the fucking dream, but it is really
a challenging way to jump in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen some really beautiful in theory
setups that they use fish, but they all
[SPEAKER_01]: scare the shit out of me because fish plus
an environment that's good for fish plus
[SPEAKER_01]: water pumps and hoses in my brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of clogged hoses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just keep picturing Brian cleaning out
the little sprayer nozzles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The facility you know I'm talking about
and just instead of that stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's fish shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just what I picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a clogged sprayer nozzles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went from being cultivators to working
at fucking SeaWorld.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck SeaWorld, but anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more that it's... God, I'm so fucking
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I trying to say?
[SPEAKER_01]: You tell me, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Environmentally sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growing is killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you can keep us thriving,
grow, going based on a fish pond,
[SPEAKER_01]: like by all means do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you get to take care of fishies and
you probably get to name the tilapia that
[SPEAKER_00]: are swimming around or whatever,
but that's, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole new ball game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish food is way fucking cheaper than
bottled newts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that for a fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe what do you feel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you got to think about that fish
food is going to turn into fish poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to turn into the nutritive
cycle.
So you don't have to worry about that.
I think it's just going to take a while to
get to that point.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my experience for my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I may totally change up my fish food
diet at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may get caviar or steaks and whatever
they want at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I highly doubt it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode or this fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep calling this email and episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Geez, how high are we going to get?
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode is brought to you by
TooMuchHash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of Two Guys Coughing is
brought to you by yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: SeedsHereNow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email says to try to do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm a new grower and I want to use
aquaponics to support my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be good to talk soon from your friend,
Edward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Edward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we did not discourage you from
aquaponic growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a lot of extra work,
but if that's your passion, follow your
[SPEAKER_00]: dream, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just an extra learning step, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: By all means dive in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say just get the book first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely talk to aquaponic Steve,
Steve Rasner, Steve Dredd.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a lot of names.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's awesome dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got dreadlocks down to his ass,
a big old fuzzy beard.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been on the dude grow show.
[SPEAKER_00]: He hangs out at all the dude grows
parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust him, respect him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he will steer you in the right
direction and I think you'd enjoy his
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out Steve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're listening brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're well also.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody else out there has a question,
we'd love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, I've got one more email here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do four in this episode
just because one was super quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, Hey, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope things are going well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is, I don't know if they want
their name said in there, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to skip it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we met briefly at the Endo Expo this
year and I grabbed some double dragon
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I remember meeting you and I'm
glad that you got some double dragon
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to seeing you at the next
Endo Expo, whenever that may be in these
[SPEAKER_00]: weird times in which we live now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a weedy van.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zoom Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop it, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I recently saw an
Instagram post of yours where you posted
[SPEAKER_00]: your reverse spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I posted a big liter of silver
thiosulfate that I had freshly mixed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I've been working with SDS spray
for some months now and I've always been
[SPEAKER_00]: under the impression that it should come
out clear after it is mixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your Instagram post, it appears
slightly colored.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use or do you use a surfactant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think this is what happens when
we use expired product because that has
[SPEAKER_00]: happened to me before?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is the color of your spray normal as it
comes out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for taking your time to read this
and smoke a fat dab for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I've got a fat dab on the dabber so
that as soon as this show ends,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll hit this dab for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is going to be dedicated to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know the picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're going to do it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know the Instagram post you're
speaking of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made that jar of silver thiosulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shook it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I diluted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I applied it to some plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: The silver thiosulfate solution in that
jar is quite clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's not clear is the wall behind me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took that photo in front of this wall
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is sort of an off-white color.
[SPEAKER_00]: That came through in the photo,
so it looks like the photo, the solution-
[SPEAKER_01]: You have some dabbed out eggshell paint
behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's off-white, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from Supreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's off-white.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm just fucking around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not pure white.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is eggshell-y back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been too much dab smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made the solution look like it did have
some color to it, but no, it is completely
[SPEAKER_00]: clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you may see little flakes in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that your stuff didn't
dissolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have dissolved it, shook it up
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably shake it more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll break up in there, but it should be
clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it turns dark colors when you're mixing
it, that means that your solution has
[SPEAKER_00]: probably been exposed to too much light or
that there's moisture or something went
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong in either the silver or the sodium
powders is what that probably means.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the companies has stopped sending
me fine, fine powder, and they sent me
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger chunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those chunks don't dissolve very well,
and sometimes I do see colored particles
[SPEAKER_00]: floating around.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've begun to do is I put those
chunks in a baggie, and I wrap that baggie
[SPEAKER_00]: in newspaper, and I crush it with a hammer
to make those chunks smaller, and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: get that problem anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: The solution works better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little tip for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're buying from the same company as
myself and they've started sending you the
[SPEAKER_00]: pellets instead of the powder,
crush the pellets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to crush down their big
crystals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think they're doing you favors by
sending you the big buds, and we just want
[SPEAKER_00]: the shake.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I do not use a surfactant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I soak the shit out of the plant to the
point of runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't only spray the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make it a point to spray the branch of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main meristem, the main branch of the
plant also gets sprayed with silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is everything that we need to
cover on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spray was clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't use a surfactant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got colors, probably
contaminants.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say that again, Mike?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, easy question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you asked because that means
you're paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff was clear, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just the wall behind me.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you read the question, I smiled
because I was hoping personally that it
[SPEAKER_01]: was like an Instagram filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, no, that's just opaque,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the wall behind me needs a little bit
of repaint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even better answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was either the lighting or the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something gave it some color, but it is
clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is completely clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be happy to know that all of that
thiosulfate has been applied to a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that female looks totally like a male
and it is about to produce pollen here in
[SPEAKER_00]: the next five to seven days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should have a nice big tray of pollen
to play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Mike, I think we've been going
for a little over 30 minutes, maybe,
[SPEAKER_00]: unless we make an edit or two here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've got enough content to call
it a quality podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy podcast, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I'm not fucking baked out of my
brain, the show is over and I feel like I
[SPEAKER_00]: could do a podcast now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just downshift into reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I landed in the middle of that
show somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's fix that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're definitely going to fix that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I do the catchphrase,
we will take some dabs together.
[SPEAKER_01]: One little banger.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll brighten up your day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just one, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I got to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know a movie that's from,
high five and fucking shout out,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're cooler than shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That weasel stole the bee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking know, Tom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, do you have anything to add at the
end of this show?
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we start doing all the business
parts again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say that Jeff knows how to
carve and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not exhale.

[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, no skipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may fall down if I skip, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so high.
