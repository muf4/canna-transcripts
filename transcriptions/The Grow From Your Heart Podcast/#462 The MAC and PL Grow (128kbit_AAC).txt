[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[SPEAKER_02]: smokers and growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is time for episode 462 of the Grow
From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by my friends at Seeds Here Now.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need new regular, feminized or auto
flower seeds in your garden, I highly
[SPEAKER_02]: recommend Seeds Here Now, and you can find
them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, I've been taking dabs, of Headtrip,
full spectrum extract from our friends at
[SPEAKER_02]: Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a blend of indigo diamond and
chocolate tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the package, the flavor is described as
lemon meringue, aftershave and mojito.
[SPEAKER_02]: The potency label says that this product
contains 71.35% THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk a little bit about the
Headtrip.
[SPEAKER_02]: This stuff tastes interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has got a really unique flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you hit it, there is a lemon candy
flavor that happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then on the edge, exhale, there is a
weird, yet desirable, funky, delicious,
[SPEAKER_02]: aftershave, tangy, mojito, lemon,
minty sort of a thing that sticks into
[SPEAKER_02]: your mouth that I have never experienced
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never seen a concentrate described as
aftershave in the flavor, but this one
[SPEAKER_02]: tastes like you were smoking a dab next to
your old man.
[SPEAKER_02]: This smells like grandpa was splashing on
some old man aftershave while you were
[SPEAKER_02]: taking a dab and you caught a whiff of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is really what this concentrate
tastes like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had a lot of perfumey concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had a lot of floral concentrates,
but I've never had anything with the
[SPEAKER_02]: aftershave turp profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: So big shout out to my friends at Green
Dot Labs for the delicious and unique
[SPEAKER_02]: turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let's talk about the buzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am obviously rambly, but I can't pay
attention to what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got me going a million miles an hour,
but I don't know what is happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a really great concentrate for
a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope this show comes out well.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this episode, I'm going to read a
couple of listener emails.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get there, I would like to do a

[SPEAKER_02]: screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did say that I have a couple of emails
to read.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get there, let's hang out for a
minute and talk about what is happening in
[SPEAKER_02]: my breeding room.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been a little while since I have
shared what is going on in my breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about my most current
breeding project.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have recently pollinated the mac.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a mac cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was given to me by a great friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the mac one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is caps cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not familiar with the mac,
it is time to do some research on the mac.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Miracle Alien Cookies is one of the
new hype strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been super popular for quite a
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: The seeds always sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Capulator sells a ton of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mac has developed quite a reputation.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mac has been spread around the country
to a lot of respected growers,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I ended up with the cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took a clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got it well rooted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put it in the breeding room and it has
been pollinated.
[SPEAKER_02]: By my stud, a rise male known as King
Solomon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the mac does have a reputation for not
taking pollen very well, for not being a
[SPEAKER_02]: good breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks at this time like my mac female
has received plenty of pollen and it is
[SPEAKER_02]: making quite a few nice chunky fat seeds
that I can see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And usually you can see the outer layer of
seeds and there is another complete layer
[SPEAKER_02]: of seeds inside the buds that aren't
visible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like I probably have plenty of
seeds for me to play with.
[SPEAKER_02]: This cross was not done with intentions
for commercial release.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did this as a project for myself to play
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see what the Arise and the mac
do together.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Arise is my stud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Arise has done very well for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has made a bunch of great progeny.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to see what happened when I
put it to the mac.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let's talk about the mac for a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do I want to breed to the mac?
[SPEAKER_02]: The mac is a tremendous plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes very good when you dry and cure
and smoke the buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets you a special kind of stoned buzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is a downside to the mac.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, the mac grows very,
very slowly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the slowest growing plant I have
ever worked with.
[SPEAKER_02]: It grows very slow in veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you put it in flower,
when you think it's going to do that 21
[SPEAKER_02]: day stretch, it doesn't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does not stretch.
[SPEAKER_02]: At all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just slowly transitions to flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, once it's in flower, it acts just
like any other plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't take off with robust crazy
growth, but it does start stacking on the
[SPEAKER_02]: buds properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks perfect once you get a couple of
weeks into flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the mac is a very slow growing plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The leaves have really odd mutated shapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see weird shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you feed the mac wrong one time,
it will be pissed off for a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to get the mac dialed in and
figured out the mac is a very advanced
[SPEAKER_02]: growers plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That thing is not for a beginner grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a new grower and you've got the
mac, I wish you the best of luck.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is going to piss you off for a couple
of runs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my intention was to pollinate the mac
with my prized Arise male to kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: increase the vigor of the mac.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to keep that mac flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mac has got that gassy sort of a it's
also got a fresh tennis ball, a fresh
[SPEAKER_02]: rubber sort of a smell to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got an earthy smell to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a lot of really savory,
gassy, earthy, lower note sort of smells
[SPEAKER_02]: to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Arise also has parents which carry
those traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm hoping to find a phenotype which
will closely represent the mac flavor and
[SPEAKER_02]: aroma and also carry the Arise potency and
vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are the traits I'm trying to find
in the perfect phenotype that comes from
[SPEAKER_02]: this cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one I hope for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is my goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is my intention.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to find a male.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to find a couple of females and
then I will begin other projects with that
[SPEAKER_02]: mac to Arise cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'll find a male out of there that
is very mac dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I can do some pollinating with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is all about what these seeds from this
first pollination do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to find out what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what I've created.
[SPEAKER_02]: I may have just made gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: I may have just made a bunch of shitty
useless mutant seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know until you grow them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to finish these seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're still quite a ways away from being
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to harvest the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to get the seeds out of the
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I've got to plant seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to let those seeds veg,
then flower, then they need to be
[SPEAKER_02]: harvested, then dried and cured and then
we need to smoke them and find out if what
[SPEAKER_02]: we have bred is worth the shit at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is quite a ways away before I've got
any input, any results on this project.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the time of recording, I'm about 30
days since pollination.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've probably got 20 to 30 more days
before I can even harvest the seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: then give it a few days to dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I always need a little while to get
the seeds out and then I need to time
[SPEAKER_02]: these seeds into my rotation so that I can
grow them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it will be quite a while before we see
what these seeds have even done.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wanted to share with you that I have
pollinated the mac.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does appear that the mac successfully
took plenty of pollen and I will have
[SPEAKER_02]: plenty of seeds for myself to play with
and start some new projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there are a couple of things I've
noticed about the mac.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are frustrated when growing the
mac.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jaren grows the mac like a champ.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a couple of other people that
have the mac dialed in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the time I see people having
frustration with the mac.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I have learned quite quickly is
that the mac does prefer a lower pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are used to keeping your garden
around 6'4", 6'5", in that area,
[SPEAKER_02]: you may want to drop it down to 6'2",
or 6'3", and the mac will be a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: happier in that condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have also found that the mac responds
very well to calmag.
[SPEAKER_02]: It likes a little bit more calmag than
most of the other plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now here is something that I have found
very interesting with the mac.
[SPEAKER_02]: The roots of the mac do not seem to go as
deep as my other plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mac is in the same size pot as all of
my other plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the plants in this room are in a
seven gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of those plants are filling the pot
with roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mac has got a really thick layer of
roots, very shallow in the top of the pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the roots do not appear to be going
down and around like most plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks more like they have made a rug or
a welcome mat in the first few inches of
[SPEAKER_02]: that pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have gone really wide all the way to
the edges of the pot and then they work
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves back and they have woven.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best way I can describe it is like a
little welcome mat that you put right in
[SPEAKER_02]: front of the door that you rub your feet
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks just like that in this pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the time we get roots that go down
and then they wrap around the outside of
[SPEAKER_02]: the pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: This top of this pot is completely filled
with roots and most of the bottom still
[SPEAKER_02]: has plenty of root space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it looks to me from my experience that
the mac has a preference of wider root
[SPEAKER_02]: space instead of a deeper root space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're working with the mac that may
be something that may help your grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe put it in a bed instead of a deep
pot that could improve your outcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now keep in mind I do not have a lot of
experience with the mac.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have not developed a very solid
relationship yet but I do have her in
[SPEAKER_02]: flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got one in another area.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've cut clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured out how to get the clones
rooted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got some very happy looking veg
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've also got a couple of pretty pissed
off looking veg plants because I am
[SPEAKER_02]: feeding them different things and trying
to figure out how they respond to
[SPEAKER_02]: different feeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just different treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again the most noticeable thing I see in
the mac is it seems to prefer a wider root
[SPEAKER_02]: space instead of a deeper root space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've got a wider pot as opposed to
a deeper pot that would be the way to go
[SPEAKER_02]: with the mac.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over time I have also learned to give the
mac longer wet and dry cycles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me try to explain that a little bit
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of my veg plants are in a three
gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I water all of them with approximately
three quarters of a gallon of water on
[SPEAKER_02]: Monday those plants will need the same
amount of water again on Wednesday and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything will be happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now if you've listened to my one through
five water tech podcast this description
[SPEAKER_02]: will make better sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I water most of my plants I will get
them to a four.
[SPEAKER_02]: Monday morning I will water them until
they are saturated to what I consider to
[SPEAKER_02]: be level four.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they will last all of Monday around
that level four.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll start drying out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tuesday we'll get to level three.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time I get to the plants Wednesday
morning they're just getting to level two
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's time to water them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I give them some water and they're good
Wednesday Thursday and Friday and then we
[SPEAKER_02]: repeat the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in most cases I will water my plants to
a four and let them cycle until they get
[SPEAKER_02]: to a two and they will show me that that
is what they want.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants will grow with vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll eat the nutrients I provide them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't see stagnant growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't see green leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't see nutrient deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't see any problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let's talk about the Mac.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have learned that if I water the Mac at
a level five and just soak the shit out of
[SPEAKER_02]: it to where you would be worried about
most plants you'd say bro that's too much
[SPEAKER_02]: water she's gonna die.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just water the shit out of it and that
plant really seems to love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I don't give that plant water again
until it's about a one and a half and it
[SPEAKER_02]: is just starting to get groopy and it says
hey bro if you don't water me pretty soon
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna look like shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I water that plant full on to level
five until I'm getting a bunch of runoff
[SPEAKER_02]: until my pot is soaked and heavy and
saturated and I don't have to water that
[SPEAKER_02]: plant for probably five or six more days
in that three gallon pot and it is
[SPEAKER_02]: completely happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Mac is a very unique plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took me a couple of weeks and a few
plants to figure out how to get her happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I have discovered is a lower pH a
little bit extra Cal Mag and a wider pot
[SPEAKER_02]: as opposed to a tall pot really seemed to
make the Mac plants happier than any other
[SPEAKER_02]: things I have tried.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now one of the things that inspired me to
really soak the plant was the fact that
[SPEAKER_02]: Jaren grows the Mac in hydro and it is
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought it likes a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what happens when I over water
this bitch and guess what she went nuts
[SPEAKER_02]: which is really weird because most of the
time a plant with OG Kush type of genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: in it they really do not like an over
watering.
[SPEAKER_02]: So any other OG Kush type of plant be very
careful with over watering that fucker
[SPEAKER_02]: because you may drown it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen more people kill a Kush plant by
over watering than under watering.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is something you're going to have
to learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll have to dial it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is very plant specific and the Mac is
a very good example of a plant we need to
[SPEAKER_02]: dial in and establish a relationship with
if we want her to reach her full
[SPEAKER_02]: potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many people are going to grow the Mac and
they're going to give up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to say it didn't give me
enough flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't give me good enough flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't do what I expected.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys go ahead and tap out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to take a few dedicated
passionate growers to spend a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: grows with her and learn exactly what she
needs and she will fucking shine for the
[SPEAKER_02]: growers who spend some time doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're looking for something that's
real easy that's just going to put out
[SPEAKER_02]: weight and trichomes and grow amazingly
for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Mac is not the one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you've got some time to dedicate
and pay attention and commit to a plant
[SPEAKER_02]: and really dial something in and grow high
quality connoisseur grade cannabis the Mac
[SPEAKER_02]: would be a fun cut for you to work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a long rant about the Mac.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even read that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm over here hyping up somebody else's
strain but I've been growing it for a
[SPEAKER_02]: minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've noticed a lot of people are growing
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are frustrated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't be doing the cannabis world a
service if I did not help you grow the Mac
[SPEAKER_02]: to its full potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: So big shout out to first of all big shout
out to Capulator for breeding the Mac.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to my buddy Jaren for kind
of sharing his grow style and some
[SPEAKER_02]: accidentally sharing some tips on growing
the Mac.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I also owe a shout out to the people
who have made sure I had the Mac in my
[SPEAKER_02]: garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two of my very good friends reached out to
me and gave me clones of the Mac.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to say their names on the
show because I know if I do everybody is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to go and ask them for a clone but
they know who they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know that I've got nothing but love
and respect for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So big fist bump.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when the seeds are ready they
definitely get a couple of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you give me a clone and I pollinate it
and I breed to it you get some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds that come out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is called karma.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's called looking out for one another.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just called being a good fucking
person.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about what else is in that
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I obviously pollinated the Mac and I'm
super excited about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also put the GMO in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: To be pollinated by the Mac.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people love the GMO.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people say the GMO is just hype.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lately I've been loving that savory garlic
mashed potato turp that the GMO puts out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I can grow something that smells
like garlic and mashed potatoes and
[SPEAKER_02]: deliciousness trust me I'm going to grow
it and I'm going to breed with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've recently pollinated the GMO with a
rise pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be a great cross in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have also pollinated the Dosey
Dough.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got the Mac.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got GMO and we've got Dosey Dough.
[SPEAKER_02]: All pollinated.
[SPEAKER_02]: All filled with seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Mac I do not plan to release.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Dosey Dough may be released depending
on how the testing goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The GMO may be released depending on how
that testing goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep your eyes open.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep your ears open.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will keep you updated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again those have at least 20 to 30 days to
finish flowering before I can even harvest
[SPEAKER_02]: the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's what's going on in my breeding
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just thought I would share.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of people enjoy the updates
and the insight into my grow space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I've got one more quick note to get to
before I jump into the email portion of
[SPEAKER_02]: the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one says lots of emails.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got an email recently from somebody who
says hey Rasta Jeff you keep asking for
[SPEAKER_02]: emails on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've emailed you two or three times and
you have not read my message on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically saying what the fuck is up with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have got a large stack of emails.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have probably got 25 printed emails here
in front of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm only going to read two or three of
them on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is nothing against you personally if I
do not read your email on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's only so much time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only have so much voice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only put out so many episodes.

[SPEAKER_02]: Don't feel discouraged.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I am working your email and
another person's email into the same show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it's on the schedule and it's
coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just got to be patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please do not take it personally.

[SPEAKER_02]: It is just timing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is subjective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe today I want to talk about turps and
your email is about microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I want to talk about microbes and
your emails about turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: It all just has to do with what I want to
talk about today.
[SPEAKER_02]: What other people are talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else is going on in my life or the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nothing personal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the luck of the draw.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just how the emails are stacked up in
my pile.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that being said please do not
stop sending the emails.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I get a great email question and I
really like it and it stands out it may
[SPEAKER_02]: just go first.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the beauty of having my own
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get to pick and choose which email goes
first.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right that's enough of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of all these emails let's get
right to these two emails that are here on
[SPEAKER_02]: top of my pile.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of weeks ago I talked about a
piece of equipment called the PL grow
[SPEAKER_02]: minder unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The PL grow minder unit is a device that
hangs in your grow room and it pays
[SPEAKER_02]: attention to the temperature and the
humidity and several other parameters in
[SPEAKER_02]: your grow room.
[SPEAKER_02]: It links up to your smartphone or other
wireless device and you are able to log in
[SPEAKER_02]: and view the conditions of your grow room
from anywhere on the planet as long as you
[SPEAKER_02]: have got internet access.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like the peace of mind of having
a grow room monitor in my grow room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can open up my phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can log into a website and I can see the
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see the humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see the VPD and I can also see the
temperature of my reservoir on one screen
[SPEAKER_02]: just by logging in to a quick website.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can find that information from anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I know that hey it's been hot today
I wonder if that air conditioner cycled on
[SPEAKER_02]: at noon like it's supposed to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can open up my phone and go bleep and
it'll show me yeah it's 74 degrees in the
[SPEAKER_02]: grow room.
[SPEAKER_02]: That air conditioner did cycle on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have to worry about anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can enjoy my day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really enjoy having a grow room
monitor just for peace of mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also does logging.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will keep days and weeks and months
worth of data backed up so you can look at
[SPEAKER_02]: a chart and see how is my humidity how is
my temperature for several days and it
[SPEAKER_02]: really helps you to identify and solve
problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: If something goes wrong you can say that
happened about two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully you were taking notes on what
you fed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can look at your feed.
[SPEAKER_02]: What did I feed two weeks ago?
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you can go back and you can look at
your VPD chart two weeks ago and you can
[SPEAKER_02]: say ah shit look right here we started
getting weird spikes and you can see right
[SPEAKER_02]: here we started getting weird dips and
those may have something to do with the
[SPEAKER_02]: problems in your grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really find it beneficial to have a
quality grow room monitor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now with all of the technology involved of
course somebody out there had to be
[SPEAKER_02]: paranoid about the technology involved in
the PL unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand every group of friends has
that one guy who is a paranoid conspiracy
[SPEAKER_02]: theorist and he's always welcome in my
group.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got an email from that member of the
group and it goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says good morning Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just listened to your grow from your
heart podcast which discussed the P&L grow
[SPEAKER_02]: system monitoring device.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about your listeners who don't live
in such cannabis friendly communities as
[SPEAKER_02]: yours?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the monitoring device safe?
[SPEAKER_02]: Will it record your location?
[SPEAKER_02]: I could just be old and paranoid but it
scares the hell out of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I checked out the website and the unit
looks fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: They say they're safe and they don't
record any info but what about third party
[SPEAKER_02]: listening in?
[SPEAKER_02]: The digital footprint is scary and I am
scared but thanks for all you do signed
[SPEAKER_02]: Willy's armpit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he did follow that up with the
second email.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just get right to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says good afternoon Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I emailed you this morning about using the
P&L monitoring system and my paranoia.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot to mention I'm also even too
paranoid to sign up for Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you guys have been listening to the
show you know that Cannabuzz is a cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: friendly social media application.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you check out Cannabuzz on your
Android or Apple device.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me a follow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm iry underscore genetics on Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to seeing you there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The email goes on to say will you please
tell me if I should get with the times
[SPEAKER_02]: drop the paranoia and join the party or
should I be afraid?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sending these emails even freaks me out
but I trust your opinion and truthfulness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks again from Willy's armpit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright there's a lot to unwrap there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Willy's armpit is paranoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's afraid to get in trouble by using the
P&L grow monitor unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's also afraid to get himself in trouble
by using the Cannabuzz social media
[SPEAKER_02]: application.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do understand being paranoid or
apprehensive to show off your grow on the
[SPEAKER_02]: internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about the Cannabuzz question
first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabuzz does not sell or trade or give
away any of your information.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do not save any of your information.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've spoken with Q about this a couple of
times.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's also been interviewed on a couple of
other shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do not want your information.
[SPEAKER_02]: They simply want you to be a part of the
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now if you are worried about posting your
cannabis material, your cannabis photos,
[SPEAKER_02]: there are ways to disguise your IP
address.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are applications you can download
for your phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: You download the application, you open
that application first, then you do all of
[SPEAKER_02]: your normal posting and browsing and it
makes it look like your phone is in
[SPEAKER_02]: another location.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are interested in posting to
Cannabuzz and you are still too paranoid,
[SPEAKER_02]: that is one suggestion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use a fake VPN.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is very affordable, it is very easy,
and it is very safe and effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you are in a prohibition state and
you'd like to participate in some social
[SPEAKER_02]: media and post your cannabis photos,
that is the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get an application, you can do the
same thing on your computer, you can do
[SPEAKER_02]: the same thing on your Android or iPhone.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get an application, you download that,
you go through that one first.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes all the other applications think
you're in Russia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that way if they say, well,
where is this guy posting these weed pics?
[SPEAKER_02]: It says you're in fucking Russia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody cares.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to go there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now my second thought around the Cannabuzz
paranoia is that unless you make a
[SPEAKER_02]: mistake, unless you do something stupid,
I don't think that they are looking to
[SPEAKER_02]: cause trouble and arrest people through
Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are many other avenues to find
criminals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you're doing some illegal
transactions or some kind of bullshit on
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabuzz, you should be safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Notice I said should.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am not a computer crimes or an internet
technologies expert in any way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I type with two fingers going peck,
peck, peck.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am not the guy to get computer advice
from, but I don't think they're worried
[SPEAKER_02]: about small time growers posting a couple
of plants on Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know your location.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know your demographic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know the rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how big of a deal it is where
you are, but I don't think Cannabuzz will
[SPEAKER_02]: be your downfall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, if you're super paranoid,
just don't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you really want to do it, get away to
mask your IP, then join us there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't put anything that would identify
your location or who you are in any of
[SPEAKER_02]: your photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to put plants in the
photos, put plants in the photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure that none of your identifying
personal documents or belongings or
[SPEAKER_02]: buildings or anything like that are behind
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay attention to what is in the background
of your photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you post a picture and it's got a
building in the background and it says
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever Denver city library, then we all
know that you live right by the Denver
[SPEAKER_02]: city library.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do shit like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep yourself safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be extra careful with your posts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let's move forward and talk about the
PL grow minder paranoia.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did reach out to my friends at PL grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, hey, I've got a friend who has
some questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who has some concerns and they sent me a
statement and it says we at PL grow
[SPEAKER_02]: systems take privacy seriously and we
respect the privacy of our customers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do not request or store any personal
identifiable information.
[SPEAKER_02]: All we do require is an email address and
a username.
[SPEAKER_02]: So users can log in and receive alerts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Information is stored encrypted and all
data that is transmitted to and stored in
[SPEAKER_02]: our secure cloud platform is anonymized.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clients sensor and journal data is not
sold to third parties.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use the data internally in our own
analytics to provide our clients with a
[SPEAKER_02]: high value service.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they actually give me an email
address.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please direct any questions you have on
this or related matters to info at PL grow
[SPEAKER_02]: dot systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they signed it from Pete and that
is the P from PNL grow system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you reach out to PNL, you will
probably get P or L responding to your
[SPEAKER_02]: email.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's touch on what they said here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just cover it real quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: They take privacy seriously and they
respect our privacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that they request is a username and an
email address.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody says you have to use your real name
for that username.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just make up a name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bottle of frosty cold Dr. Pepper could be
your username.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Pepper could be your login info.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be that easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can stay anonymous that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they also assure us that none of the
information is sold and that all of the
[SPEAKER_02]: information is only used to help improve
the PL grow system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it sounds like they have thought about
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are not interested in your
information, nor are they interested in
[SPEAKER_02]: gathering your information to sell it to a
third party.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also PL grow systems is in another
country.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that puts another layer of legal
protection.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they did, some government official did
want that information.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would have to get that information
from our friends in another country.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that actually provides another layer of
security there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I assure you that our friends at PL
grow do not want to steal or pirate your
[SPEAKER_02]: information.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will not be sold to anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also PNL grow systems does not keep
your location information for any reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know where you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only information that PL grow systems
has is your email address so they can send
[SPEAKER_02]: you notifications from your device.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got your login information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, so you can log in and they can
send you the information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the only other details they know are
the temperature, the VPD, the humidity of
[SPEAKER_02]: your grow room, and potentially the
temperature of the water in your reservoir
[SPEAKER_02]: if you are using the water temperature
sensor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the only things they will know
about you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the only things that they are
concerned with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, any information that they do
receive from your unit will only be used
[SPEAKER_02]: to improve the quality of the PL grow
monitoring system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So rest assured, you guys, they don't want
to steal your info.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have no use for your info.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to pass it on to a third
party.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use the equipment in confidence.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use it in multiple environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use it in my personal grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use it in caregiver grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use it in commercial facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have recommended it to several friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no fear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I'm using it, you should use it
with no fear.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was not supposed to be a Mac
commercial, nor was this supposed to be a
[SPEAKER_02]: PL grow minder unit commercial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of turned into both of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you guys enjoyed the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a great Thursday episode.

[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on a plane.

[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere I have heard this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: My memory is torn as it fails on who
learns me
[SPEAKER_01]: and the safe.

off lies that don't make sense.
