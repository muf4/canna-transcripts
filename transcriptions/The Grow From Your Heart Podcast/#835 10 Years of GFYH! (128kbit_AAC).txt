Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: welcome back podcast world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode 835 of the grow from your
heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got another fun episode lined up for
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: In today's episode, we're going to give
away free seeds, hang out, we'll talk more
[SPEAKER_01]: about those free seeds later on in the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to invite you once again to the
Dude Grows Growers Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, June 1st in Fort Collins,
Colorado, the Dude Grows crew was throwing

[SPEAKER_01]: special pricing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, I think that covers all of the
business part here at the start of the
[SPEAKER_01]: show that we need to get through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's jump into what is known as the pet
peeve section of today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes when I walk into a grow space,
it could be a friend's grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's just something I see at the
grow store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's something online.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something will just drive me crazy and a
grow that becomes a pet peeve.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your grow room pet peeves?
[SPEAKER_01]: Share them with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me an email at
growfromyourheartathotmail.com with the
[SPEAKER_01]: word pet peeve in the subject line.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I read your pet peeve here on the
podcast, that means that you do win a
[SPEAKER_01]: prize.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of peas in a row.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I read that pet peeve here on the
podcast, you do win a free prize.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will win a free pack of seeds off of
AiryDirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's first pet peeve actually came from
somebody called Frog Slayer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pet peeve is seeing people run a
humidifier and a dehumidifier at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: damn time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny that that's a pet peeve of
yours because honestly, bro, I do that
[SPEAKER_01]: shit all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here in Colorado where the
temperature, the humidity level,
[SPEAKER_01]: it changes drastically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the next couple of days, like two
days ago, I was wearing a jacket.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was snowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had my snowshoes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wearing a beanie, had a scarf.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was out in the cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super, super cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now today, it was 75 degrees out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was out there in joggers in a t-shirt
just loving the sunshine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here in Colorado, we get drastic,
drastic changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't risk having those changes outdoors
affect my indoor grow environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dry and cure spaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way to do that is put enough equipment
in there to keep those parameters the way
[SPEAKER_01]: you need them to keep that environment how
you need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I often talk about running the humidifier
and dehumidifier at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll set them both in a dry and cure
environment especially.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will set them both at 55%, 55% humidity,
55 degrees, 55 degrees in the room,
[SPEAKER_01]: 55% humidity on the humidifier,
55 on the dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let all three of those pieces just work it
out together.
[SPEAKER_01]: All day long.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got a humidifier, a dehumidifier,
and an air conditioner just banging it out
[SPEAKER_01]: all day, making sure the environment stays
the way that we need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I understand it's a pet peeve to some
people, but in Colorado, man, I've got to
[SPEAKER_01]: do what I have got to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't risk getting too hot or too cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't let it get too dry or too wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do have that opportunity,
like I said, because of the major swings
[SPEAKER_01]: in my environment here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had snow a couple of days ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have heat today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that in just a couple of days
because of these changes, we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get some rain or some sort of moisture,
just how the environment reacts here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then when that moisture comes,
that rain comes, my humidity will spike in
[SPEAKER_01]: my dry and cure room.
[SPEAKER_01]: That dehumidifier will help me out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I do get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It drives you crazy, but that's what I've
got to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes those weird things that you
see, there's actually a huge purpose for
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my friend Frog Slayer, thank you for
the great ramble.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got me going here on a good start on
this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big up and give it a try, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that humidifier dehumidifier combo
will give you some advantage, especially
[SPEAKER_01]: in that dry and cure area.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to keep moving because this next
message has me excited and puts a smile on
[SPEAKER_01]: my face.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came from the Grow Help tab on
iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to my website, iregenetics.com,
it is I-R-I-E, just in case I say it too
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly or if I mumbled through that or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I-R-I-E, that again is a Jamaican word.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a patois word.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means to feel the most blessed you
could feel, the most powerful you could
[SPEAKER_01]: feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I describe it as like the first time I
ever remember feeling iry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was sitting on a little hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a dog next to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sun was setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little bit of wind coming from
behind me.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a tree next to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for a minute there, everything just
felt fucking beautiful, just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just it was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: The grass was kind of, you know,
when you sit in the grass, it feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: it's comfortable, but the grass is
slightly cold and cool and it cools your
[SPEAKER_01]: butt and it cools your feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on a hot day, you sit in that cool,
grass in the shade, you got the sun on
[SPEAKER_01]: you, just watching the city, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was iry, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt just blessed and at peace and
perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what iry means.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why my company is iregenetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Powerful and pleasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just makes you feel real good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, so I'm rambling.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what ire means.
[SPEAKER_01]: The website is iregenetics.com,
I-R-I-E.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course the word genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you can spell that one by now.
[SPEAKER_01]: iregenetics.com is the website at the top
of iregenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a list of tabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those tabs does say grow help.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you click on that grow help tab,
we give you the opportunity to send me
[SPEAKER_01]: your grow question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, if I read your grow question
here on this podcast, you do want a coupon
[SPEAKER_01]: code for a free pack of seeds off of
ireadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is where the seeds are handled.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this one came from my new friend,
Eric.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Eric?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to meet you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It starts off with, hey man, hey man,
good to meet you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says much respect, big respect back at
you as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the message gets fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I was listening to a podcast and
March 28th is your anniversary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been 10 years now, if my math is
correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, we just had the 10 year
anniversary of the Grow From Your Heart
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast and I did not even notice or
acknowledge that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to have a listener send me an email
letting me know that this podcast has been
[SPEAKER_01]: going for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is wild to me to think that I've been
doing the show for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were, I think the first 500 and
something episodes were audio only.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then around 600 or 650, I started
putting out the video because we were
[SPEAKER_01]: locked down or had that crazy virus thingy
that happened to all of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: But 10 years is wild to think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can remember the first episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know who was here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can envision that timeframe.
[SPEAKER_01]: This area wasn't even set up that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: The table was a different direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was different back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: My how we have grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people will message me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll say, hey bro, I just found the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm listening to old episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going back to the archives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes that is so embarrassing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, it's great to hear
how far the show has grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: I left that over compressed microphone
sound.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to have a big old crazy podcast set
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gear has evolved so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just my podcasting gear and video.
[SPEAKER_01]: The video has come a long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I quit using two cameras because camera
two kept giving me shit and I would have
[SPEAKER_01]: to cuss it out in the middle of the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: But things have come a long way in 10
years in podcasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gone a long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me keep focused on the rest of the
email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does go on though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for all of your hard work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro, thank you for the support.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for paying attention and
noticing that the show is 10 years old
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 years of podcasting, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is wild to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're 835 episodes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only missed a couple of Mondays.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did take a couple of breaks because I
was traveling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I had the vid a couple of
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've been banging it out, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gotten really fun to do the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can just turn on the mic and start
rambling.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's super cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: The community shows that I've been doing
this for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I pop up on another podcast,
any other podcast, you guys come and watch
[SPEAKER_01]: and you show the love and I appreciate
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I recently purchased some seeds
from you and I'm looking forward to
[SPEAKER_01]: popping them soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, brother, please do and send pics when
you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it says, have a great day and another
10 years times 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace and love from Eric.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eric, thank you for the great message,
my dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said 10 more years times 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to promise you 10 more years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows where I will be in 10 years at
the way life is changing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows where podcasting will be at the
rate the internet, the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: entertainment, content, the way things are
being delivered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows where this service, this idea
will be in 10 years?
[SPEAKER_01]: You might just have a chip in your neck
that you just think about Rasta Jeff or
[SPEAKER_01]: Growing Weed or my show will play in your
subconscious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows where we're going with this?
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the Apple Vision Pro and all the
VR and shit, who knows where all this
[SPEAKER_01]: entertainment is going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows what podcasting and YouTube will
be five, 10 years from now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then also, who knows where ganja and
cannabis and growing will be in 10 years?
[SPEAKER_01]: Will it be legalized?
[SPEAKER_01]: Will it be recriminalized?
[SPEAKER_01]: Will it be forgotten about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Will people just be over it by then?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, weed, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all smoke weed and grow weed now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut up about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will it just be like a common thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Will it be the Walmart product?
[SPEAKER_01]: Will it be a Monsanto product?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where will the equipment be about growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what kind of gear are we going to
have?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of genetics are we going to have
in 10 years?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, are we going to pot seeds and
they're all completely like exact clones
[SPEAKER_01]: of each other?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we going to have brand new genetics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to be the same?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we going to dial it in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Will my idea of the slurry ever come to
fruition?
[SPEAKER_01]: But who knows what the future holds of
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, who knows what the future of
cannabis holds for state legalization,
[SPEAKER_01]: national, federal legalization?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then what about worldwide legalization of
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then that opens us up to commerce.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if the Americans and the Canadians
can freely move their cannabis back and
[SPEAKER_01]: forth?
[SPEAKER_01]: What if we could take cannabis down south?
[SPEAKER_01]: What if I could mail cannabis to my
buddies in Jamaica?
[SPEAKER_01]: What if my Jamaican friends could send me
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: What if?
[SPEAKER_01]: What if?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where will we be in five, 10?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my buddy said 10 years times 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a hundred years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I'm not podcasting in a hundred
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will be a very boring old man
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably don't want to hear that one,
but I hope by then somebody has grabbed
[SPEAKER_01]: the torch that I have lit, that I have
received from previous growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: previous breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Subcool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope by then somebody grabs this torch
and runs with it and does a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know where, where cannabis will
be in 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the legalization, the science,
where will it be as a community,
[SPEAKER_01]: as a commodity?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll do my best to keep going for as
long as podcasting exists, as long as I've
[SPEAKER_01]: got a voice and a camera and an internet
connection, I'm going to keep it going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got super rambly on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dude, Eric, thank you for pointing out
that the podcast has been going for 10
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please do check your email inbox and check
your spam because you, my friend,
[SPEAKER_01]: have got a coupon code for a gift card for
a free pack of seeds at iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once again, while I'm talking about
these free seeds at iredirect.com,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've received this message from a couple
of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: These gift certificates, these coupon
codes do come with an expiration date.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of people have messaged me and
said, Hey, is that expiration date real?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that is real for logistics,
bookkeeping purposes, website purposes,
[SPEAKER_01]: inventory purposes for a counting
purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those gift cards have to have an
expiration date.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please, when you do get those emails,
get in there and get those seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand you may be waiting for
something to restock.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of the time, they do have about a
30 day expiration date on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, I'm trying to be generous,
but also I've got to keep the business in
[SPEAKER_01]: line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And having a bunch of gift cards out there
that have not been redeemed is daunting as
[SPEAKER_01]: a business owner.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I feel like I owe, it makes you
feel like you owe something and you always
[SPEAKER_01]: want to be able to cover what you owe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they do have to have an expiration
date.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that encourages you to shop more
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I am rambling.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gift cards do expire.
[SPEAKER_01]: That expiration date is real.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just the way that it's got to
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please shop quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That covers that disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's keep it moving because I have got
some momentum happening and it feels good
[SPEAKER_01]: to be on the microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: This next message once again came from the
Grow Help tab on iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came from my new friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is the name?
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend, we're going to call them Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Jeff for the great message.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I saw that you had skunk testers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, a couple of weeks ago, maybe a month
ago by now, I did release two different
[SPEAKER_01]: versions of skunk testers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the 90s and the iry skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two different, different crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to tell you too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a common parent, but then the
other parent is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's more information than you've
had.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like to give you too many details
on testers because it will bias and sway
[SPEAKER_01]: your testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to test it and see what you
see, not what my words influenced you to
[SPEAKER_01]: see is why I don't talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it says, I am not in the position to
be a tester.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that you didn't buy testers
and put them in a drawer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that you're not in the position
to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you held off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're waiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're being polite.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is very cordial.
[SPEAKER_01]: I respect and appreciate that of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to do an episode very soon
all about tester seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will be a very fun one for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this message does say, but I have been
looking for the old stinky three baggers
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk weed from my youth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, my friend, we all have.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I heard because of the illegal
nature of cannabis, they have managed to
[SPEAKER_01]: take this smell away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want that smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, me too, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a time period when there was
a cannabis boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ganja growing got real popular in a large
cultivation setting in a commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, but it was an illegal
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still, those operations got busted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that that's why a lot of our
favorite strains kind of disappeared for a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit, is because those large grows
with that stank got busted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I believe that you're onto something
when you say that cannabis kind of got
[SPEAKER_01]: away from that super stank smell,
because we're trying to hide the aroma and
[SPEAKER_01]: be a little bit more discreet.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you came to the front door and we're
delivering a pizza or looking for your
[SPEAKER_01]: lost cat or trying to sell me Bibles or
whatever they do, and I open the door and
[SPEAKER_01]: it smells like skunks, you know I'm
growing weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to raise some suspicions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you open the door and it smells like
oranges or strawberries, there's a chance
[SPEAKER_01]: you may think I'm eating oranges or
strawberries or something different is
[SPEAKER_01]: happening in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not just going to go, he's growing
a bunch of weed in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just gave us an opportunity for a
little bit more camouflage, a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: less obvious bit of aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that that is part of why we
swayed away from that skunky, stanky
[SPEAKER_01]: smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now, Ganja is getting legalized almost
everywhere, and people that remember that
[SPEAKER_01]: old stank smell, we, you, they,
we all want it back, and I was missing
[SPEAKER_01]: that skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember my uncles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk about my uncles a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had three uncles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two of them heavily influenced my cannabis
career, intake, consumption, appreciation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're both gone now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rest in peace, boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you and miss you every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these two uncles, they smoked the
skunk weed back in the day, and they got
[SPEAKER_01]: excited about skunk weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: My one uncle would be like, hey,
I'll say their names because they're gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eric would be like, hey Ron, I got some
skunk weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Ron was kind of a heavy set dude,
and that motherfucker would run up to the
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking area when there was some skunk
weed to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: The aunts, the fucking my aunts that were
around, they would come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not aunts, like little aunts, my aunts,
my uncle's sisters.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would show up and want to smoke too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, brother, you got some good skunk
weed, and they would fucking get extra
[SPEAKER_01]: lit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the whole house would smell like
a fucking skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I remember skunk from when I was
little, and my uncles were hyped on skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I understand that we all want that
skunk back.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dude said you had skunk testers,
but I wasn't in the position to test them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fucking respectable, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you do want that skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any recommendation?
[SPEAKER_01]: My recommendation that I can recommend
right now is stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those testers that I put out were
basically a preview, a very tip of the
[SPEAKER_01]: iceberg of my skunk experimentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have fallen in love with a couple of
skunk phenotypes that I played with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to talk too much about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the future, once some of the skunk
testing that has gone out has been
[SPEAKER_01]: completed, I will tell you where the skunk
seeds and clones that I played with came
[SPEAKER_01]: from.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were two different batches of seeds,
three different batches of seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: two that got selected from that were that
had the keepers I wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: One clone that is really popular got put
into the mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there were three different skunk
parents that are kind of getting gang
[SPEAKER_01]: banged and different manipulations around
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you more about that,
but stay tuned because there's more skunk
[SPEAKER_01]: coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: That skunk pollination didn't happen to
just a couple of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were many, many plants in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tease that there was a BC lemon
skunk female in the room that got
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinated by the skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a Durban poison that got
pollinated by that skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of stuff got pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those will be trickling out slowly over
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there will be more of these all
remade and then re-bred together and other
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in love with this skunk project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my recommendation is stay tuned and
keep an eye on the website because
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually there will be some skunk stuff
that is tested that will be released and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say soon because breeder
talk soon is way different than consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I say soon to you guys, you're like,
is it ready yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, it's growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said soon,
but breeder talk, grower talk and consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: talk, different time levels there when you
say soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: My recommendation, my bro, stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be more skunk coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in love with the skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't get enough of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That smell, that aroma, that flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if I put the skunk number one to chem
four and chem 91 and stuff like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: What if all that happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just want to grow it before you guys
get to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My hope is that you are trying to recreate
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, trying to recreate it and also add it
to other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put skunk to everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of one of the new ideas here
and also narrow down some skunk turps that
[SPEAKER_01]: we like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say so much, dude, but I can't
reveal too much with the testing that's
[SPEAKER_01]: happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to sway you, but stay tuned
because it's all in my head and obviously
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will talk about it once we get a lot
of test reports back from you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wraps it up with PS Ross to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: PS, I'm a subscriber to your show and I
love when you're on the dude grow show.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a huge compliment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always encouraging to know that the
other listeners of other podcasts
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciate my presence on their show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It lets me know that I'm not intruding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not just being annoying on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's great to know that I'm wanted on
the dude grow show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a good time over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Scotty real, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to grandma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to banner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't shout out the entire crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, you got too many over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're part of the entire DGC crew in
any way, big shout out to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the support and I will be back
on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely do have a good time being on
that Monday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Panel show.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's keep this good momentum
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got another question here in front of
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one also did come from that grow help
tab at I read genetics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came from lunchbox boys tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep that lunchbox strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know what that means.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question says, Yo Ross to Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope all is well with you and your
family.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a smoker's question.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says I have been dabbing for about a
year now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the party, my bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it says I need something to travel
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any suggestions?
[SPEAKER_01]: I always hear you say you've been on dabs
and I was just curious how you dab when on
[SPEAKER_01]: the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let me let me preface all of this with
the disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ross to Jeff is a fictional character and
I do not dab in the car on the road while
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm driving.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would never do anything like that
because I don't believe that that is legal
[SPEAKER_01]: here in the beautiful state of Colorado
and I am a law abiding citizen and I
[SPEAKER_01]: encourage you to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if cannabis were completely legal
and we were allowed to smoke while we
[SPEAKER_01]: drive, I would definitely take big fat
dabs out of a Puffco Peak Guardian.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I use on the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: Allegedly, it's a good device.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a little bit spendy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not the cheapest portable smoking
apparatus, but what I like is the Puffco
[SPEAKER_01]: Guardian or very similar as the Puffco
Peak Pro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably the one that is more
available.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Puffco Peak Pro comes with a basic
chamber.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the upgraded chamber.
[SPEAKER_01]: The extra large 3D chamber is the way to
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives you some more settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives you bigger rips.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what I use.
[SPEAKER_01]: It fits in the cup holder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It holds a charge well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives big fat rips.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to maintain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to clean out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just need a q-tip and you can q-tip it
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It holds a charge for a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives me plenty of dabs for while I'm
gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can charge it with the car charger if
you need that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I suggest my personal device would
be a Puffco Peak Pro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the pro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get the entry level model if you've
got the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the Guardian.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit better, but you don't
need that if you're just going to be using
[SPEAKER_01]: it in the car or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend the Puffco Peak Pro with the
upgraded extra large chamber.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's another 130 or 140 bucks,
but it makes a huge freaking difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely does.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not a show for Puffco.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody has paid me to say this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puffco has never given me a free anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I paid full price.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got my daughter full disclosure.
[SPEAKER_01]: She got it for Christmas.
[SPEAKER_01]: She got a Puffco.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking paid full price for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No discounts or nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody pays me for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the Puffco.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you might want to put a
different topper on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The the smoking piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do that because I just I don't
want to break an expensive part that I
[SPEAKER_01]: travel around with allegedly that might be
in the car.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now me having said that I prefer the
Puffco, my buddy Hot Rod is going to argue
[SPEAKER_01]: with me and say the Carta V2 is where it's
at.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another brand called Carta,
C-A-R-T-A.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make a very fine portable vaporizer
unit that is very comparable to the
[SPEAKER_01]: Puffco.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people will argue which one is
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the Puffco.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: My daughter had a Carta for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hit very good, but it died.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sent it back for a warranty.
[SPEAKER_01]: They returned it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It died again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of our Puffcos have been going
strong, so that is why I stand on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Carta seems like a good product for
most of my friends that have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It rips well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer the Puffco.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the top two.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are several other portable smoking
devices that are available on the market
[SPEAKER_01]: that are more affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, you kind of get what you
pay for with these devices.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do charge you too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are overpriced, but the good shit is
expensive when it comes to portable
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking devices.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people I see online.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a lot of friends with the Dr.
Dabber and the Dr. Dabber Mini,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then there's another Dr. Dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's Debbie Dabber or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one with the ball attachment on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That seems like a quality device,
a quality product.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I have not hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a couple of friends that I dab
with on Discord, and it seems to be
[SPEAKER_01]: reliable and effective for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, I did not buy one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another product out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like it, so I'm not even going to
tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one I don't like, and I'm not
going to recommend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm just going to talk shit about
it and bash it, so I'm not even going to
[SPEAKER_01]: mention it on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to stay classy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend the Puffco, either the Peak
Pro or the Guardian.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another thing out there called the
Proxy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works, but it's not my favorite either.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Puffco Proxy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to buy a Puffco,
I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I take a dab, I need water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want water in mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want bubbles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it so much cooler, more
enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get the Guardian or the Peak and skip
the Proxy is my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a friend with the Proxy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get nearly what I would have
gotten out of a Puffco Peak Pro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think you get what you pay for.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're quality products if you get a good
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I missed something, if there's a
product you recommend, there's a comment
[SPEAKER_01]: section.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and argue about it in the
comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I encourage it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, my buddy Lunchboxboystie,
thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: That question did qualify.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The questions do not have to be grow
related.
[SPEAKER_01]: The questions don't have to be about
growing ganja or about the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be about a product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be some sort of weird advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid to ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dude, make sure you do check your inbox
because you've got a coupon code for a
[SPEAKER_01]: free pack of seeds from iredirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends,
[SPEAKER_01]: foes, smokers, growers, clone cutters,
pollen chuckers, all of you amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis enthusiasts out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you once again for 10
years of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without you guys, this podcast would not
have made it 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without you, this would be a mental issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be a guy with too many toys and too
many pieces of equipment talking to myself
[SPEAKER_01]: and they would probably put me in a padded
room by now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for making this podcast a huge
success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for making iRE genetics a huge
success.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that you are what makes it
successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without us both doing our part,
it would not be what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not go left unseen, unappreciated,
unnoticed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do appreciate the love, the support,
the kindness, the encouragement,
[SPEAKER_01]: the acceptance, all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: The community that is, I want to say that
I built, but I didn't build it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are building that community.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just here with the voice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The community that follows me,
the iRE Army, the Dude Grows crew that
[SPEAKER_01]: hangs out, all the other podcasts that
have followed because they saw me on
[SPEAKER_01]: another show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're all iRE Army.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're all family as far as I'm concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting mushy here at the end of the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's wrap it up and say goodbye while
we're still doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do appreciate you all for listening.

friend Val.
