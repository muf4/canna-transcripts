[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of garlic
banger number six live batter from our
[SPEAKER_00]: friends at Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, it says this is a blend of
head banger, and Han Solo burger.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is described as garlic,
cookies, and sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I crack open the jar, I'm punched in
the face with a pungent garlic aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I take a dab, I get that garlic
aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the exhale, I get a little bit of sour,
and then as it sits on my tongue,
[SPEAKER_00]: I do get a little bit of sweet cookies and
garlic on my tongue as an aftertaste.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I find that description to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back of the package, it says the
product contains 69.97% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am loving the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am loving the buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is delicious concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot
Labs for the delicious garlic banger
[SPEAKER_00]: number six live batter.

[SPEAKER_00]: podcast thank you shout out to my friend
Tommy big thanks big shout out to
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody who supports the show on patreon
if you're not already supporting the show
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'd like to learn how to do so all
you have to do is visit www.patreon.com
[SPEAKER_00]: forward slash grow from your heart all of
the information you need will be right
[SPEAKER_00]: there on the screen once again big thanks
big shout out to everybody who has
[SPEAKER_00]: continued to support the show all right
before we get to the LED talk I need to
[SPEAKER_00]: mention music somebody has asked me to
post a list of the songs which I've played
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end of the podcast I'm going to
update that and I will post that to social
[SPEAKER_00]: media so you guys can get a good list of
the songs I've played though if you've
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoyed some of those tracks you can
download them you can listen to them
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully you support those artists the
music industry is a pain in the ass show
[SPEAKER_00]: some love to the artists that I introduce
you to you probably already know who half
[SPEAKER_00]: of them are but there will be some reggae
bands in there that are slightly obscure
[SPEAKER_00]: to some of you so I will post that list
something I'm going to have to do in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future is stop putting in other people's
music if I want the podcast to grow if I
[SPEAKER_00]: want it playable on other platforms I want
it to expand I'm going to have to quit
[SPEAKER_00]: using copyrighted music every time I put
somebody else's music in the show I do get
[SPEAKER_00]: a copyright notice from YouTube they
aren't mad about it but I think over time
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually they'll say hey you've used 500
of 500 instances of somebody else's songs
[SPEAKER_00]: we're gonna have to fuck with you for that
eventually it may limit me and growing
[SPEAKER_00]: down the future so I'm going to shy away
from using other people's music in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future probably another 10 or 12 episodes
before we can stop doing that we can get
[SPEAKER_00]: away with it but if I want the show to
grow it's something I need to do and I
[SPEAKER_00]: would like the show to grow I'd like to
make the video show go further I'd like to
[SPEAKER_00]: make the audio show go further some
platforms will not take it with other
[SPEAKER_00]: music so the short version of this story
is if you are a producer if you make music
[SPEAKER_00]: out there I would like a short intro track
just about something 30 45 maybe a minute
[SPEAKER_00]: and a half at the longest of course you
know I like reggae I'd like something that
[SPEAKER_00]: kicks in the door with a big fat beat
something that lets you know you're
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to the grow from your heart
podcast hosted by Rasta Jeff something
[SPEAKER_00]: about cannabis culture cannabis community
stay positive in the fucking wording if
[SPEAKER_00]: you put words in there reggae is best you
know I like reggae but I'm open for
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever if you would like to charge me
for a song send me some samples of your
[SPEAKER_00]: work I will see if you are doing what I'm
into I'm picky when it comes to music
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if I'm paying you for it if
you'd like to trade for seeds that's
[SPEAKER_00]: always an option if you'd like to be paid
in cash or PayPal that is always an option
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're a producer out there doing music
doing production especially some sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: reggae project let me know I'd love to get
some music on the show the catch is it has
[SPEAKER_00]: got to be 100% original music I can't use
a remix I can't use a dub I can't use
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that has ever been put on YouTube
or copyrighted before it's got to be for
[SPEAKER_00]: me you can copyright it but you've got to
give me the rights to that music it is
[SPEAKER_00]: mine once I buy it from you I guess it
means I own the copyright right so I'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: copywriting it but what happens is once
somebody puts a track on YouTube YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: has an algorithm that can find that track
and any other music especially popular
[SPEAKER_00]: shit so if I put an obscure song on there
it takes them a couple of days to flag me
[SPEAKER_00]: if I put a popular song on there the
minute that shit uploads YouTube goes hey
[SPEAKER_00]: you just played Metallica we know
Metallica real well you can't do that so
[SPEAKER_00]: it has to be something that has never been
heard by YouTube something that has never
[SPEAKER_00]: been copyrighted played in a video before
original music so if you've got some music
[SPEAKER_00]: contact me the email address is grow from
your heart at hotmail.com I'd love to get
[SPEAKER_00]: your music on the show if you'd just like
to send me just donate a track I will
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely play it give me all the artist
info you need so I can give you a shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out give you credit for your work maybe
I'll send you some beans or a shirt or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that you'll definitely get
a shout out on the show but okay that's
[SPEAKER_00]: enough of that I've been talking for a
long time I need music you guys I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: keep borrowing music I need original
tracks help a Wookie out thank you where
[SPEAKER_00]: are we going next LED talk you guys holy
shit I have been very hesitant to switch
[SPEAKER_00]: over to LED lighting a lot of people tell
me LED is the way it's more effective it's
[SPEAKER_00]: more efficient it's more affordable the
plants seem they say the plants seem to
[SPEAKER_00]: like it I am a commercial grower I'm known
my reputation is for running commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: grows and also for being a breeder in a
commercial environment I rely on numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're going to talk about numbers in
the future but I rely on weights and
[SPEAKER_00]: potency and scheduling and I know that the
double-ended Gavita lights the
[SPEAKER_00]: double-ended HPS lights which I've been
using in a commercial production they hit
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the numbers I need I don't know
that I would ever switch my commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: grow away from double-ended HPS bulbs in
talking with a few friends they've
[SPEAKER_00]: convinced me to give LED lighting a try
I've made good friends with a guy who owns
[SPEAKER_00]: an LED company shout out to my buddy Keith
Keith and I were talking and he said bro
[SPEAKER_00]: why don't you run a couple of these LEDs
in a tent and let me know what you think
[SPEAKER_00]: he honestly gave me two cannon lights from
black sale market so I've got two cannons
[SPEAKER_00]: from black sale in a five by five tent
I've been running them for I'm looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: the date I'm gonna say all of April and
most of May most of April and all of May I
[SPEAKER_00]: messed that up but they've been going for
almost two months now and I am honestly
[SPEAKER_00]: completely impressed with the growth that
I am seeing from these LED lights I was
[SPEAKER_00]: really hesitant to spend money on them and
change my setup but when somebody gave me
[SPEAKER_00]: two of them I put a tent in a spare room I
put some lights some plants some seedlings
[SPEAKER_00]: under there my tongue is tied up today but
we'll get a podcast going don't worry guys
[SPEAKER_00]: I put plants under the lights is the way
that worked and they've been growing for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while and I am seeing amazing growth I
also put a cloner on the peripheral edge
[SPEAKER_00]: of that tent it was outside of the tent
just on the outside of the tent on a
[SPEAKER_00]: little little table and those clones
rooted super quickly they loved that LED
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting so the clones showed me right
away when I cut clones they never drooped
[SPEAKER_00]: they never did anything weird they went
into an easy cloner there was at the edge
[SPEAKER_00]: of the tent and that light from that
cannon light at the middle of the tent
[SPEAKER_00]: shown out enough to make those clones grow
super happily they never drooped they
[SPEAKER_00]: never skipped a beat that told me
something right away I've been watching
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants that I put in there grow
they're staying super short and super
[SPEAKER_00]: squat the node spacing is super tight most
of the time I would get I'm gonna guess
[SPEAKER_00]: about an inch between nodes and right now
we're about a half maybe three quarters of
[SPEAKER_00]: an inch between nodes so normally I would
veg under t5 lighting was my go-to
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting for veg I vegged under LEDs and I
see much more rapid growth I see much more
[SPEAKER_00]: nodes tighter node spacing I see more
branching so I've got my node spacing my
[SPEAKER_00]: branches are growing out and off of those
branches I am getting more shoots the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are in veg they're still what I
would consider small plants I have had to
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliate them two times and I've bottomed
and cleaned them up because they are so
[SPEAKER_00]: bushy and so branchy that they would
survive the way they are but being a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial cultivator I like to go in and
take off excessive leaves and excessive
[SPEAKER_00]: branches that makes my plants grow more at
the top it encourages growth to the top
[SPEAKER_00]: excuse me it also allows for more airflow
throughout the canopy throughout the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: so I did some defoliating because these
LEDs are making the plants grow rapidly
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not used to this fast of growth in my
veg room so I think I'm really impressed
[SPEAKER_00]: they're growing faster they're growing
very healthy they are eating like a
[SPEAKER_00]: champion I've noticed that I don't see any
nutrient burn and I am feeding the shit
[SPEAKER_00]: out of these plants usually by now what I
call getting the nails done the little
[SPEAKER_00]: tips of the leaves would have browned up a
little bit that is not happening to these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants I think they love it also it is not
as hot I replaced a so in that normal room
[SPEAKER_00]: there would be a 600 or a thousand watt
HPS depending on the season in the summer
[SPEAKER_00]: I would run the six in the winter I'd run
the thousand that's just things we do in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado to adjust it's colder in the
winter run that thousand keep the house
[SPEAKER_00]: warm it gets a little bit hotter in the
summer take that thousand out put a six in
[SPEAKER_00]: there so we don't have to compete with it
as much but so in flower I would have a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand in there in veg or a six in veg I
would have two T fives in there right now
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got two 320 watt Canon LEDs from
black sail and the room is not too hot I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have any air conditioning running I
don't have a swamp cooler running I've
[SPEAKER_00]: just got the lights running in the room
with the ambient airflow from the house
[SPEAKER_00]: and the air exchange I've got a fan
blowing the air out of the room so that we
[SPEAKER_00]: get a little air exchange other than that
there's no special arrangements and it is
[SPEAKER_00]: not too hot in there the plants really
seem to be thriving they're not stretching
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not doing anything weird they're
not having any nutrient deficiencies I
[SPEAKER_00]: think I am impressed with LED lighting
especially these Canon LEDs from our
[SPEAKER_00]: friends at black sail they did not pay me
to say this Keith does not know this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast is happening right now I'm just so
excited about the lights that I wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly come on here and talk about it
with you guys the part I really wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about that was kind of a setup it
made me think about by watching these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants they're growing differently than my
plants in the past have grown because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the lighting I've got brand new seedlings
in there that I've never grown before plus
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also got familiar plants in there
that I'm very familiar with which I've
[SPEAKER_00]: grown lots of times for years ten years
some of them three years others some of
[SPEAKER_00]: them are not as old but I'm familiar with
them I'm seeing different growth I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing different leaf shapes I'm seeing
different structures not completely
[SPEAKER_00]: different but as a breeder I am noticing
differences the plants are squattier
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not branching the branches aren't
as long the apical tops the dominant tops
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't as dominant they're not as
ridiculous everything is staying a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit shorter and tighter the canopy is more
even without as much manipulation I am
[SPEAKER_00]: wondering if I would have chosen different
phenotypes in all of my selections in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past if I had been growing with LED
lighting I may have seen different traits
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have seen different features I may
have seen different colors I may I haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: flowered under these lights yet I may
discover that I'm getting different aromas
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have discovered that I'm getting
different buzzes from these finished
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers I'm wondering if I've been growing
under LEDs maybe my breeding would have
[SPEAKER_00]: gone different directions I'm wondering if
my growing would have gone a completely
[SPEAKER_00]: different direction had I been using LED
lighting in the past because my plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: acting completely different was there a
phenotype in the past they got too
[SPEAKER_00]: stretchy that I eliminated but maybe under
these LED lights it would have stayed nice
[SPEAKER_00]: and squat and it would have been a fucking
champion that's just some weird path that
[SPEAKER_00]: my brain went down did I select wrong
plants I know I didn't select wrong plants
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys are breeding with them you guys
are growing them I'm having fun you're
[SPEAKER_00]: having fun they're definitely successful
but it's got me second-guessing selections
[SPEAKER_00]: now it's got me wondering like did we make
mistakes in the past it's also got me
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about going back and getting old
batches of seeds and growing them and
[SPEAKER_00]: looking through them again to see let's
just take a rise for an example you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: know I've grown tons of arise seeds I grew
out probably 500 seeds looking for King
[SPEAKER_00]: Solomon just for that male so I got to see
500 different plants of that grow what if
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow 500 more under LEDs am I gonna see
different shit I probably am just that one
[SPEAKER_00]: variation is going to meet give me such
different shit so think keep that puts me
[SPEAKER_00]: down a lot of other paths keep that in
mind when you're shopping for seeds most
[SPEAKER_00]: of my stuff I send out to a lot of people
and let them test it so we get to see what
[SPEAKER_00]: it does under LEDs under HPS under ceramic
metal halides under t5s we also get to see
[SPEAKER_00]: some experimental shit that crazy people
do out there and I love it keep doing that
[SPEAKER_00]: but keep in mind you're going to get
different results I say when I grow it I
[SPEAKER_00]: get this but until now I've been growing
under HPS is now that I'm growing under
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs I may my flavor profiles may expand I
may see completely different things out of
[SPEAKER_00]: my breeding out of my growing this may
change a lot for me and keep that in mind
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're selecting that what I have
said is based on my HPS lights I do use
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback from a lot of other growers I've
got testers I've got friends there they
[SPEAKER_00]: all get the seeds they grow them I use
their input but obviously my descriptions
[SPEAKER_00]: and things are mostly from what I
discovered because I can rely on myself
[SPEAKER_00]: when three people say it tastes like
strawberries the word strawberries goes
[SPEAKER_00]: into the description if one guy says it
tasted like a dog fart I don't put the
[SPEAKER_00]: word dog fart in the description if six
people said dog fart that goes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: description but ultimately I make the
description decisions so keep that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff in mind you guys I was just kind of
I thought it was really profound I had a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of deep thought maybe I was baked but
I was sitting there thinking man was I
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking up for all these years growing
under HPS isn't selecting differently
[SPEAKER_00]: making a switch really triggered thoughts
in my brain then there's another path that
[SPEAKER_00]: my brain went down I'm gonna call them our
forefathers the guys before me the guys
[SPEAKER_00]: before them and the guys before them the
guys that were growing cannabis in the 60s
[SPEAKER_00]: and or 70s I don't know exactly when
people started doing home grows around
[SPEAKER_00]: here but in the states when people started
doing home grows we were very limited on
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment we didn't have a grow store what
was a grow light nobody was growing
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors so we didn't have a grow light and
if you had access to a grow light you
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't gonna go buy it because people
would say what the fuck are you doing with
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow light they would expect you to
have a greenhouse or show up with tomatoes
[SPEAKER_00]: or cucumbers in a few weeks and that
shit's not gonna happen so there were no
[SPEAKER_00]: grow lights back in the day also there
weren't websites with very detailed strain
[SPEAKER_00]: descriptions and seeds available for
people to work with so people back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: day were very limited on equipment
products and everything everything
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge especially but they were relying
on the lighting they had a lot of people I
[SPEAKER_00]: know older growers that would tell us
about stealing streetlights or older
[SPEAKER_00]: growers they would talk about stealing the
lights at the gym they were using whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: lights were available to them and
experimenting they didn't know that
[SPEAKER_00]: certain colors would do certain things to
the plants they didn't know that certain
[SPEAKER_00]: lights made certain color spectrums they
did not have any clue of that shit yet
[SPEAKER_00]: they were still trying to figure out
indoor cultivation from the beginning so
[SPEAKER_00]: the pioneers is what we'll call them the
cannabis indoor pioneers were getting
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever lights were available they were
getting whatever dirt was available we
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have a lot of studying we didn't
have a lot of access if you lived in rural
[SPEAKER_00]: Arizona you were using probably rural
Arizona dirt you didn't have a grow store
[SPEAKER_00]: you may not have a nursery and if you did
like I said before you didn't have an
[SPEAKER_00]: excuse to go buy this shit so you may have
to drive an hour away buy something that
[SPEAKER_00]: works you know whatever grandma Betty's
potting soil from whatever local farm
[SPEAKER_00]: store that was near you and then drive
that back home an hour away so that nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: knew what you bought and then put your
hopefully get some seeds from somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: that's another thing where are we gonna
get seeds from back in the day you either
[SPEAKER_00]: had to know somebody that had some seeds
you had to buy some weed that had seeds in
[SPEAKER_00]: it and grow those and hope for success or
what a lot of people were doing is our
[SPEAKER_00]: military members were traveling overseas
or a lot of adventurous folks were
[SPEAKER_00]: traveling overseas and they were acquiring
seeds from farms where the cannabis was
[SPEAKER_00]: originated and they were bringing those
seeds back here then they would get here
[SPEAKER_00]: with seeds who knows where they came from
all the soldiers know where they came from
[SPEAKER_00]: but I mean we had seeds coming from
everywhere we had seeds coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: Thailand we had seeds coming from
Afghanistan we had seeds coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: Vietnam we had seeds coming from Brazil we
probably had seeds from Morocco there were
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds coming from Mexico there were seeds
coming from everywhere all all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't know what we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: We probably had Colombian gold seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We probably had Panama red seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We probably had some Jamaican seeds,
probably some Colombian, something of
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But who knows what it was, unless you knew
which buds it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were just growing seeds at random.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no, you couldn't Google it and
say, I've got a rye seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: A rye is a cross of golden goat and
daybreaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should take nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should taste like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can fucking look at Rasta Jeff's
podcast and know exactly how to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't have that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all experimenting and flying by
the seed of their pants while they were
[SPEAKER_00]: getting stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of what we've got now,
a lot of the selections were done through
[SPEAKER_00]: the shittiest equipment, through the
shittiest sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like where do the seeds come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: What equipment were they using?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of nutrients were they using?
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't know much about nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there were a few guys,
I mean, people were studying, people were
[SPEAKER_00]: advanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were horticultural specialists back
then, but nobody was advanced as we are
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you couldn't dial shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't just click on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to go to the library and read
books and people wouldn't go do that back
[SPEAKER_00]: in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially potheads.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they caught a pothead at the library
reading a cultivation book, they already
[SPEAKER_00]: know what you're doing and you don't want
to go there anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: You stink like weed and you don't fit in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of our selections came from our
forefathers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to select shit from random seeds,
from random lighting, with random
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, with random grow equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were probably growing with rocks and
five gallon buckets under a street light
[SPEAKER_00]: in the basement, just trying to figure it
all out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really got my mind thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're using all of that stuff as
our breeding stock now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the shit that those guys selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the sixties and the seventies,
maybe even before that, because cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: has been around for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard stories of way back in the day,
jazz musicians would come into town.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say that I know jazz musicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: They play at the club down the street
after the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all come here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoke a little bit of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They crash on my couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get up the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go to the next state to play another
gig while they're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to smoke, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was way back in the day before
everybody had herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would leave me some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd say, Hey, Jeff, these seeds came
out of our herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you like to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to come on tour next year
because we're traveling musicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want you to grow this, grow these
seeds, produce this herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then next year, when we come back,
you'll have more seeds and more herb for
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can smoke with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can give us, you could probably sell
us some herb if you grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how that worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the arrangement, but you give
them herb, you give them seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you end up with urban seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they travel around and they take
that herb to the next state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm in Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll say their next gig is in fucking
Santa Fe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They drive down to Santa Fe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They leave some of my new seeds that I've
made with the people in Santa Fe and some
[SPEAKER_00]: weed with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they say, grow this next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everywhere they travel, they dropped
off weed and seeds if they had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every time they came back next
year, weed and seeds and they expand every
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did more gigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't have to wait till Albuquerque
to get to the next gig.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got to play in Trinidad next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it was Pueblo, Trinidad,
Albuquerque, Santa Fe, and they've got
[SPEAKER_00]: weed growing everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just some stories I've heard about
how people used to start getting people
[SPEAKER_00]: growing weed and having a reliable supply
of cannabis for when you're traveling
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Old jazz musician story.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was told to me by some old jazz
musician cats.
[SPEAKER_00]: But man, think about those guys were the
ones selecting your cannabis breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just dropped off some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those guys had to select from
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: From that gene pool was what they got to
work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got to either, I'm not sure,
do we thank or do we blame our forefathers
[SPEAKER_00]: for the selections which we're working
with now?
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a lot of guys like Mel Frank
out there doing great selections,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also there were a lot of guys out
there in basements just doing random
[SPEAKER_00]: selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of that became our future
gene pool, what we've got now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of the stuff we're working with now
was based off of just really archaic
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment, archaic selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, it really makes my brain
think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would selections have been different?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would we be working with different
cannabis plants today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would different shit be popular?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would it have taken a totally different
route?
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think that they didn't have lab
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody was looking for other secondary
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody was focused on high THC because
the only thing they had is a test.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only test was them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could smoke it and go, I'm high as
fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they could smoke it and go,
nah, I didn't get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the lab test for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tossed out everything that didn't
get you high as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it didn't have the red eye head buzz to
it that we were looking for, it went away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically I was just daydreaming and
wondering how cannabis would be different
[SPEAKER_00]: if we had done different selections,
if we'd had different equipment,
[SPEAKER_00]: different technology, different seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, I don't know, my brain went down
that path and I thought it was a fun
[SPEAKER_00]: ramble to share with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is my rant on LED lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to my buddy Keith at Black
Sale Market for hooking me up with two
[SPEAKER_00]: Canon LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly was so impressed with the first
two, but I ordered three more already.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be hung up very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to go in the mother room and
the small veg space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once I see how this first room
flowers out, if I'm as excited as I think
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be, I will replace all of the
lights in my personal flower space with
[SPEAKER_00]: LED lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll switch my personal grow from HD to
HPS, all to LED lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The commercial grow will stay the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not ready to make that leap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe when the technology evolves a
little, a little better and maybe when I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: a little more impressed with it,
but not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so far the home grow is going to make
the switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
I did say I was going to read a Patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into that part of the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not supporting the show on
Patreon and you'd like to learn how to do
[SPEAKER_00]: so, all you have to do is visit www
.patreon.com forward slash grow from your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the information you need is right
there on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's Patreon message goes just like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Rasta Jeff, refer to me as smoke what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there is a possibility I could be
in prohibition land, but who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know nothing, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I heard on your show
that a few people were unable to continue
[SPEAKER_00]: their Patreon subscription.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lately I've been blessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought it is my time to step up and
help a brother out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys aren't able to help out on
Patreon during this weird COVID time,
[SPEAKER_00]: please don't stress on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do appreciate all of the people who
have stepped up during this weirdness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you and big thanks to our friend
smoke what for the new Patreon support.
[SPEAKER_00]: His message goes on to say, I'm starting
to experiment with creating some personal
[SPEAKER_00]: seats, but I battle temps with my LEDs and
small spaces and I have trouble running
[SPEAKER_00]: over 400 Watts and summer is right around
the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You better figure out how to cool that
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I don't have any questions,
but the project I'm starting is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a fun one and I cannot wait to update
you in a year or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to the updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot wait to see what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says since I might have to wait until
winter to produce any seeds, it could be
[SPEAKER_00]: an uphill battle reaching some of my goals
until we find some legalization here and I
[SPEAKER_00]: can stretch out a bit bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get yourself in trouble and my
advice is if it's going to be an uphill
[SPEAKER_00]: battle, wait until the winter because you
don't want to make struggle seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is another paragraph here and it
says one thing I thought might be a good
[SPEAKER_00]: idea is to collect genetics for when my
state opens up to the legal markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you suggest for strains that
are either overlooked in the legal
[SPEAKER_00]: community or ones that possibly never made
it into the legal cannabis markets?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have most of the popular ones in your
collection, but I don't know much about
[SPEAKER_00]: other strains out there despite there
being epic strains everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking of something that I can bring
to the grows that lack the product to fill
[SPEAKER_00]: them when legalization passes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says anyways until next time,
stay iry, hug your mom and take a fat dab
[SPEAKER_00]: for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emphasis on the dabs because concentrates
are too illegal here and I don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: risk the 10 to 20 year lodging they offer
for having them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit, that puts life into
perspective, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person said 10 to 20 years for
possession of concentrates where they are
[SPEAKER_00]: and I have got four, eight, 12 and there
is at least 20 grams of concentrates
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting here on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, that puts shit into perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am blessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thankful to be here to be able to take
these dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will for sure take a fat dab for you my
friend Smoke What.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's focus on the question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke What asked, they want to start
saving genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to have genetics ready for when
legalization happens in their area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to be able to put quality
genetics into a dispensary and they want
[SPEAKER_00]: to know what I would suggest for strains
that are either overlooked or possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: never made it into legal cannabis markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strains that never made it that are often
overlooked are kind of some of the older
[SPEAKER_00]: strains that people ask for.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you open a dispensary and you start
getting traffic, you're going to get an
[SPEAKER_00]: older demographic that will ask for stuff
like Acapulco Gold and Colombian Gold and
[SPEAKER_00]: the Panama Red and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to want that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The veteran age guys are going to want
that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's going to be another crowd
that comes in and they're going to want
[SPEAKER_00]: Durban Poison and White Widow and
Trainwreck.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a generational thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after that, you're going to get
people that come in and want Sour Diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: and ChemDog and OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another generational thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then right after that, you're going to get
people that want all of the wedding cake
[SPEAKER_00]: and cake bomb and fucking Girl Scout
cookies and all the Girl Scout cookies out
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit's going to happen also.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really hard to fill all of the needs
for a dispensary for the shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of asked me to mention things
that were overlooked or things that have
[SPEAKER_00]: been forgotten about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before, the Panamas,
the Acapulcos, the Colombians,
[SPEAKER_00]: those things missed the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never made it into the dispensary,
but there's probably a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a commercial environment, you've got to
meet goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to reach production goals and
that has to be a schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants take 11 or 12 weeks to
flower, they're probably not going to make
[SPEAKER_00]: it in a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need nine weekers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it takes eight to 10 weeks,
I'm going to run it nine weeks to fit into
[SPEAKER_00]: my schedules and that plant, if it wants
to go nine, if it survives, if it makes
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody happy, that qualifies for the
commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to put out weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to hit harvest goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of my plants hit certain weights.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't hit enough weight,
I'm not going to reach goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to get bonuses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to have enough medicine
for the shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody will be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot keep that plant in the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got to reach the weight goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has also got to reach potency goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it puts out a whole bunch of weed in
nine weeks, but when people smoke it,
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody gets high, that plant's got to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got to flower on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to put out weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also got to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I put it on the shelf, does it go
anywhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are probably 70 strains in a lot of
my commercial production facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have somewhere between 50 and 70 mother
plants per commercial cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a reason for each and every one
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one of them slows down or doesn't have
momentum on the shelf, if it sits there
[SPEAKER_00]: for long enough toward the time I grow the
next batch, if they've still got some of
[SPEAKER_00]: that, I don't grow it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant gets cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: We remove that from the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't work for a commercial
cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a lot of things to think
about when you're trying to select
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics for a commercial cultivation
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every dispensary should have something
fruity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying fruity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want fruity flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's Blue Dream or Golden Goat,
that qualifies as fruity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody needs a berry flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's blueberry, if it's cherry,
you need some kind of berries in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: a berry mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need floral.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think every dispensary needs something
floral.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to smell like sweet flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Girls love that floral smell and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some guys love it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need fruit, berries, and floral.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be one strain that covers all
of those, and hopefully they don't catch
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got three strains to cover
fruit, berries, and floral, you're in
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, every dispensary needs something
that smells gassy and or fuely,
[SPEAKER_00]: sour diesel, Chem Di95, something in that
fuely, funky, gassy kind of range.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also need some earthy smelling shit,
something like OG Kush, something like a
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubba Kush, a pre-98 Bubba, something in
that realm, something like the GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Berries, floral, gas, and earth is
something that I think all dispensaries
[SPEAKER_00]: are required to have on their shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is your basic shopping area right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after that, people are going to ask
for your highest lab tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about the lab tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got something that tests real
high in the labs, that is a really good
[SPEAKER_00]: thing to put on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that 35% THC sticker on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll walk in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be drawn to that sticker.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll buy that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't ask any other questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what people want.
[SPEAKER_00]: People want something with a really strong
head buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I walk in, I want the thing that's
going to make me go, oh shit, I'm having a
[SPEAKER_00]: panic attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the weed I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have something with a really strong
head buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have something with a really strong body
buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to find people that want to
relax, people that want to take a nap,
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are high strung and need to
chill the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need something with that body buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may find people that want something
with high CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned before they want high THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want that lab test that's really
appealing to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, CBD is very popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may want to find a strain that is
high in CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those lab tests go a long way in a retail
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So put the lab numbers on the jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have the lab numbers available to where
people can see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll see that number.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll forget everything they were
talking about or saying or thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll go, I want that 35% jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they'll buy that and you make
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lab tests really help a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something high THC, high CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also think about the other cannabinoids,
which are becoming popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: THCV is really popular right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are looking for THCV products.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can find a strain high in V,
put that on your shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brag about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advertise about it because it is not a
super popular trait right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else you're going to need to
have on the strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG Kush and OG Kush crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wants some sort of a Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need that stanky OG Kush aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's an OG cross, a straight up
OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a Kush on the shelf,
people will be drawn to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the younger kids, the gangster
guys, they heard Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a rap song, they're going to come buy
Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diesel, I mentioned before, diesel is
popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a diesel, but don't embarrass
yourself and grow something that says
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel and does not smell like diesel at
all because we will call you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll say, that's not fucking diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That smells like berries and fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want fucking diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get a real diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, don't waste your time because it
will be embarrassing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem Di95, sour diesel, something like
that will make you real happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem, we need some chem dog genetics on
every shelf at every dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got so many options for chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got chem 91, you got chem D,
you got chem four, you got chem sister.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put some chem dog on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody loves chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit will sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it'll make you stand out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot of people can grow some really
fire chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got the chem and it's doing the
job right, it will make everybody happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then here are some things you need to
think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of, and I'm thinking that you're
opening a dispensary and I'm kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking down the road for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of vibe do you want your
dispensary to have?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you stock the stuff like the Acapulco
gold and that Panama red and the Colombian
[SPEAKER_00]: gold and shit, you're going to bring in an
older veteran type of crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got the OG Kush and the sour
diesel, you're going to bring in a younger
[SPEAKER_00]: type of crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to cater to medical patients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to cater to the hype crowd?
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of get to decide that by the
atmosphere, the ambiance, the environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the products which you stock at your
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you want to carry the hype shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to have, I don't even know the
new hype shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to have Gelato 44 and cake
bomb and cherry cake and wedding pie?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to have all that shit on the
shelf?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to bring all the youngsters
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to bring all the hip kids,
all the hype beats, all the youngsters,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the Instagram kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all going to come in for that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have a shop like Cookies where you
just got flow in all day, or you can have
[SPEAKER_00]: a little quaint shop that is kind of up to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you want that hype shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get that if you want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will bring the hype crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want that older stuff, the Acapulco
gold, the Panama red, that is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring you that older crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you may notice that young hype
crowd and that old veteran crowd,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't blend perfectly well together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the best marketing strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may sound crazy because they both got
money in their pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all buying herb, but you've got to
set the environment that you expect for
[SPEAKER_00]: your dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a niche thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got the Acapulco gold and the
fucking cake bomb, you'll get a good
[SPEAKER_00]: crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to keep it balanced out of what
stays on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've only got so much shelf space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've only got so many plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of thinking to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So which kind of crowd do you want to
bring?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of atmosphere do you want to
invent?
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of products do you want to
offer?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is all up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said before, everybody's going to want a
Girl Scout Cookies cross, especially right
[SPEAKER_00]: when you open up in a new market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has heard about Girl Scout
Cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to want cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same as I said about Sour Diesel,
if you've got a real Girl Scout Cookies
[SPEAKER_00]: cut, if you've got the form cut,
if you've got the thin mint cut,
[SPEAKER_00]: put that shit on the shelf at the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a knockoff Girl Scout
Cookies, if you've got a bag seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you've got something that you bought
from seeds from somebody and it came out
[SPEAKER_00]: questionable, not 100% Girl Scout Cookies,
don't put it on the shelf because an
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced connoisseur smoker will come
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll look at it and they'll go,
that is not Girl Scout Cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your place is whack.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to say you got Sour D and
it's not Sour D, I'm leaving.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you try to say you got Girl Scout
Cookies and it's not Girl Scout Cookies,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking leaving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure if you're selling and displaying
a hype strain, make sure it is grown and
[SPEAKER_00]: displayed properly and that it is really
what you're saying it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us can tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can look at Girl Scout Cookies buds and
tell you, nope, or oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell by the look.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell by the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can crack it open.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell by the texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Girl Scout Cookies very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most connoisseurs do know the cookies very
well and we will call you if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people are going to want Girl Scout
Cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to want train wreck.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to want anything with the
word cake in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cake bomb, wedding cake, a rise cake that
doesn't exist, but I'm sure it would
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking sell if it existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gelatos, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biscotti, all that popular stuff is going
to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all about kind of what you want to
put on the dispensary shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of all about what you want to put in
your cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: What goes in the trays?
[SPEAKER_00]: What goes in the rooms?
[SPEAKER_00]: What grows well for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to grow well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to hit numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be not a pain in the ass to
trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it slows down the trim crew too much,
get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it messes up any of your flow,
it needs to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it works well for everything from the
beginning to the end, if it goes from the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed to the cash register without
problems, put that shit on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that shit in the grow, but it also has
to make all of the consumers happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to kind of decide what ends up
happening as people set up dispensaries
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of based on like my breeding is based
on what I enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dispensary would be filled with strains
that I enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would attract a crowd similar to myself
that smokes and enjoys things that I
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The demographic would end up being
probably 25 to 45 year old dudes that
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to reggae and have dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be a big part of my demographic at
my dispensary, but that that would be cool
[SPEAKER_00]: with me because that's who I hang out
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want everybody to come and shop,
but I mean the main core would just be 25
[SPEAKER_00]: to 40 year old dudes with dreadlocks
listening to reggae music on their way to
[SPEAKER_00]: band practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably it would stop by.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all up to you what you want to put
in the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to work in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to work on the shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to work for the consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I gave you a pretty good rundown
of all the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fruit, berries, floral gas, head buzz,
body buzz, THC, CBD, maybe some THCV.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need OG Kush, sour diesel,
chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want those old things for the old
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get it in there or maybe you
don't, if it doesn't work in the garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe there's a reason why that shit is
not around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to work with the hype shit and
how do you want your menu to look?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
