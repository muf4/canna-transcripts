[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is episode six hundred and fifty
three of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, Mike is joining me to
talk about a new rule change here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show, Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And good to be back, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm glad to have you back,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pandemic had things weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to talk too much about the P
word, but you're joining us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it's a good show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad you're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad you're safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad you're healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I'm glad you are surviving the flood
and the rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to sound like an old guy
talking too much about the weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, dude, it is raining in town right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If if our connections look shitty on this
Zoom video, you guys, we apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never said the word deluge,
but I think it may be deluge outside
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be the official word.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's been a lot of rainfall in
the last couple of hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's yeah, the grow rooms, the grows
are using all of the gear today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the air conditioner, the
dehumidifier, the fan, everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the heater today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe by the end of the night,
we'll kick on that heater for a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using all of the equipment in the
grow room today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the grow room gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dehumidifier is working for its
fucking money today.
Work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's the dehumidifiers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most important piece of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, today it is working.
[SPEAKER_02]: You went up the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we that's the MVP today is that
dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, I feel like it is a good chance to
give you the opportunity to let us know
[SPEAKER_00]: how people can stalk you on social media
and also maybe how they can find you on
[SPEAKER_00]: what's that Facebook page you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another one I'm thinking about.

[SPEAKER_00]: I try to go once a month, maybe every two
weeks if there's something worth talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get a coupon code, save a couple of
bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always really helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm advertising too much and
rambling here at the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a point to this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did mention that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have a serious topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there are a lot of rules changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They changed some rules here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I hit that part, I did have a
couple of more bullet points.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of new legal states coming
online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike mentioned that in the pre-ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pre-ramble is such a good word,
like a preamble, but it's the pre-ramble I
[SPEAKER_00]: just made that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our pre-ramble, we talked about new
states coming online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Virginia, I think Mike said shout out to
the guru.
[SPEAKER_00]: If Virginia is now legal, big up to guru.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as you said it, it didn't sound
right in my ear, so I'm going to check it
[SPEAKER_02]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's Google.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he might be correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of those places.
[SPEAKER_00]: New Mexico is definitely legal now.
[SPEAKER_00]: New Mexico had some controversy because
they had a, basically, I don't remember
[SPEAKER_00]: the letters of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a New Mexico medical marijuana
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of my friends just got their
medical marijuana cards renewed,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they paid big money to get certain
plant counts and do all this stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: and now they're allowed to grow so much
product legally because the state of New
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico made these rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, those rules changed on the 1st,
and now all that money that my friend paid
[SPEAKER_00]: for his card to be valid for the next 18
months is no longer valid, and he's trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to find some recourse with the state of
New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: New Mexico is kind of telling him to go
fuck himself, so that's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm getting at in the long rambles
here is just because your location may
[SPEAKER_00]: have gone legal doesn't mean that you can
walk out in the streets with your bong and
[SPEAKER_00]: do bong rips for prosperity.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's so many rules, and it's your
responsibility, unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_00]: to know them before you go partake or
participate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be wait to be told the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know them before you break them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are not intuitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, but just because it's legal
where you are doesn't mean that you can go
[SPEAKER_00]: taking bong rips in the streets.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can smoke joints in the car,
find out the rules and regulations where
[SPEAKER_00]: you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, if the thing was voted on today
and it passed today, people think we can
[SPEAKER_00]: dab in the streets today.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but you got to wait for it to actually
go into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take a little time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's not just like, hey,
we could dab now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, nope, no, we got to pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rule passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you got to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a buffer time that you got to wait
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love the excitement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the enthusiasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think don't don't think that just
because it's legal, you can overdo
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself and then end up in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when I'm going somewhere else,
I went to another state just recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to another place to go visit and
have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I went there, I googled the rules
around cannabis because I knew the people
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going with.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's there was going to be cannabis in
my group.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that somehow someway when I got
there, there would be cannabis products
[SPEAKER_00]: involved and I knew we would be consuming
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I googled possession laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Possession limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens if I get caught with
concentrates?
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens if I get caught with
concentrate gear?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what if I have a rig and a torch and
a carb cap and dabs in the car?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what are my opportunities here?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can buy stuff in a store in Colorado
that will get you years in prison in
[SPEAKER_02]: nearby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Mike, you guys, I'm going to talk over
Mike for a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's connection cut out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to talk for a moment and
let him catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike can't hear me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's given me the ear signals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you guys, I'm just going to ramble
till Mike's connection catches up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure you understand what's
going on by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point is we could buy stuff here in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I drive to Kansas, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike is back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, you made a very good point,
brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could buy some stuff here at a
dispensary 30 miles from the Kansas border
[SPEAKER_00]: and drive that 30 miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as I hit that fucking border,
boom, I'm fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are so many state troopers
waiting at the Utah border, the Kansas
[SPEAKER_00]: border.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the one North Wyoming?
[SPEAKER_00]: New Mexico doesn't have any fucking cops,
so they're not sitting there waiting for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get a little bit more south.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, honestly, you guys, there are some
cops in New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_02]: A friendly medical marijuana state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're recreational, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, they're recreational.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and they just went rec.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Texas is the big one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I always think of because a grandma
hash in Colorado is just a fucking good
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: A grandma hash in Texas is hard drugs that
your ass is on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to prison for the fucked up
part about Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, the one of the many Texas,
I love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pick on Texas a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing but love for Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Empire Dave.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the fucked up things about Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is my Green Dot Labs concentrate
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a jar of fatso number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just scooped the last dab out of here
for me in this jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see there's for the people just
listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are remnants like if I were a
residue, if I were a youngster and I were
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking scrounging up for concentrates,
I could get two or three of these jars and
[SPEAKER_00]: scrape that out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could get a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could definitely make a dab out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In years past, when things weren't the way
they should be, I've been known to fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: pull a couple of jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's a dab fucking in all of
these and scraping together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that's the old school.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the new school version of scraping
your fucking pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me scrape all my jars in Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be I would be charged with the
weight of this jar and its lid,
[SPEAKER_00]: which this is a glass jar with a big,
dense plastic lid.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is at least an ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be charged with an ounce of
concentrate because of this container.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same legal classification is meth and
heroin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to drop it on the table and you
can hear how damn heavy it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really need to know the rules,
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the tangent we're on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is incredibly important to know the
rules where you're playing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Texas, they charge you for your
container weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you got some shit in Texas,
carry a parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way it's lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just don't fuck around in Texas is my
legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: As your lawyer, I highly advise you don't
fuck around in Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Behave yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So know the rules where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean you can dab in the
streets.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my point here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want people getting in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are like, hey, I can grow a bunch
of weed now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that fucked everybody here was you
can't grow weed in your backyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels like you should be able to,
but you definitely can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to kind of segue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get to the topic here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I saw somebody post a picture the
other day of their outdoor grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were like 24 plants and their
outdoor Colorado grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your limit is six, maybe 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got medical credentials.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you don't have credentials or medical
recommendations to two adults in a house.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can legally grow 12.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there's just one adult, if it's a
single adult property and only one
[SPEAKER_02]: person's getting mail there, the,
the, and you don't have a medical card to
[SPEAKER_02]: limit six.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do not post a photo of 13 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 post a picture of 11 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like don't even.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some of my friends out there
federally, like triple think about posting
[SPEAKER_02]: period because the powers, the beast to
like to fuck with us any way they can,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it can.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on your location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely double, triple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here in Colorado, it can fuck with
your child custody cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can fuck with your job.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can fuck with your livelihood or
banking ways you're banking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's sort of no end to the list
of ways we have come up with to screw with
[SPEAKER_02]: people in an attempt to get them to not
smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And during legalization, even here in
Colorado, where we really started
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just no, no attempt yet to go back
and go, we shouldn't fuck with people's
[SPEAKER_02]: schools, school funding options because
they got caught with pot or we shouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: kick them out of federal housing because
they're smoking pot or, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: test positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: We shouldn't take them off transplant
lists or threaten to take their children
[SPEAKER_02]: away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like all those things still happen even
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not to be Debbie down around the show,
but that's kind of what we're playing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can play safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that's your role, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that's what we brought you every
party needs a pooper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow, consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can open up a fucking storefront.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can advertise on the radio,
but there's nowhere really legal to go
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to go home.
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally checked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Virginia did go legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice shot to Virginia.
[SPEAKER_02]: The headline said it was squirrely and you
should read the article to understand it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's funny that they said
squirrely in an article.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hoping the reporter said the word
squirrely reporter, Mike, with the word
[SPEAKER_00]: squirrely on the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've rambled for a long fucking time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've promised the people a podcast here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be an editor seven to happen
into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, there are some new rules happening
in Colorado that are going to affect
[SPEAKER_00]: myself and possibly you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't shop as heavily as I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this may affect me and you in the
future.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, myself, the the people who wrote
the bill that we're talking about hope it
[SPEAKER_02]: affects everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's their goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the bill we're talking about,
if you'd like to read along at home
[SPEAKER_02]: listeners, you can look it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can Google this by just typing the
capital letters C.O.
[SPEAKER_02]: for Colorado and then H.B.
[SPEAKER_02]: for House Bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thirteen seventeen is the serial
number.
[SPEAKER_02]: So C.O.
[SPEAKER_02]: H.B.
[SPEAKER_02]: thirteen seventeen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's designed as a bill to add
restrictions and regulations to Colorado's
[SPEAKER_02]: medical marijuana program and marijuana
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: The anti-cannabis powers to be around the
country and here in Colorado have learned
[SPEAKER_02]: that the only two top talking points they
have that anyone still gives a fuck about
[SPEAKER_02]: are marijuana is way stronger now than it
was in the 60s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you should be afraid of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And teenagers getting a hold of cannabis
is especially bad now because it's super
[SPEAKER_02]: strong like we told you about a minute
ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Longtime listeners of this show will know
that I have rambled at length repeatedly
[SPEAKER_02]: about what nonsense both of those talking
points are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm happy to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, in a future show.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, House Bill thirteen seventeen,
with those two talking points in mind,
[SPEAKER_02]: made its way through the Colorado
legislature and was signed into law about
[SPEAKER_02]: a week ago by Governor Polis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the stuff I'm going to be talking
about takes place immediately or whenever
[SPEAKER_02]: they can figure out how to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because some of it's not immediately
possible in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: So under the new law, they're changing
medical marijuana rules, especially for
[SPEAKER_02]: people under the age of twenty one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now, before this bill in
Colorado, you can be a medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: patient at any age.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're twenty one or over, you just go
to one doctor, often a doctor that
[SPEAKER_02]: specializes in medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: You talk to that doctor and a doctor's
appointment and they fill out your
[SPEAKER_02]: paperwork.
[SPEAKER_02]: You send your paperwork into the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get a thing back on your phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, it's very easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all it takes to get your
medical marijuana card.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that's 18 and over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, 18 and up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a different group under 18
where you needed two doctors to sign off
[SPEAKER_02]: on your card.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most medical marijuana doctors didn't
want anything to do with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was this middle group of people
who were 18 to 21 who were too young to
[SPEAKER_02]: shop in rec stores, but old enough to shop
in medical stores who would get medical
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana cards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the bill supposes a large number of
those people were then retail selling
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis they purchased with their medical
card and cannabis concentrates to their
[SPEAKER_02]: high school friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they've come up with new rules
requiring anyone under 21 to go see two
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana doctors or not two marijuana
doctors, two doctors to sign their
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana paperwork.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've implemented a couple of other
rules that the physicians will have to
[SPEAKER_02]: meet, like reviewing previous doctor's
records, recommending dosage and potency
[SPEAKER_02]: limits, especially for patients under 21.
[SPEAKER_02]: My videos frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your video is frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sound perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just now froze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, as long as you guys as long as you
still get my audio, but I was blown out my
[SPEAKER_00]: dad, you just came right back to us blown
out my dad and I looked and I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: is he frozen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I that high?
[SPEAKER_02]: That works.
[SPEAKER_02]: I needed to take a breath anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're doing great.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot harder for under 18 year olds to
purchase cannabis concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the other things that freaked them
out was recreational patients can only buy
[SPEAKER_02]: eight grams of concentrates a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medical patients could buy 40.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was surprised to learn that the number
is 40.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was pretty sure it was like 50 something
because 28 plus 28.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where the limit comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've been at a shop that sells
me 56.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the limit should be noticed I said a
shop all of the articles that I've read
[SPEAKER_02]: recently have specified the old limit was
40.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was getting 56 at one spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Place that should have been the limit the
way I understand the way the laws written.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just literally 15 news articles in a
row said the old limit was 40.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the bill language even says the
old limit was 40.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's pretty clear by one of the other
provisions in this bill that people that
[SPEAKER_02]: understand Colorado's marijuana laws and
work kind of inside them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not involved really.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a bill written by anti cannabis
people and people they've managed to
[SPEAKER_02]: scare.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're requiring under 21 year olds to
go to two doctors.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've made it really hard to be a
cannabis doctor only.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trying to push so that anyone with
a medical marijuana card is getting that
[SPEAKER_02]: from their primary care physician or if
they're under 18 a primary care physician
[SPEAKER_02]: and a recommended specialist that already
has access to their whole medical history.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: This again, this I really need to stress
this listeners.
[SPEAKER_02]: This bill is not meant to do good or to
make better or to improve.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is meant to hamper, hinder and destroy
explicitly.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people behind this are gleeful on
Facebook over the death blow.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've served Colorado's medical
marijuana program.
[SPEAKER_02]: This bill started out as a potency cap at
15%.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get to that in a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're under 21, you've got to go
see two doctors.
[SPEAKER_02]: They made it way harder to be a medical
marijuana doctor in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're probably going to get incredibly
scarce as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're slowly going to start seeing
other physicians who don't specialize in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis being forced to learn and catch
up with the rest of us and then fill the
[SPEAKER_02]: gap that's created when the medical
marijuana doctors start disappearing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It changes the purchase limits for medical
marijuana period down to eight grams of
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrates per day.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're under 21, so you're between 18
and 21, because if your parents are
[SPEAKER_02]: shopping for you, if you're under 18 and
you can't go into the building,
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe those people could still get
full eight grams of concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're between the ages of 18 and
21, you'll be limited to just two per day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're an 18 year old with stomach
cancer, who's using concentrates as
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine, your life just got real fucking
shitty.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no other way to say it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't imagine if you had to fill your
prescription medicine in a day or two or
[SPEAKER_02]: three or four days.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had to go to the pharmacy six times
a month to get your medicine and have
[SPEAKER_00]: stomach cancer at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super unfunctional.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the point.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to make it hard and
unfunctional.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are the main changes to medical
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also want to one of the big ones that
I almost just forgot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bad Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to set up a statewide
medical marijuana tracking system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they want to add a function to our
tracking system metric that tracks
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis product from seed, state,
age or clone stage through moving out into
[SPEAKER_02]: the consumer world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like they track it to the dispensary
and then as the dispensary sells it,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's just a form that says they sold
that pound of weed, you know, three and a
[SPEAKER_02]: half grams at a time all day long until it
was gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want it set up so that it marks that
Jeff bought three grams on Monday and
[SPEAKER_02]: three more grams on Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I came in on Tuesday and bought four
grams and then seven grams on Sunday.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want it all specific to the patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that the state registry will kick out
an error at a retail level.
[SPEAKER_02]: If an 18 to 21 year old tries to store hop
and buy more than two grams per day.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also want it set up so that the
doctor's recommendation of you should have
[SPEAKER_02]: X amount of cannabis per dose,
X amount of doses per day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like when your other stuff,
it's in milligrams.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 50 milligrams in the morning by mouth
with food or whatever, or three times a
[SPEAKER_02]: day with just water.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want the same thing with marijuana or
cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also want a potency attachment
too, because one of the theories they've
[SPEAKER_02]: built into the bill is that the higher the
potency number, the more problematic it
[SPEAKER_02]: becomes consumption consequence wise.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people behind this bill have an
operating theory that cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrates cause schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like these aren't sane people.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them are very tragic figures.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can get into that too, but I kind of
want to stay focused on the bill before I
[SPEAKER_02]: get too slow and too 80 D off into the
corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the medical marijuana stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: The tracking program, super unfeasible
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The last time I worked with metric,
metric was not capable of doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was barely capable of doing what we're
asking it to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Asking it to track retail enough so that
the state database knows how many grams of
[SPEAKER_02]: medical marijuana everybody bought last
week is going to be really complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another state that actually does
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used to, they don't anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just changed that system to the,
I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they used to go by units and you were
allowed so many units per month and the
[SPEAKER_00]: state would know how many units you have
and it would be in your computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you shop, just like you would say,
Mike's got a hundred units and you'd buy
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it would take it out of your
units.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like a concentrate would be two units
and a flower gram would be a unit or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how they broke it down,
but.
[SPEAKER_02]: The folks behind this bill really hoped
this would kill medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's a big reason they don't
have any sort of tracking system for reg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or for recreational.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's just specifically targeted
on the med program.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're making it harder on doctors.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're making it harder on dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're making it harder on med grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole point is to squeeze the medical
industry until it just shutters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Colorado just has a recreational
industry because people needing cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine is bulletproof politically.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got support in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And 80s.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The anyone who spent any time working in
or around marijuana knows it's healing
[SPEAKER_02]: potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sanjay Gupta is an incredible example of
staunch prohibitionist who worked against
[SPEAKER_02]: us, spending time near us in having his
eyes open wide to the point where he was a
[SPEAKER_02]: major advocate for years with those weed
specials on CNN.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't know what I'm talking about,
please Google Sanjay Gupta weed specials.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's four or five hours of wonderful
television.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're unfamiliar with medical
marijuana, those will get you all caught
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some other parts of this bill limiting
medical purchasing down from 40 grams a
[SPEAKER_02]: day to eight is pretty brutal for a lot of
med patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also sets money aside to study cannabis
potency because you can't just give people
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrates and see what happens to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be wildly unethical according to
modern psychology and modern medical
[SPEAKER_02]: studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the DEA and NIDA won't allow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the odds that this money is used for
actual research is zero or maybe 1%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they'll probably pull articles and just
compile the findings from other articles
[SPEAKER_02]: where they tried to look at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody's really done the research,
which is funny because the original
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana research where they discovered
the THC and CBD molecule was done with
[SPEAKER_02]: hashish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the researcher has a lovely story
about going to the police station and
[SPEAKER_02]: picking up confiscated kilos and then
riding on a public bus back to the lab
[SPEAKER_02]: with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hashish and concentrates have been part
of marijuana research since the first day
[SPEAKER_02]: we started researching it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, what if we try to transport some
medical concentrates on the bus now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, hey, Mike, I'm just going to run
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would laugh really hard putting that in
the directions portion of a manifest.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be so funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Walk to bus stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get on bus 117.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ride to stop 74.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you guys that work metric.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know if this works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw somebody in the directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said planned route.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said quickest possible route or most
logical route or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just type that as their whole
travel guide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was my go to for the last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did manifest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it work for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I never had anybody complain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite thing, I submitted my MED
badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a thing that when you submit
it, it says, Hey, just because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: submitting your badge doesn't mean you're
relinquished of any crimes you may have
[SPEAKER_00]: committed while you had this badge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this isn't like you didn't just hit
safe by fucking tapping out of a game.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could still be fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great clause.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made sure I signed that little
stipulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, yeah, I just need this because
other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: No worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going to limit our concentrate
purchases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to ask, do you think that this is
just going to send people to the black
[SPEAKER_00]: market, the free market?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many words for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still say black black market.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get that the cannabis market is such a
weird space and the history of it is super
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's very different than other
illicit markets.
But yeah, I think that's a great point.
It's one of the reasons that we're doing
all this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other one is because,
um, in the late nineties in the time when
[SPEAKER_02]: we were really involved, it was small home
grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: In friends and associates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a reason that there weren't a
lot of bodies.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like we just stopped being
friends when somebody fucked up or we just
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't like that guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: or maybe somebody got beat up,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there weren't major shootouts over
turf and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it never fully went away.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just stopped having a point here in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's just so easy to hit the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have to call anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have to arrange anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: The odds that what we grew up in has a
major resurgence here is pretty slim.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what's likely to happen is it's
going to squeeze medical to death.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's going to be a slow turnover
of all of the places that have med and rec
[SPEAKER_02]: are slowly going to convert their med to
more rec.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the places that just have med are
going to be desperate as fuck to convert
[SPEAKER_02]: to rec.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because med still, I'm 99% sure,
requires patient sign-up.
[SPEAKER_02]: For plant counts.
[SPEAKER_02]: My medical program function knowledge is a
little rusty because I'm not even a
[SPEAKER_02]: MedCard holder for the first time in like
15 years right now because I've been so
[SPEAKER_02]: damn busy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit, I haven't even been on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've even let my MedCard lapse,
but I'm 99% sure medical dispensaries here
[SPEAKER_02]: still need patients to sign up with them
so that they can have a plant limit and
[SPEAKER_02]: grow it in their grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when medical marijuana doctors vanish,
they're going to be way hard up for
[SPEAKER_02]: patients starting in a few months because
patient numbers drop off every month.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like this bill was designed to kill
medical and it's probably going to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's frustrating.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was really surprised with how little the
industry pushed back on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as they got the potency cap pushed
to a potency study, they sat out the rest
[SPEAKER_02]: of the fight, which sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't hear much about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear a lot about a lot of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one was kind of quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like this one was kind of happened
late at night when I wasn't looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: The couple of times I brought it up
because there was a packaging requirement
[SPEAKER_02]: that was tied to this where they were
going to have all cannabis concentrates
[SPEAKER_02]: had to be sold in one 10th of a gram
containers, which would mean you could
[SPEAKER_02]: still go buy your eight grams,
but instead of eight drugs, you would have
[SPEAKER_02]: to buy 80 jars or they would have to
figure out a way to divvy up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's inside the jar into 10 easily
identifiable segments that got cut out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank God for an amendment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But instead they inserted like $3 million
in funding for an educational campaign to
[SPEAKER_02]: talk to youth about extracted THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another million a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: To keep that program going through 2024.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another $2 million for one of the local
universities to research cannabis potency
[SPEAKER_02]: and the effects of potent cannabis
products on humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another $1.7 million to create a reporting
system for coroners to report all kinds of
[SPEAKER_02]: violent deaths or anything but died of old
age.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want a talk screen run and those
results reported to a statewide database
[SPEAKER_02]: because the people behind this bill are
100% sure that if you smoke cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: you commit suicide later, especially if
you're dabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They write books about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go to conferences where they tell
each other about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's I spoke to Graham of
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we've been sitting here on zoom,
we've been on zoom for much longer than
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been recording this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've consumed a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: This jar is empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of want to go something I've never
done on a podcast on my show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it as a guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get up and go to my concentrate
location and acquire another jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have no desire to hurt myself or
other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking shenanigans.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bullshit is what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So between the ages of 12 and 30,
all of the crazy happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when you leave the house for
the first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when you discover who you are as a
person.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where you go on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck, I can't believe we lived through
that kind of shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Type adventures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the van started rolling type.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the age group.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look at all of the metrics,
like that age group dies young,
[SPEAKER_02]: the most like in that window, it's not 40
year olds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not 10 year olds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like 16 to 30.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's also when mental illness appears.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's also when other disorders like
anxiety, bipolar, obscenity, those can
[SPEAKER_02]: really come to a head in the late teens,
early twenties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing that happens then is
you start experimenting with narcotics and
[SPEAKER_02]: alcohol, tobacco, pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the big three sex, drugs and
rock and roll, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not the same if you don't do all
three.
[SPEAKER_02]: But got to go fast for a large part.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people behind this bill and the people
that make up the anti-cannabis movement
[SPEAKER_02]: are people who had loved ones who died
young and were using cannabis to some
[SPEAKER_02]: extent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before they died, some of these people
were clearly experiencing mental illness.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that you learn when you
study depression and mental illness and
[SPEAKER_02]: psychology is that when people are in a
state of mental anguish or anxiety,
[SPEAKER_02]: depression, you self-medicate with
anything you need your hands on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anyone who's known someone with mental
illness or depression, especially when
[SPEAKER_02]: that was emerging in them, they
self-medicate wildly because you think,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, I'm not depressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm tired.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you drink a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You start to be using caffeine.
[SPEAKER_02]: The caffeine starts taking its toll.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you start smoking pot or drinking at
night to take the edge off so you can
[SPEAKER_02]: unwind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that tends to make mental illness
worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's definitely a cycle that can
start when a young person starts suffering
[SPEAKER_02]: and starts self-medicating and then
eventually commits suicide.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look at it objectively from the
outside, you can see that, oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not an A leads to B leads to C thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all depression.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of the steps you're seeing aren't
steps.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not dominoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're symptoms that all come from the
middle thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you're up close, all you see is
the loss.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we were kids, you seek to place
blame.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we were kids, these people ended
up to some extent going from middle school
[SPEAKER_02]: to middle school to tell you not to smoke
crack or whatever it was of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: My kid died in a drunk driving accident.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do coke.
[SPEAKER_02]: My kid died, coked out in a car accident.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do heroin.
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite son who was a wrestler and a
star athlete died of heroin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they have online anti-pot groups that
they can get whatever from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these groups have been throwing
everything they can at the wall trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: see what sticks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only two things that get any
traction with anybody anymore are the
[SPEAKER_02]: potency argument and the think about the
kids argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: Save the children.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I was really disgusted to see
that this gained traction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was horrified when it got all the
sponsors it got.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was horrified with how quickly it moved
through the Colorado House and Senate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jared Polis is incredibly pro cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had a big signing event where the people
behind this bill went to the governor's
[SPEAKER_02]: mansion and hung out around him at the
signing table while he signed it and then
[SPEAKER_02]: got to take home the ceremonial pens and
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of that's just the pomp and
circumstance that goes with bill signing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ceremonial pens.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just like a lot of times they just
five of them get signed and you read about
[SPEAKER_02]: it in the news the next day.
[SPEAKER_02]: These five bills got signed into law.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's what they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no ceremony.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no ceremonial pens.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just the process being fulfilled
legally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the fact that there was a signing
ceremony and ceremonial pens was
[SPEAKER_02]: disturbing in its own right because that
pomp and circumstance isn't necessarily
[SPEAKER_02]: standard even though it is common.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to see a pro cannabis governor sign an
anti-cannabis bill that's only thinly
[SPEAKER_02]: veiled as a regulation bill was pretty
ugly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did we just lose video again?
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw you glitch and then wave.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good audio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The audio was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The audio stays good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm recording on a backup source as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm thinking trying to do this right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always thought that dude was on our team
and it was like, well, then when I read
[SPEAKER_00]: what he had done, I was like, wait,
but yeah, he did a couple of other things
[SPEAKER_00]: that confused me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't even want to talk too much
about politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know enough, but I feel like I
learned certain people because they
[SPEAKER_00]: represent us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm scrolling through the article on the
westward here just to make sure I'm paying
[SPEAKER_02]: all the points I need to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the paragraph right here is the
recreational marijuana industry has stayed
[SPEAKER_02]: largely neutral or silent on the bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: The medical marijuana community,
which means actual community members,
[SPEAKER_02]: they would have said industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm voiced the loudest resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over a hundred medical marijuana doctors
sent an opposition letter to the governor
[SPEAKER_02]: asking him to veto.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think the governor's veto would
have done anything because it looks like
[SPEAKER_02]: they really did have the votes to force it
through regardless.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's rough.
[SPEAKER_02]: This sets up a couple of studies that
because of the limitations in this policy
[SPEAKER_02]: and law, the study can only conclude that
concentrates are scary and we don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's going to be enough for
them to try to push concentrates out of
[SPEAKER_02]: the rec market in two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people behind these bills,
their goal is to cripple and to destroy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they know that they can't,
like if they just ran a straight up,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's repeal amendment 64 and go back to
prohibition.
But at the same time they're trying to get
at a point in time like that of the
[SPEAKER_02]: general public that they would get laughed
out of the fucking state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like maybe not even laughed, maybe run out
on a rail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, um, but.
[SPEAKER_02]: They found ways where they can get in on
the side conversation and they can bleed
[SPEAKER_02]: us dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of them was, let's keep adding
taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Until the, There's no money left to pay
the people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they got real close to doing it that
way and got stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's so many taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: They came up with the let's do the potency
bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: And two or three years ago, we were able
to just we hired all of the petition
[SPEAKER_02]: circulating companies and we made sure
they were otherwise occupied.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the anti-pop people were just straight
up about the fact that they didn't have a
[SPEAKER_02]: broad enough coalition to support to get
the signatures anyway without a hired
[SPEAKER_02]: company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this year, they found a way to
get the legislators to push it forward
[SPEAKER_02]: through them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they didn't need any signatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got a couple of sponsors to take
their their language and tweak it a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit and throw it forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the original bill would have killed
the concentrate industry completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things you were telling me the industry
down for a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the things you said the past few
months had me worried.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like clutching my dab rig going,
hey, wait, but I mean, what are they going
[SPEAKER_00]: to do with my dabs?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's we're in one of those weird
fluxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, historically, society makes a
bunch of progress and things get newer and
[SPEAKER_02]: better and more interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a period of conflict happens like
an 18 month pandemic that shut everything
[SPEAKER_02]: down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then things go conservative for a
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it sometimes it's 10 years and it
usually the pendulum swings the other way
[SPEAKER_02]: for a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go back and pull some like WAP
level lyrics from the 1930s because the
[SPEAKER_02]: 20s and 30s had a big sexual revolution
that was so far repressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had to fucking reinvent that shit in
the 60s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's over here making WAP references a
couple of months late, but I'm still
[SPEAKER_00]: impressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Life's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just this feels like something we're
going to backslide on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really need the community to give a
shit about this because it's not a good
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The powers that be are pissed that they
can't take away our voting rights because
[SPEAKER_02]: we like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're pissed that they can't take away
our property because we like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really pissed that we've made an
industry out of buying selling,
[SPEAKER_02]: growing and consuming cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they can find a way to put the
genie back in the bottle and go back to
[SPEAKER_02]: kicking doors in because you might have a
quarter ounce of weed in the table,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're gonna.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can't let them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is them trying the best they know
how right now to backslide.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get online and look for like
Project Sam or Smart Approaches to
[SPEAKER_02]: Marijuana talking about this bill in
Colorado, their language is explicit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado's experiment with legalization
has failed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Full stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Proof of that is this regulation bill
where we're finally going to hold those
[SPEAKER_02]: evil marijuana people accountable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we finally fought and hard won
regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: They act like we don't have any rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: They act like it's people grown in their
basement and selling it on street corners
[SPEAKER_02]: to toddlers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get away with it because people like
me have two kids now and we don't make it
[SPEAKER_02]: to all the meetings anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm over here running a podcast and
not doing my job, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mike, how do we to start wrapping up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we've been going for long enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we make sure that doesn't happen
like this to us in the future here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado, but in places where they are
working on legalization and building their
[SPEAKER_00]: foundation, how did we miss this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do we make sure stuff like this
doesn't keep happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what can we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get some final moments from
some, some Mike's minutes, if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this happened because the industry
grew complacent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, part of our legal industry has chased
people like me out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we're annoying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we remind the boss that federal law
says breaks are a fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, we call the boss when it's 105 degrees
in the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you tell me, Hey buddy, you're driving
too fast with all the dab rig and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: in the cup holder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why, that's why we call him white
Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, that's his fucking job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like.
[SPEAKER_02]: The boss don't like it when you tell them
you won't skirt the law for the same
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just don't like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't like it when you call them on
the shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what advocates do is we see
something that's wrong and it pisses us
[SPEAKER_02]: off and we stand up and speak about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it takes a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes a lot of dedication.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes an endless amount of study and
reading.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I mean, just knowing this bill was a
thing, you have to at least check the news
[SPEAKER_02]: regularly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you wouldn't even heard about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't know without you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It, uh, when I asked.
[SPEAKER_02]: When, um, the packaging requirement for
hash still said concentrates had to be
[SPEAKER_02]: served in 10th of a gram containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: When that was still direct language in the
bill, I asked around every time I was in a
[SPEAKER_02]: shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: You all hear about the regulation bill
that come and know, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's, it's really fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should learn about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things is they're gonna require
packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, they wouldn't, that doesn't make any
sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would hurt us.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wouldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the take everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And getting people to understand that the
world don't like us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matter of fact, most of them grew up
sitting in circle talking about how much
[SPEAKER_02]: they ought to hate us, to shun us,
to chase us out of the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still companies that are big mad
that we all smoke weed now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they want us to pass a drug test,
they're going to have to pay us a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: because we'll take a little more shitty
job because we get to smoke weed there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, you were allowed afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, we don't tell you what to do at
home.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as the boss starts talking to you
about what to do in your off hours,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's time to find a new boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or create a job of your own.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they don't like that they've lost that
bit of control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of industries have their hands
tied because in the full prohibition days,
[SPEAKER_02]: we used to pay people to think up ways to
try to convince me and Jeff not to smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they were like, you can't ever hold
a license operating every equipment or
[SPEAKER_02]: driving a truck or using a forklift or
working in the meatpacking industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: All those fucking people have to get drug
tested constantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fast food employees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they got insurance companies to give
the companies big discounts if they would
[SPEAKER_02]: just drug test their employees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one by one, all of these industries
got a little thumb on their neck saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: we've got a drug test.
[SPEAKER_02]: And places like Colorado, the company's
forced to choose between eating that
[SPEAKER_02]: insurance discount or drug testing their
people and not having to work force.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just people got to stay vigilant and
stay on top of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we really need to start electing
better people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Predictably, the sponsors of this bill,
one of the main sponsors is a
[SPEAKER_02]: pediatrician.
[SPEAKER_02]: A pediatrician.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's talking about 18 year olds,
cannabis habits.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a pediatrician.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think her take on this is?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think her patients are honest with
her?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think 18 year olds are honest with
their dad?
[SPEAKER_02]: I fucking wasn't right after it's like,
you smell like cigarettes and I can see
[SPEAKER_02]: them on the floor over there where they
fought your pants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You sure you don't smoke?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: I certainly don't smoke weed doc.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll tell my mom, I can't have her now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they fear monger this shit in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really going to fuck with the
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: The that potency study, it's set up in
this bill so that a commission is formed
[SPEAKER_02]: to do the study.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then whatever recommendations they
make, the MED and the Department of
[SPEAKER_02]: Revenue have to figure out how to make
them a rule.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if they come back saying our
research shows that anything above 15% THC
[SPEAKER_02]: is considered a hard drug, which if they
just Google, where does the Netherlands
[SPEAKER_02]: stop caring about cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's 15%.
[SPEAKER_02]: THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden we've got that rule
here where anything above 15% is a no go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's that could happen in other
states.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's one state on the East
Coast that has a potency cap already.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's 60% for concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you, what, what do you,
so what, if you make a concentrate that's
[SPEAKER_00]: over 60%, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to throw some other shit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the, with what though?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even want to know what that's
gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, I said I was going to give you a
Mike's moment and I gave you like an hour
[SPEAKER_02]: and a half minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that's what I was going to get out
of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were going to try to wrap this up half
an hour folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for listening to the rambles folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being on the show,
but also bro, you were saying how much
[SPEAKER_00]: dedication, reading time and energy it
takes to be an advocate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because without you laying all that
groundwork, I wouldn't be able to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't be able to put the fucking
seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the greatest way I could put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need you out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need more guys like you out there doing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, if you are curious on how to
be active, how to get involved in the
[SPEAKER_00]: political side, not everybody's a grower,
not everybody's a podcaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to do some behind the scenes
work and get legalization going to where
[SPEAKER_00]: you are, get it, go in contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mikey will help you out, teach you how to
do all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give you some tips and tricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a busy dude, but he will respond to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do promise that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can totally stay anonymous doing
this also it's harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in none of my advocacy has anyone ever
checked my ID.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could fully be any sort of pen name
you want as long as it's believable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And letters to the editor have a lot of
weight to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The powers of the beast still really like
newspapers and they don't have an ability
[SPEAKER_02]: to check who's at the end of the email
either.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just submit an email, go to
Outlook.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can create a new Outlook email in
about four seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can be anybody you want to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the more people speaking out,
the better it is for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike is feeding the trolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more people, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's definitely it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a lot of people that are
sitting around smoking, listening to the
[SPEAKER_00]: show, loving the show, uh, send an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're, if you're working on some sort
of legalization where you live,
[SPEAKER_00]: send an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done enough for the political
talking about centered emails and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike, I want to thank you for hanging out,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I need to go get some more
concentrates out of my car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concentrate supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for us to burrow out for a few
minutes and just talk off camera here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you don't get enough time to adult and
hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to, uh, abuse some of that
privilege.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, thank you again for hanging out,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to remind people how to stalk
you on social media just because they all
[SPEAKER_00]: have ADD and they already forgot what you
said at the start of the show.
