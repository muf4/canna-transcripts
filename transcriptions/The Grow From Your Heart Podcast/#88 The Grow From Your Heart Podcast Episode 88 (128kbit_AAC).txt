[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for episode number 88 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a veteran dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who is
[SPEAKER_00]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call me Ross DeJeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I want to send a huge thank you
shout out to the Mystic Roots band for
[SPEAKER_00]: letting me use their music on my show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to Kat, Coot, and the entire
Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, you guys are listening to a
song called The Doggy Dub off of the
[SPEAKER_00]: album, The Constant Struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you support the Mystic Roots and
check out the album, The Constant
[SPEAKER_00]: Struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite album from them is called Cali
High.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everyone's having a great week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm coming to you on a Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is 710 in the evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually about 715 because you know
what I did at 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a nice little 710 session.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys all had a nice 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope wherever you are, whatever you're
doing, I hope you're loading up a bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're twisting up a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're packing up the vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're eating an edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're heating up the nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're taking a dab with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that in some way, shape,
or form, you are consuming some type of
[SPEAKER_00]: high grade, high quality, super delicious
dank cannabis products with me right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to whoever is smoking,
token, dabbing, eating some edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys are joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it's organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it's clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it's fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a couple of things I want to
talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to take a minute to give a huge
thank you to my friend, Sonny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sonny sometimes listens to this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to thank Revay, a couple other
people that you guys probably have never
[SPEAKER_00]: heard of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I especially want to thank Donovan
McNeely, Dan Lazzarini, Kenny Nicholson,
[SPEAKER_00]: Wayne de Herrera.
[SPEAKER_00]: The list just goes on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll tell you what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, a couple of weeks ago,
a good friend of mine by the name of Brian
[SPEAKER_00]: Ritchie, he passed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: He left this earth and he left us a little
saddened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian was a great musician.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian is probably, let's see, Brian was
probably close to 40 years older than me,
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty close, 35 to 40 years older than
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I met Brian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a musician just starting out and I
was playing in a club and Brian saw me
[SPEAKER_00]: play and he said, young man, you've got a
gift and my band needs a drummer and I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: like you to play with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, this old guy approaches me
and asked me to play.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of thought, I don't want to play
with a bunch of old guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a young rock star, but for some reason
I did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something in my heart said, you should go
play with these old guys and see what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until I played with them, I was not a
drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a guy with a drum set that was
hitting drums with my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian and the band I joined with Brian
turned me into a musician.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not a musician until that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian gave me musical career advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian gave me stage advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian taught me a lot about being a
professional musician.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian took me out of the bar mentality of
playing as a bar musician, just playing
[SPEAKER_00]: for free beer, trying to be a rock star.
[SPEAKER_00]: He put me in the mentality and mindset of
a working drummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will never forget that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm always grateful to Brian Ritchie
for the, what did he see in me?
[SPEAKER_00]: He had confidence in me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had faith in me and he saw that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he put me behind the drums in his band
when I wasn't ready and let me earn my
[SPEAKER_00]: position there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I worked hard to be the drummer that
he needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been going on for a long time
about it, but Brian, I miss you bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for what you did to my musical
career.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for what you did to my mindset as a
musician.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what I'm getting to is Saturday,
we threw a giant party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian didn't want a funeral because he
didn't want sadness, but I thought that it
[SPEAKER_00]: was my duty to throw a party for the man
and get all of our favorite mutual friends
[SPEAKER_00]: and musicians together in one room and
play one big jam and one last hurrah for
[SPEAKER_00]: our friend Brian.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I organized an event in my friend
Sonny's house.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a, a large jam space with like a
large jam room.
[SPEAKER_00]: His house is like a club.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a small club attached to the back
of his house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I made a Facebook event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent out a few phone calls, a few
invites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got our old band together, came and
jammed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another band that Brian was in came and
jammed and a bunch of Brian's old friends
[SPEAKER_00]: came and played music.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a potluck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to George Samaras.
[SPEAKER_00]: He brought a lot of great goodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout to everybody who attended the
party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to everybody who played at
the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout to Danielle for helping me
organize the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: This party meant a lot to me and it was a
complete success and I am totally
[SPEAKER_00]: satisfied and grateful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to share all of it with you
guys and give a big thank you to
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone can hear it all at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys are listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll, we'll move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to, I don't want to ramble
about this party too much, but I was super
[SPEAKER_00]: excited and I feel like I wanted to thank
everybody on the podcast publicly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to know that I can put together
a party like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only had about four or five days to
organize and I got about 80 people in this
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was really proud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really happy to honor Brian that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian, I miss you bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few weeks ago, well, it's been ongoing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the past few weeks, we have talked
about a raid that happened at a Santa Ana,
[SPEAKER_00]: California dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you guys a little update.
[SPEAKER_00]: These cops raided a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They treated all of the people in the
dispensary like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the dispensary was emptied of people,
they took down all the cameras and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they began to, they proceeded to destroy
this dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They broke the TVs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They broke the security systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They caused damage to the safes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They caused a lot of damage to the
displays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these police officers had the
audacity to eat edibles on camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: There happened to be another hidden camera
in the building that was recording that
[SPEAKER_00]: the cops didn't know about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were caught talking mad shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They shouldn't have been saying they were
eating edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were playing darts and they were
acting like assholes on camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have been caught.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dispensary's lawyer discovered the
video and filed a lawsuit against specific
[SPEAKER_00]: law enforcement officers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here is where we are today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an article that I found on reason
.com written by Jacob Solem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the headline says suspended cops say
video of them eating marijuana edibles
[SPEAKER_00]: during a raid violated their privacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sub headline is Santa Ana officers
want to stop their department from using
[SPEAKER_00]: the footage to investigate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go ahead and read you the
article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, remember the Santa Ana California
cops who were caught on video munching on
[SPEAKER_00]: what seems to be cannabis infused
chocolate bars after raiding an unlicensed
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana dispensary in May?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Orange County register reports that
three officers who were suspended after
[SPEAKER_00]: the incident are trying to stop the Santa
Ana police department from using the
[SPEAKER_00]: footage in its internal investigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Among other things, their lawsuit argues
that the officers thought they had
[SPEAKER_00]: disabled all of the security cameras at
Sky High Holistic and therefore had a
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonable expectation of privacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cops complained that the dispensary
never got their permission to record them
[SPEAKER_00]: as they searched the premises.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these cops are trying to stop this
video from being used in court because
[SPEAKER_00]: they were illegally recorded because since
they had destroyed all of the security
[SPEAKER_00]: cameras, they therefore had a reasonable
expectation of privacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that means that if I break into your
house and you film me, fuck your film
[SPEAKER_00]: because I had an expectation of privacy
while I broke into your house and stole
[SPEAKER_00]: all your shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what these cops are saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a two way street.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that a rule works just for
cops that doesn't work for civilians,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: These cops are trying to pull some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep reading here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, all police personnel present had
a reasonable expectation that their
[SPEAKER_00]: conversations were no longer being
recorded and the undercover officers
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling that they were safe to do so
removed their masks, says the complaint,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was filed in Orange County Superior
Court.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without the illegal recordings,
there would have been no internal
[SPEAKER_00]: investigation of any officer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under California law, all parties to a
confidential communication must consent to
[SPEAKER_00]: being recorded, but that rule does not
apply when the parties to the
[SPEAKER_00]: communication may reasonably expect that
the communication may be overheard or
[SPEAKER_00]: recorded.
[SPEAKER_00]: In an interview with the register,
Sky High's lawyer, Matthew Papas,
[SPEAKER_00]: noted that police routinely use
surveillance camera video against
[SPEAKER_00]: suspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty pathetic for police to say if
we don't like something that it can be
[SPEAKER_00]: used, that it can't be used as evidence,
he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: They knew they were on video just because
they missed one camera doesn't make it
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we all agree here that this is
complete bullshit because if you or I were
[SPEAKER_00]: caught doing something on a film,
no matter how that film was made,
[SPEAKER_00]: that film would be used against us in a
court of law.
[SPEAKER_00]: That film would probably be edited by the
opposing lawyers to make us look like a
[SPEAKER_00]: pile of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that this videotape should
definitely be used in a court of law.
[SPEAKER_00]: These people, in my opinion, they
illegally fucking attacked, if you know
[SPEAKER_00]: more about the story, these people
illegally singled out this dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that this video is used in
court.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, there are bigger problems in
America than we knew about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give a huge shout out to
reason.com and also a big shout out to
[SPEAKER_00]: Jacob Solem.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, my friend Fred Garvin
recently sent me an email or was a
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook message and it said, I don't
remember exactly what it said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to kind of misquote him
ridiculously, but he said, Hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff, you used to do a bunch of grow
lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was what the show is about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And recently you were not doing grow
lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fred, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've responded to you on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: I addressed this on the last podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely agree with you, Fred.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to get back to the grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's what I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a fat dab and then I
will be right back and we will talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: the importance of pH in your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hang on for just one second.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm going to take a dab,
maybe get a drink and I will be right
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I am back after a
couple of dabs and I am feeling great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's time to talk about pH a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a few notes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to skim through these
without sounding like I'm reading too
[SPEAKER_00]: much, but I needed some notes to keep
myself on track because this has a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers and a lot of important things that
we need to pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Properly adjusting the pH of your nutrient
solution can solve a lot of problems and
[SPEAKER_00]: it can greatly improve the quality of your
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still do a little bit of consulting and
I really see a lot of people overlooking
[SPEAKER_00]: the pH of their nutrient solution and how
important it is to adjust the pH of their
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient solution before they feed their
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys have a lot of problems in their
gardens that look like nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see them trying to correct nutrient
deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of times a pH imbalance will
look like it'll camouflage itself as maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: a CalMag problem or maybe a phosphorus
overload.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of times it's just a simple pH
problem that could have been solved by
[SPEAKER_00]: adjusting the pH of your nutrient solution
before you fed it to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people will talk about soil pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are going to talk about
different areas of pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm going to talk about is the pH
balance of your nutrient solution whether
[SPEAKER_00]: it be soil or hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're working in soil, the optimum pH
range for your soil garden is about 5.5 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were working in hydro, your optimum
range is going to be somewhere between 5.8
[SPEAKER_00]: and 6.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you keep hearing me say that we need
to be within a certain pH range.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be ideal to find a certain number
and stick with it is what most folks would
[SPEAKER_00]: think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason we need a pH range is
because some nutrients that we're feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: our plants, some of the elements that our
plants are trying to absorb are available
[SPEAKER_00]: at certain pH levels and some are
available at different pH levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to pick like in soil,
nitrogen is available.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pretty much suck up nitrogen at
any point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iron is more available on the lower side
of the pH scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 3.5 range, the 3.5 to about 6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: 7.5 is where you're going to pick up iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you get any higher on the pH range,
you stop absorbing the iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we're going to look at calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcium doesn't absorb very well in the
5.0 range, but it does start picking up at
[SPEAKER_00]: 5.5 to 6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can really absorb calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you go out toward the 7.5 range,
you stop picking up calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these nutrients have a window where the
pH is ideal for the plant to absorb each
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have found that in soil,
somewhere between 5.5 and 6.5 is when all
[SPEAKER_00]: of these nutrients become available at the
same time ideally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in hydro, like we said earlier,
it's 5.8 to 6.2 where these nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: become available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me tell you that the graph on the
hydro side is much smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a much more narrow window of
nutrient availability due to pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's a lot to absorb,
but once this clicks in, it'll definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: make sense to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me try to explain it like this a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's really hot outside, you don't
want hot cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it's really cold outside,
you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it's really cold outside,
you don't want ice cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it's warm outside, you want ice
cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we got to do, we got to find that
perfect day where you can have hot cocoa
[SPEAKER_00]: for breakfast and you can have ice cream
for lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're trying to do for the
plants by finding the perfect pH range.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to find that optimum spot
where they're in the mood for all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients we're feeding them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now we should probably talk
about what pH actually is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stands for.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH means potential hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's written with a lowercase p and a
capital H.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what pH is, is the measure of acid to
alkalinity in our nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH is measured on a scale of zero to 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zero is the most acidic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven is neutral, which means there is an
equal concentration of hydrogen and
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroxyl ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 14 is pure alkali.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's measured on what is called a,
yeah, I always fuck this word up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only have to say it in this instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a logarithmic scale, which means that
every one point increase or decrease in pH
[SPEAKER_00]: reflects a 10-fold change in acid or
alkaline.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a solution that's pH five,
that solution is 10 times more acidic than
[SPEAKER_00]: a solution that is pHed at six.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got something that's pHed at
four, it's going to be 1,000 times more
[SPEAKER_00]: acidic than a solution that's pHed at six.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind when you guys are
using your pH pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that we'll talk about
here in just a little bit, using your pH
[SPEAKER_00]: pen and your pH meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be really on the money when
you're adjusting your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you found that range that your plants
really like, you're going to want to try
[SPEAKER_00]: to set it right about there all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're using soil, somewhere within
that five, eight to six, five,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're in hydro, somewhere in that
five, six to six, three range,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to want to get your pH set
and then keep an eye on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then pay attention to where the
plants, each strain is going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: little different, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to where each strain likes
that fucking pH set and try to get it
[SPEAKER_00]: there every time and take notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind that point one on there
is a huge difference in your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't just say, I'm close enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get it close.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk about how to adjust the pH
and measure that here pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also you guys keep in mind,
if you're running hydro, your pH is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to change possibly every day because
you're going to have nutrients absorbed by
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have water evaporate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are going to be so many things that
happen causing your pH to change that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to have to be on that in
hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: In soil, you're just going to mix up the
bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end, before you feed it to the
plants, you will test it and then you will
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually seems like I'm getting to the
part where I should start explaining how
[SPEAKER_00]: to pH test your water and then how to
correct the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into that a little bit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I would, if you're mixing a hydro
kit, go ahead and mix it in your
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir, fill it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gosh, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill up your res with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you normally do it to the
recommended amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got a 25 gallon res, go ahead and
do 25 gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing a hydro kit, if you're
doing soil and you do five gallon buckets
[SPEAKER_00]: or you got a big res, fill that up however
you normally would with the amount you
[SPEAKER_00]: normally would.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then mix in your nutrients just like you
normally would.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give a shout out to my buddy,
John.
[SPEAKER_00]: He taught me something and I don't know
how valid this is, but it made sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: John says, if you're using potassium,
silicates, pour that in your water very
[SPEAKER_00]: first.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a good sound reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day we'll get John on the show and he
can explain why.
[SPEAKER_00]: John says, pour your potassium silicate
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you're going to use CalMag,
do your CalMag next and then do all of
[SPEAKER_00]: your other nutrients after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: His reasoning made sense and I don't want
to try to butcher the reason that he told
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one day we'll get John on the show to
talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a listener and you have a good
example of why and you can explain it,
[SPEAKER_00]: send me an email and I would like to see
what you're thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see if somebody else is on the
same page as my buddy, John.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fill your reservoir, mix your nutrients
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your potassium silicate first,
then do your CalMag, then do the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: your nutrients however you wish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then now is the time when you need to use
a pH pen or some type of pH meter or a pH
[SPEAKER_00]: probe and you need to stick that into this
nutrient solution and you need to see what
[SPEAKER_00]: the display says, what the number reads on
the display.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't afford a pH pen or a pH
meter, you can use an aquarium test kit to
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you what the pH is.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell them at the aquarium shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably pick it up at Walmart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used in an aquarium environment to
tell you what the pH of your aquarium
[SPEAKER_00]: water would be so that you don't kill your
fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll do the exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just testing for pH here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff isn't going to go into your
nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll take some water out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, you'll dip this strip into the
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even remember how to use the
reagent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit, it's been that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put some water on it and then you drop
these chemicals on it and it shows you
[SPEAKER_00]: what color it is and you measure it up to
the color and if it's like real blue,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you're the wrong way and if it's real
red, you're the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to get kind of in the middle,
but those test strips, they're kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, you can tell by my description.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I haven't used it in years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'll never use it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get yourself a good pH pen or a pH meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pens are way easier to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not drop your pen in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be toast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your pen calibrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know how to calibrate it,
take it to your local grow shop and they
[SPEAKER_00]: will probably calibrate it for you and
after the third or fourth time,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll get tired of doing it and they
will teach you how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go ask them how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll calibrate your pH pen for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always keep, no matter what type of pH pen
you're using, always keep the probe,
[SPEAKER_00]: the tip, that white part in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always keep that wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's something to remember with a pH
pen, a pH tester, a pH probe, other than
[SPEAKER_00]: the reagent.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using the expensive,
any kind of pen that you dip in the water,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it dries, it dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the thing to remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it dries, it dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your pH pen wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it calibrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it clean and keep it handy all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I myself, I use the Blue Lab 3-in-1 combo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a pH meter, a PPM meter,
and a temperature gauge on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's called a thermometer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 3-in-1 combo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little pricey.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't afford that, get yourself
those yellow Milwaukee's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to the grocery store and you
look for a pH pen, you'll see the yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: Milwaukee pH meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thing's a piece of shit, but it will
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll do what you need done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend a better one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can afford a more expensive,
higher quality pH meter, I would go for
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but that little yellow Milwaukee piece
of shit will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will die on you soon, so be prepared to
buy another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get the next upgraded one,
whatever it is, do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I like Blue Lab products.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy John was telling me he likes
another brand for some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stick with the Blue Lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You stick the meter in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You fill up your reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mix your nutrients in the proper
order.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be at about room temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, you don't want your water too
hot or too cold because that will
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely affect the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it at room temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe set it in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's coming out of the faucet too hot
or too cold, go set it in your grow room
[SPEAKER_00]: for a little while so that it's the same
temperature as your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then mix your nutrients into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then put your pH meter in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to show a number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, most municipal tap water comes
out, depending on where you are,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's between eight and nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will change seasonally, you guys,
or when your local water company cleans
[SPEAKER_00]: their pipes or does some flushing or
changes chemicals that they want to use,
[SPEAKER_00]: or it'll be seasonal for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention because in the summer and in
the winter, I can tell a huge difference
[SPEAKER_00]: in my water quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Test your water once in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pour water out of the faucet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it get to room temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stick your pH probe in there and see what
it is occasionally just for fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should always be testing everything
that's going into your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always curious about what's going into
my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mix your stuff up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the hell was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix your stuff up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stick your pH pen in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to show you a number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, you're close.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've mixed your nutrients,
you're hardly ever going to need pH up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to put pH up in there,
you probably are mixing your nutrients too
[SPEAKER_00]: strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably using something you
shouldn't be using.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably did something wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some instances where your pH
will drop really low.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay, but you're going to need to
bring it back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't happen very frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you mix up your nutrients,
you're probably going to be about 7.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need to get that down
closer to the 6.5 range if you're in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running hydro, you want to get
that down closer to the 6.0 area,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way you're going to want to do that is
slowly, very slowly add your pH down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't get this shit in your eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get it on your skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're new at this and you're
intimidated, or if you're a clumsy fucker,
[SPEAKER_00]: put on some gloves and put on some
protective goggles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a friend who's in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't say his name because I don't want
to embarrass you, but my friend Jason,
[SPEAKER_00]: he splashed some pH down into his eye just
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said he got a small drop of pH in his
eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said he went completely blind in that
eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said it was so excruciating that he
couldn't open the other eye, and he had to
[SPEAKER_00]: use Siri on his iPhone to call 911 to come
to his house and help him in his grow
[SPEAKER_00]: because he couldn't fucking see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put yourself in that kind of
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a clumsy fuck, wear some
goggles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're a pro, it might be a good
idea to wear some safety goggles or
[SPEAKER_00]: something when you're mixing this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH adjusters can really, really mess
with your eyes and your skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they get on you and get in your eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pour a little bit of pH down in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would start with five to 10 milliliters.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's five milliliters in a five gallon
bucket is probably enough to drop your pH
[SPEAKER_00]: down where you need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drop that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shake it up real good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your pH meter back in there and see
what you're testing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to get it right on the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to fuck up a couple
of batches.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have to use pH up and down so
many times that you just don't even want
[SPEAKER_00]: to use it because all the shit that you've
just added to your solution and you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: too much pH up and too much pH down in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to just pour that out
and start over, but don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you're going to learn you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how you are going to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add your pH up, add your pH down,
whichever you need to do and then test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've got it right where you want
it, go ahead and pour that water into your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a soil garden, if it's a hydro
garden, go ahead and start turning on the
[SPEAKER_00]: res and get it going or the pumps or
whatever you got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many different ways to do
hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I'm learning hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say that this lesson for pH
is pretty much wrapped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've covered all of my bullet
points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that your local water will
change and you should check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the kind of shit that you should
worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your local water is going to change
frequently and there's nothing that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can do about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to just be on top of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way that you can really control
your water is if you set up a reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: osmosis machine and you start cleaning
everything out of all of your water and
[SPEAKER_00]: starting fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be a whole other lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will try to find a water expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were listening and you're an expert
on water and water quality for a grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: you let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll bring you on the show and you can
teach us all about water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot about the plant, but there
are so many niche areas that people have
[SPEAKER_00]: perfected like our buddy Sean's got
organics figured out and I seem to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder in the group and then Spence is
the hatch guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are just so many small branches of
this that we've got figured out that each
[SPEAKER_00]: person does their own little as I'm going
to try to get a water guy on here for you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys and we'll talk about water quality
and what you should be looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could probably be just a segment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I was going to branch off and say,
dude, I have been learning hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking to my buddy John that
works with me at the spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the hydro master.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be learning so much hydro in a
crash course here in the next few months
[SPEAKER_00]: that you guys are going to learn hydro
with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will learn a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will start sharing the hydro talk with
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're building the most killer grow
facility at the spot dispensary in Pueblo
[SPEAKER_00]: West Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, there are over 100 lights in
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are four flowering rooms broken
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have 24 to 26 lights per room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a really nice veg area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are running 50 foot long flood and
drain tables that we fill up about 150
[SPEAKER_00]: gallons worth of water for a rez.
[SPEAKER_00]: We mix 150 gallons worth of newts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pump that into the table at one end.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shoots all the way to the other end of
the table, goes into a drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a pump, a really snazzy pump,
the quality they use at SeaWorld,
[SPEAKER_00]: shoots all of that water through 50 feet
of tubing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's two inch or three inch PVC
all the way back to the other end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it dumps it back into the table and
just keeps recirculating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then under each plant, then we have,
I can't really tell you too much about how
[SPEAKER_00]: we do the plant sites because that's kind
of a proprietary thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got each plant is designated its own
site and it's in a rockwool cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Underneath each rockwool cube and plant
site, there is a ring shooting a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen up underneath these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're feeding from the bottom and the
rockwool is waking it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we may, we're not sure if we want to
do this yet, but there may be a drip line
[SPEAKER_00]: put in to top feed all of the plants so
that we can drip that nutrient solution
[SPEAKER_00]: into the rockwool cube from the top and
then just let the root hang into that
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygenated water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you guys, I'm learning so damn much
about hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have built, we have built, I can't say I
built.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been involved in building a huge
hydro environment and I have learned so
[SPEAKER_00]: much without even putting plants in there
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are almost ready for plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be pulling harvest out of there in
no time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like we are so ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting stoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can tell just by the tone of my
voice that I'm fucking excited about the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow with the spot dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Dave and Robert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for giving me the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also a big shout out to the guys I've
been working with, my grow crew,
[SPEAKER_00]: my construction crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to John, big shout out to
Joe and a super shout out to Jaime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love all you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for helping me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for supporting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for seeing the vision and thanks
for being a good team.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big ridiculous shout out right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I got that one off my chest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I want to thank you for
listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like it's almost time to wrap up
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since you've listened to this far,
I'm going to do this to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast was of course brought to you
by my good friends at Hygril Winter
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing Supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hygril does have two locations to serve
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a Denver store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on 60th Street.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Pueblo location on 618 East 4th
Street in beautiful Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out Hygril for competitive pricing
and a great selection of indoor growing
[SPEAKER_00]: supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, when you're at Hygril and you're
checking out, tell them that you listen to
[SPEAKER_00]: the Grow From Your Heart podcast and they
will give you commercial pricing on your
[SPEAKER_00]: entire purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll save you a bunch of bucks,
which is always a good thing because money
[SPEAKER_00]: is expensive these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No more ads, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't do any more ads.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go ahead and wrap up the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, now that the show is over,
make sure you go to iTunes.

go visit the Grimy Gatsby since we can't
[SPEAKER_00]: get you to come down to Pueblo.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do a podcast with Damsel in Colorado
Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we get the Zoom H6, we'll get a lot of
shit going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that's all I got for you
today, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you follow me on Instagram.

[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of great shit to check out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, I want to give a big shout
out to my ninja Spence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, take a fat dab and
give your mom a hug for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kiss.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't try this at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leave your parents' smoke alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talking about the green.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indoor, outdoor, sing green.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Weed,
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we are in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: The place we plant the indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Proposition 215.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a medical need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You call it marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Jamaica, we call it ganja.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Weed, weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hemp me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hemp me.
[SPEAKER_02]: My ganja bag is empty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hemp me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hemp me.
[SPEAKER_02]: My ganja bag should be plenty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Proposition 215.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: She needs the weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, she really needs the weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Weed, weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love weed.

[SPEAKER_02]: Love the weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Raise your hand if you love weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Weed, weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Weed, weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Weed, weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love the weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love the weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love the weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mouse, I've just smoked his tash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I love my weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Weed song.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ha, ha, ha.
