[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back, Podcast World.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode 866 of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've got another fun episode
lined up for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: In today's podcast, I'm going to give away
free seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk more about those free seeds
later on in today's show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get too far, I do want to remind
you that the New Year's sale has begun at
[SPEAKER_01]: ireadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check ireadirect.com for
current New Year's pricing and inventory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't forget that all seed orders over
$100 do come with free shipping.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to waste too much time with
advertising here at the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's work our way into the question and
answer portion of today's podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a website.
[SPEAKER_01]: That website is ireadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the top of that website, there's a row
of tabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those tabs does say grow help or
grow questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you click on that tab, you can send me
a grow question.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I read your grow question here on the
podcast, I will send you a coupon code for
[SPEAKER_01]: a free pack of seeds at ireadirect.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our first question came from a new friend
who did not send a name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their question says, Wagwan Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big ups on so many hundreds of podcasts,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the congratulations on all
of the podcasts, 866 episodes and no sign
[SPEAKER_01]: of slowing down or stopping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for noticing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to jump right to the question
part.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of a little setup here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get right to the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, anyway, my question is this.
[SPEAKER_01]: When flipping back to 18 six and the last
two weeks or 10 days, won't the trichomes
[SPEAKER_01]: just be ripe and immature?
[SPEAKER_01]: Many thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big man.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this question is referring to a
technique that I've been talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: that gets a lot of feedback, a lot of
response and a lot of controversy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been using a technique where at the
end of my flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been flowering for seven,
eight and a half, maybe nine weeks for the
[SPEAKER_01]: last 10, maybe 14 days of my flowering
cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I change my timer from 18 hours on to six
hours off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, a lot of people's heads just fucking
exploded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would you do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you putting those lights back on a
vegetative light cycle?
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, that's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a very good reason for doing
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially what I'm doing,
and there are a lot of questions that come
[SPEAKER_01]: with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try to address a couple of those as
we talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so I turn so 10 days before I am going
to harvest, generally 10 days before
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest and do this with the cultivar you
are familiar with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do this on the first time you've ran
a plant because you don't know how long it
[SPEAKER_01]: goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do this with a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how long it goes and then adjust
your schedule accordingly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a plant, you've ran it
multiple times.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes 70 days at day 60.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would change my light cycle from 12
hours on 12 hours off back to 18 hours on
[SPEAKER_01]: and six hours off a vegetative light
cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm increasing my light by 50% per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people, like I said, are freaking
the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would you do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the first reason I want to do that
is I have found that it makes my plants
[SPEAKER_01]: finish a little bit more quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get them to speed up by several
days, sometimes two, three, maybe four or
[SPEAKER_01]: five days, depending on the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I have noticed that it increases in
bud density.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes the buds a little more bulky,
a little bit more dense, and it also makes
[SPEAKER_01]: them weigh a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's making them finish faster and it's
making them more dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have never in my whole teaching about
this whole method, I have never said that
[SPEAKER_01]: we should get more trichomes from this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's never been part of the theory,
part of the practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's never been the idea because I agree
with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this did promote trichomes,
those trichomes would be premature,
[SPEAKER_01]: not immature, but premature trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wouldn't be ripe.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wouldn't be worth smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There would be no advantage to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I feel like that the bro science of
putting your plants in darkness for 24
[SPEAKER_01]: hours to achieve more trichomes that would
do the exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would get more trichomes, but they
would not be ripe.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would not be amber in color.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would not be filled with the proper
oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wouldn't be ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I started telling everybody about
this technique, the intention was never to
[SPEAKER_01]: encourage or increase or promote trichome
development.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was always about bud development,
about bud density and speeding up the
[SPEAKER_01]: finishing time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned this technique and started doing
this with seeded crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I pollinate crops, I put them back on
18-6 very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: After pollination, because that light
source gives my plants more energy and I
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted my seeds to get more robust more
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I thought if it works on my
seeds, why not do it on the flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: crops?
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we can't do it too early because
they will revedge if you do this too
[SPEAKER_01]: early.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I learned to do this the last 10 days
of the flowering cycle, and it does make
[SPEAKER_01]: my buds more dense and they finish more
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from the very beginning, this was never
intended to increase or promote trichome
[SPEAKER_01]: development.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the bottom line of this question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only been for bud density and to
speed up the harvest time of that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now a lot of people ask me a lot of
different questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: They ask, how do you do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: When do you do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I will explain very simply and very
quickly and very much why I do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said before, we've got a plant that
we have grown several times.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know what this plant does.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you harvest this plant consistently at
day 70 and you have a solid outcome that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're happy with, I would say turn that
light at day 60 put the light back on 18.6
[SPEAKER_01]: and allow that plant to get that 50% more
photon energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, in my experience,
in my education, light is the number one
[SPEAKER_01]: source of energy for our plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So giving that plant more light,
more energy will allow it to grow more
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will get more density and it will
finish even sooner because it is
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesizing more, metabolizing more
while those lights are on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is getting the energy to do so while
the lights are on and it will do those
[SPEAKER_01]: processes when the lights go off with more
vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also use green sensation to make these
processes a little bit easier on the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're doing 18.6 adding green
sensation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green sensation comes in at week four,
but it sticks around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reason for changing the light is I
believe that that light gives me more
[SPEAKER_01]: photon energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That photon energy is more production.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going to ask, do you change the
intensity of the lights?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I simply change the timer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing changes but the timer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't adjust the intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't go less.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't go more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go more hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is all that I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I highly recommend that you do this
with a plant that you know how long it
[SPEAKER_01]: takes to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep saying that because you may be
wasting potential or you may be triggering
[SPEAKER_01]: issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find a plant that you know how long it
takes to flower, that you're satisfied
[SPEAKER_01]: with the outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you flush, that's a whole other topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really flush.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not something I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you flush during that flush phase,
go back to 18.6.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will speed up the ripening and it'll
give you more dense buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this was never meant to be about
trichome production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't want that to be a confusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: The number one question I get around this
is when to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 days before flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: The number two question I get is,
do you change the light intensity?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leave it right how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Change the timer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep an eye on the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Third question I get is, won't this make
my plants revej?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do it for 18, 22 days, then they
will revej.
[SPEAKER_01]: But 10 days, they will not revej.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they do, you've got a problematic plant
and that plant was going to give you some
[SPEAKER_01]: shit anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you are looking to work on a revej
project, now you are way ahead of the game
[SPEAKER_01]: because you've been in the revej light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already been receiving that light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It knows I'm in 18.6.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's starting to do stuff hormonally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you do harvest the lowers and
leave a couple lower buds, you are way
[SPEAKER_01]: ahead of the game for your revej project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my dude who did not send a name,
I appreciate the great question.

[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, let's keep this show moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: This next question came from our new
friend Matthew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Matthew, thank you for the great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you check your inbox because

[SPEAKER_01]: That way you never miss any of my amazing
cannabis educational content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, this question from my new friend
Matthew goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, I was listening
to your podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that got me looking at your seeds and
I want to ask a question about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, are your feminized seeds self
pollinated?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is kind of a trick question.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, will their genetics be similar to
the seedling mother or can they still have
[SPEAKER_01]: a fair bit of variance?
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so I want to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are the seeds self pollinated?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if they were self pollinated,
you can only make one strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I do, I take one female plant and
I treat that female plant with a solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about that at another
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked about it a lot in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take this female plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I treat it with the solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: It creates pollen that only contains
female chromosomes because it is a female
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I then take that pollen and I can put that
pollen on a clone of the same plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be considered a self
pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is an S1.
[SPEAKER_01]: That plant definitely is self pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I take that pollen and put that
pollen on other plants to create other
[SPEAKER_01]: outcrosses, those are what is known as a
reversal, an R1 or an R2 if it's a further
[SPEAKER_01]: filial, but we're getting carried away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got a difference between a self
and a reversal is what you're basically
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of my plants are self pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Golden goat is a self pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Golden goat is a golden goat clone
pollinating a golden goat clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you are getting pure unadulterated
golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you get with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lemon Jeffrey, on the other hand,
is the golden goat pollen put on a lemon
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk female.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we make the lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is a reversal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the female pollen put on the lemon
Jeffrey that makes the lemon Jeffrey that
[SPEAKER_01]: makes a feminized seed because of that
feminized pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got two different types of
breeding projects here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two types of feminized breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is a self.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is a reversal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about the second part of this
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will their genetics be similar to the
seeding mother or can they still have a
[SPEAKER_01]: fair bit of variance?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's focus first with the golden goat S1,
the self golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I see with the golden goat,
a lot of the times, I see about 40% of the
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypes look just like the original
mother.
[SPEAKER_01]: 40% of them look just like the original
mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's about 25% that look a little
bit like one of the parents on one side,
[SPEAKER_01]: the father.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's about 25% of the offspring
that look like the mother.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got 25 dad, 25 mom, that's 50%.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got 40% that looks just like the golden
goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's 10% of them that are just
fucking random weirdos.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a phenotype in there that grows
real tall, real skinny, real wispy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a real long time to finish,
but it is the most potent out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't look anything like the original
golden goat, but it is amazingly potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it tastes like a tart, sour,
funky grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes my head spin when I smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that phenotype is in there,
but that is not the common phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a little bit of an outlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, that's probably 10%.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to even narrow it down to say
probably 5% of the phenotypes will express
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other five are just going to be
weirdos that I'm not even sure what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: So approximately 40% of the offspring are
going to look just like the mother,
[SPEAKER_01]: just like the golden goat clone that I've
got that we started with.
[SPEAKER_01]: 25% are going to look kind of like mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: 25% are going to look kind of like dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: 5% fucking weirdos and 5% make that real
tall, lanky, wild fucking phenotype that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what you're going to see from
the S1 from the golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's talk more about the R1.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to focus again on the lemon
Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lemon Jeffrey, there's one common
phenotype that you can see a perfect 50-50
[SPEAKER_01]: mix of the lemon skunk and the golden
goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is kind of the common phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once again, I'm going to say that's
about 40%.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is about 40%.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 50-50 mix, you're going to see about
40% of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then once again, 25% of the time,
we're going to see stuff that looks a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: like golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then 25% of the time, we're going to see
stuff that looks a lot like the lemon
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then 10% of the time, we're just going to
get weird outliers that kind of are,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could look like grandparents.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could look like great grandparents.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just going to be weirdos.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is kind of how breeding works when
we're doing these crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've got the opportunity with these
crosses now to see something that I do see
[SPEAKER_01]: commonly.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the reversed golden goat crosses,
especially with, and we're going to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about specific parents here, the lemon
Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I make the lemon Jeffrey,
the lemon skunk dominates that cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most, a lot of the phenotypes,
I say 25 are going to look like mom,
[SPEAKER_01]: 25 are going to look like dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of just genetics, the way this one
skews, the way it sways, probably 35% of
[SPEAKER_01]: them look more like the lemon skunk,
and the remaining 10 look like the golden
[SPEAKER_01]: goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just how it works with this cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's shift gears and talk about
orangegasm, which is the same golden goat
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinating a platinum tangy female.
[SPEAKER_01]: More of those phenotypes are going to look
like the golden goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The golden goat shines through on that
one, and the platinum tangy doesn't come
[SPEAKER_01]: through the mixes dominantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to kind of vary plant to
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the S1s, the self ones,
most of the time I'm seeing 40% mom,
[SPEAKER_01]: 25, 25, and 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's mostly what we get.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just also depends when we start doing
the reversals, you see similar,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you start opening up the options.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's another ingredient in the
breeding mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something is going to be dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something is going to be recessive.
[SPEAKER_01]: In those plants, you could have some
traits from this plant that are dominant,
[SPEAKER_01]: and some traits from this plant that are
dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might get weird shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might find totally recessive traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have no idea where it came from when
you start doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of the time, and that's my new
math that I'm going to stick to,
[SPEAKER_01]: 40, 25, 25, and those two can sway a
little bit side to side.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be 35 and 10 based on how the
genes fucking mesh together.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're going to get 40% that are 50,
50, or 40% like the original mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got 50% to play with that are going to
shift back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10, 35, 25, 25.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sound like a fucking auctioneer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we got that 10% available for the
outliers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The outliers are always going to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how genetics works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the outliers are the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I answered that part of the
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is more to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, I'm trying to understand genetic
variance between your feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And say a clone you may drop in the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that's all right to ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never apologize for asking questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only stupid question is the one that
you do not ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it says, I'm picking up some
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pick up some seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're asking about what is the
difference between a seed and a clone that
[SPEAKER_01]: you may pick up those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I run the same seeds that I sell you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Occasionally, if I want to run some new
seeds, I'll go to my inventory,
[SPEAKER_01]: my stash, my vault.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say, Hey, I want to run some lemon
Jeffrey seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll pull out a pack just like I would
have sold to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll pull out two packs just like you
would have bought.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll germinate them and I will grow them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I find the keeper out of those two
packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lemon Jeffrey that I'm selling on the
website now is sold out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the lemon Jeffrey that I'm selling on
the website is simply, it came from a pack
[SPEAKER_01]: of seeds that I ran and I found it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought that is a bad ass keeper and
I kept it and I've been running it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is where it came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cream plant that I will be using in
the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy, Brian, shout out to Brian.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Brian's cream cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend Brian has a grow local near me
and I went over there one day and saw the
[SPEAKER_01]: cream and I went, that fucking plant right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, I know a bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he gave me a clone of it and I'm using
that cream cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are just cuts that we found in packs
of seeds and I make them available because
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're stellar.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're standout.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a very good representation of the
product that I was trying to sell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since I found that, I just decided to
offer that to you so that you could get
[SPEAKER_01]: the cut that I found and I could share my
work and my discovery with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, the seeds are self-pollinated or
they are reversals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very little of what I'm doing lately is
just a regular male to female pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've still got my boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my lovely ladies, but the regular
seeds simply do not sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: 90, 85% of the market lately has been
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could put reg seeds on sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will sit there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fem seeds charge regular price.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys will buy them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is my answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sticking to it.

[SPEAKER_01]: Also, while you're watching this podcast,
make sure you check your spam folder
[SPEAKER_01]: because I sent out an email today that you
want to read.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, my buddy, Aaron, thank you for
the great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes a little bit like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, my question is, will a plant get
stronger or better with each generation?
[SPEAKER_01]: The story we always heard about G13 was
that it is the 13th generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for all of the knowledge and
good vibes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not believe or think that G13 was the
13th generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not my belief.
[SPEAKER_01]: For that to be the 13th generation,
that means that they took two plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: bred them together.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the F1.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seeds that came from there were the
first filial generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they would have made seeds of that
and bred them together, and they would
[SPEAKER_01]: have done this all the way up to F13.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not believe, since this was supposed
to be a university-led government-bred
[SPEAKER_01]: project, I have no faith that they went to
F13.
[SPEAKER_01]: F13 means that if you grew a seed from
that plant, every seed would be completely
[SPEAKER_01]: identical.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would be homozygous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone would look exactly the fucking
same.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have never seen anything bred to the G13
come out uniform like that, so I do not
[SPEAKER_01]: think that it was the 13th generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: My thought process is that there were
probably plants that were put in a grid.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were columns and rows.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H,
I, and then one through whatever number it
[SPEAKER_01]: was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that plant that happened to be in
spot G, spot 13, bingo, you sunk my
[SPEAKER_01]: battleship.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is the plant that whoever was
working with this product, that is the one
[SPEAKER_01]: that they kept.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is just the way that I think it
happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no proof, no evidence, no
reliability, no reason to believe that G13
[SPEAKER_01]: is 13 generations through.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not true in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't fucking prove it, but just the
things I know, I don't believe that in any
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now your question about a plant getting
stronger each generation, do you mean
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding generation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because people have a lot of misnomers and
misconceptions about the way cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you mean if I breed this plant to
itself, or to its filial generation 13
[SPEAKER_01]: times, will it get better?
[SPEAKER_01]: It should, if we are selectively breeding
properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: If nature is doing it, maybe, maybe not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will breed for the survival traits that
work best in that environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it may not be the best aroma,
flavor, or smoke that you're able to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are selectively breeding 13
generations, you better be improving every
[SPEAKER_01]: generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the purpose of breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your breeding isn't improving,
then you're taking the plant backwards,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's not what we're here to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each generation should be better,
better, better every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So does it get better each generation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now are you asking every time you grow
that plant, like if I cut a clone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because some people, I've heard this
before, some people do believe that if I
[SPEAKER_01]: grow a plant, cut a clone, and grow it
again, it gets better each time.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's the same fucking plant every
single time.
[SPEAKER_01]: What got better was you as a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got more adapted to the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You learned how to grow that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like taking that plant out on several
dates.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first date, you go out with somebody,
whoever it is, it's awkward.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know what they're into.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know what they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know what they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have no idea who they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're meeting them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like the first time growing a
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the third or fourth time growing a
plant, you know in week six, it needs a
[SPEAKER_01]: little more of this or a little bit less
of this or defoliate or don't defoliate,
[SPEAKER_01]: just like you learn a person.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's not the generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it is you getting better if that's
in fact what's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is, does it get better
with each generation?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not clone wise, but if you're breeding
it, it better.
[SPEAKER_01]: The breeder better be improving upon that
generation every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the 13th generation of G-13,
I don't believe that's true at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that's complete bullshit,
but that's what I'm here for, breaking up
[SPEAKER_01]: rumors and telling the truth.
