Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: welcome back podcast world.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_04]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is episode 630 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the special 420 celebration
episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy 420.
[SPEAKER_04]: This episode comes out on April 19th.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you are ready to celebrate on 420
with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: For my 420 celebration this year,
I invited a bunch of friends to join me on
[SPEAKER_04]: a Zoom meeting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had about 25 friends show up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to everybody that joined us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked a little shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I edited some of it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I left a little bit of it in.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you guys enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to make a really long intro
because the show is really, really long.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with no further ado, here is the 420
celebration episode of the Grow From Your
[SPEAKER_04]: Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really quickly, welcome to the 420 show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks to everybody that showed up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some will come.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some will go.
[SPEAKER_04]: More will show up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to quickly try to do intros.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I feel Dirtman Dan's pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting through intros on like 12 screens
is going to be a fun adventure here.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I see Dirtman Dan looking at me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dirtman Dan, really quickly, can you tell
us where you're located and how we can
[SPEAKER_04]: stalk you on social media?
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm Dirtman Dan.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm over here on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can find me on social media at Dirtman
Dan or Embracing Organics.
[SPEAKER_04]: On Instagram, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for joining me, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fun being on Embracing Organics.
[SPEAKER_04]: You inspired this madness here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is all your fault.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's follow that up by introducing the
first dreadlock that showed up to the
[SPEAKER_04]: party.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's welcome my buddy Steve, also known
as Potent Ponics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are you joining us from,
Steve?
[SPEAKER_04]: And how can people stalk you on social
media?
[SPEAKER_21]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm joining you guys from Oklahoma this
week.
[SPEAKER_21]: I travel around quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_21]: And you can find me at either apmjclass

the different separate platforms that are

[SPEAKER_04]: That's a mouthful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the show, brother.

joining us from and how they can stalk you
[SPEAKER_04]: tonight?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm joining from Michigan.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, we didn't intend to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Getting big enough that people would have
to say the name.
[SPEAKER_05]: Major oversight on our part.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, you can find us at Michigan Bros
Grow Show on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my own Instagram doesn't really matter
that much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for having me, Jeff.

[SPEAKER_02]: I'm from Illinois.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm one of the weirdos here in the
Midwest, kind of the third coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if anybody, if I can be helpful to
anybody with food, I'm in the food
[SPEAKER_02]: industry by trade.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my kind of thing is food science.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody's got any questions,
hit me up on IG, Genetic Memory Farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for joining us, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna keep moving to my right.

how do we stalk you, bro?
[SPEAKER_26]: Hey, how's it going, everyone?
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you so much for inviting me,
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_26]: I am from Southern California.
[SPEAKER_26]: I've been growing for almost four years,
just about now.
[SPEAKER_26]: And yeah, just kind of delved into it.
[SPEAKER_26]: And once I started learning, got into
more, I wanted to major in it.
[SPEAKER_26]: So that's where I am now, getting all into
that right in the middle of all my
[SPEAKER_26]: schooling too.
[SPEAKER_26]: Just like Jeff mentioned, I'm on,
you can see me here and there on a couple
[SPEAKER_26]: podcasts, but yeah, mainly I'm helping out

doing a collaborative effort with the
[SPEAKER_26]: neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm really excited for that.
[SPEAKER_26]: We're gonna have a 420 special.

bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: And how can we stalk you?
[SPEAKER_04]: How can we stalk you on social media?
[SPEAKER_17]: Cheers, everyone.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm Duckweed.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm coming all the way from fucking
Caribbean, a little island called Trinidad
[SPEAKER_17]: and Tobago.
[SPEAKER_17]: We just kind of decriminalized the whole
process of doing shit just about a little
[SPEAKER_17]: over a year now.
[SPEAKER_17]: So yeah, looking forward to this cool
hangout with all you crazy stoners.
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, thanks, Jeff, for putting this
together and inviting us all.
[SPEAKER_17]: You can find me at nutsandguts866.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for joining us all the way from
over there, staying up late to hang out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on to one of my favorite
partners in crime, a guy that's been on my
[SPEAKER_04]: podcast quite a few times, a familiar face
to everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, thanks for joining us, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to tell everybody where you're
joining from and maybe you might want to
[SPEAKER_04]: let them know how to stalk you on the
social media.
[SPEAKER_19]: Joining from Big Bad Pueblo, Colorado,
just like always.
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you want to stalk me on social
media, check me out at Twitter.
[SPEAKER_19]: You can find me at Nemopunk15 or on
Facebook at Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis
[SPEAKER_19]: Laws.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for being quick, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now let's move over to somebody who I've
been doing a lot of fun stuff with.
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy that runs Cannibuzz, the guy
responsible for a big part of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: community.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we all know where to find him,
but we'll give him a chance to introduce
[SPEAKER_04]: himself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Q, you want to tell us where you're coming
in from?
[SPEAKER_04]: And give us a little bit of info about
Cannibuzz.
[SPEAKER_30]: Hey, everyone.
[SPEAKER_30]: Thanks so much, Jeff, for inviting me.
[SPEAKER_30]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_30]: And shout out to Mike as a listener of the
show.
[SPEAKER_30]: It's the same Zoom as the Wonder Twins or
whatever you want to call them.
[SPEAKER_30]: But yeah, anyways, I'm Q Gros.
[SPEAKER_30]: You can find me on Instagram as well as
Cannibuzz.
[SPEAKER_30]: I co-founded Cannibuzz with JR Token,
who you may know from the Do Gros crew and
[SPEAKER_30]: many other things.
[SPEAKER_30]: And yeah, Cannibuzz is a cannabis social
network and cannabis community of over
[SPEAKER_30]: 115,000 people.
[SPEAKER_30]: Many of them are on this Zoom and
elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_30]: So I just want to shout out to you all and
appreciate you all.
[SPEAKER_30]: I hope you all have a great 420.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to keep going on these intros
because I'm never going to get caught up.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are 20 people in here now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm a quarter of the way through
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks for joining me, Q.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to be so quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stabby, now is your time to shine,
brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you like to tell people where you're
coming in from and how you can be stocked
[SPEAKER_04]: on the social media?
[SPEAKER_11]: Usually I'm trying not to be found.
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you do want to hear me rant and
rave about like red worms or just organic
[SPEAKER_11]: growing in general, there's a couple of
years worth of that on the Embracing
[SPEAKER_11]: Organics channel.
[SPEAKER_11]: And recently I've been... You muted
yourself.
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was me, fat finger.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_11]: But recently I've been honored to be a
guest on the Michigan Gros Bro Show.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just works out a little bit better for my
schedule.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I got a family life,
got a full-time job and all that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And sometimes I'll pop up on Cannibuzz
with updates.
[SPEAKER_11]: Usually I keep it pretty low key though.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good to know that you're over there
on the Michigan Bro's Gros Show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plenty of podcasts for everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to go check it out more often.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, honestly, if you're looking for me,
if you're trying to find me, I'm on the
[SPEAKER_11]: Iri Army Discord.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody in the Discord.
[SPEAKER_04]: Half the people here I think are on that
Discord.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for mentioning that.
[SPEAKER_11]: We built a great community over there and
huge shout out to Greybeard.
[SPEAKER_11]: He deserves all the credit in the world.
[SPEAKER_11]: He puts in so much work over there.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's such a good dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: Super chill.
[SPEAKER_11]: And like daily there are just people in
there hanging, chilling, talking,
[SPEAKER_11]: grow, talking.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we get crazy in there sometimes.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just out there conversations, man,
with like-minded individuals.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a good community.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I have to close the app at night
because I just already go bleep,
[SPEAKER_04]: bleep, bleep, because you guys are just
always chatting.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to modify your notifications.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Savvy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to move on.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk more about Discord in a minute,
but I got about 10 more people to get
[SPEAKER_04]: through and then we're going to turn this
party into a smoke sesh.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move up more toward Canada and
introduce my buddy, a fellow grower,
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Schwooby Dooby Doo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for joining us, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to tell people how to stalk you
and let us know where you're coming from.
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm coming from Ontario, Canada.
[SPEAKER_23]: You can stalk me on Instagram at Schwooby
Doo and on YouTube, the Grow4Show and
[SPEAKER_23]: Operation Grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're doing a great job.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love seeing your progress.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep the picks coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we get to grow it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that quick introduction there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's next on my list?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a good friend, a good supporter
of the Ivory Army, a member of the
[SPEAKER_04]: Discord, a big contributor to the
Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_04]: My buddy, Dave's not here.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's here and he's even showing his face.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to tell people how to stalk
you and also let them know where you're
[SPEAKER_04]: coming in from?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm coming in from New York, fresh and
legal now.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: Congrats, bro.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can find me on Instagram, Dave
Underscore is not here, spelled with a Z
[SPEAKER_13]: like you see on the screen.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_13]: You'll see me on the Neighborhood Grow
Show and there you go.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for keeping it quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then let's move over to another member of
the neighborhood, another huge
[SPEAKER_04]: contributing factor of the Ivory Army,
a guy that I call The Wrench.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you join us on YouTube and you see
somebody moderating people, if you got
[SPEAKER_04]: kicked out of the YouTube chat,
it was this guy that did it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's welcome my buddy, Perk, to the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome, Perk.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to let us know where you're
coming from?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where you're coming from and how we can
stalk you on the social media.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: First, thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm also coming from New York,
newly legal.
[SPEAKER_08]: Congrats, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can find me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's purplethelmoji and I am part of the
Neighborhood Grows community and Ivory
[SPEAKER_08]: Army and you'll be seeing more of me with
my other friends.
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep it going.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for being brief.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to all talk here in just a
minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got, I think, six more to go through.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move it right on through and go to
more of my Canadian friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's pick up my buddy, Shipwreck,
for a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shipy, you want to tell us how we can find
you on social media and let us know what
[SPEAKER_04]: part of Canada you're coming in from?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: What's up, everyone?
[SPEAKER_12]: Good to see all the spam in one place.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not too far away from Shoeb,
Southern Ontario, and you can find me on
[SPEAKER_12]: Instagram, Shipwreck underscore 420 or on
the Neighborhood Grows.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for joining us, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always a pleasure to hear your sweet
Canadian voice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Aw, shucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I expected from a Canadian.
[SPEAKER_04]: Aw, shucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to switch it up now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're moving over to, I think,
Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go talk to somebody who's
been on the show before, a repeat
[SPEAKER_04]: offender, a good friend of mine,
a fellow grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just going to introduce him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse, welcome to the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to tell people how to find you
and where you're located.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we can, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sound good.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Good to see you, brother.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_14]: Long time listener, first time caller.
[SPEAKER_14]: Looking good in the hiring shoot,
too.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: You like that?
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm here with my homie, Carlos,
Maxi Weed.
[SPEAKER_14]: What up, Maxi Weed?
[SPEAKER_14]: Good to see you, brother.
[SPEAKER_14]: Happy 420, everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy 420.
[SPEAKER_07]: Way to go, Cabros.
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy 420, bros.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you meet your brother?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheers, cheers.
[SPEAKER_07]: From Mexico, Maxi Weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy 420.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got somebody from everywhere here.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheers, brother.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to sit back and let you guys
talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we find you on social media,
bro?
[SPEAKER_14]: Jesse Gros on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's pretty much how you find me.
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, maybe Wet Mountain Creations,
but maybe you can find Carlos here,
[SPEAKER_14]: Maxi Weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, basically on Instagram, YouTube,
Facebook, you can find me at Maxi Weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You will find this logo.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give them both a follow, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great growers, good guys to follow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for joining us.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to keep moving.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I got four more people to get
through, unless more pop in.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're making some segue, some headway
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a new friend here on the screen,
somebody I've never met face to face,
[SPEAKER_04]: but a longtime supporter of the Irish
Army, rocking the Irish gear, putting a
[SPEAKER_04]: smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks like somebody that honestly would
have just been in my crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not one to judge a book by its cover,
but me and this guy definitely would have
[SPEAKER_04]: rode around in the band together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Caused some fucking trouble.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to welcome my buddy, Red Eye Jedi
Gros to the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brother, you want to let us know where
you're coming in?
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us how we can stalk you on that
social media.
[SPEAKER_25]: Great to be here.
[SPEAKER_25]: Happy 420.
[SPEAKER_25]: You can find me on Instagram at Red Eye
Jedi Gros.
[SPEAKER_25]: I pop into the neighborhood every once in
a while to hang out with everybody.
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm just happy to be here, happy to hang
out with all you people.
[SPEAKER_25]: Happy 420, everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy 420, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell yeah, let's get baked.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, don't be afraid to smoke on
screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody should have clouds in their room
by now.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the 420 show.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will come out on 419, but this is the
420 show.
[SPEAKER_04]: So definitely put those clouds in the air.
[SPEAKER_04]: Quick note that when I was in high school,
I wanted my band to be called Red Eye
[SPEAKER_04]: Jedi.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was really a dream of mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody else agreed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I should have done it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, let's keep it moving.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a good friend here that I've met
in the neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's been a longtime supporter.
[SPEAKER_04]: He goes by a lot of names today.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to call him Ganja Groa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ganja, you want to let us know how we can
stalk you on the socials and where you're
[SPEAKER_04]: coming in from today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy 420, Ross and Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a grower in Boston.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find me around the neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of all the content on YouTube and
wherever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Discord, it's great stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for joining us, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: You go by a different name on all of the
chats.
[SPEAKER_04]: And YouTube, you're a different name.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the other stuff, you're a
different name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to let them know that or do
you want to keep that secret so then they
[SPEAKER_04]: know who they're actually talking to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of keep it a little distant just
because.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I asked.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to know if you want them to
know who's trolling the shit out of him or
[SPEAKER_04]: not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually keep it simple though,
don't I?
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're only here because I love you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I'm wondering if I know who you are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: You do.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's dig out of this hole real
quick and move right on over to the
[SPEAKER_04]: captain and commander of the iry army.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the honestly the longest supporters
of iry genetics, the grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_04]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only a supporter, this dude's become
my friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: We email back and forth.
[SPEAKER_04]: We talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's an educator.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's my friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've said his name before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: My buddy lemur priest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for joining us, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cool to see everyone here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy 420.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy 420, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's cool to see everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's been a while since I found the
podcast and iry genetics and yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been loving it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smoking on summer rise actually for 420.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You grow my genetics so well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dinky and gross.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's gross in all the right ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you show off the tattoo if I asked
you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that too much for the show?
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Perp's got a tattoo, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: We overlooked that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize, Perp.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, check out that tattoo, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the first iry genetics tattoo I
ever saw.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perp, if you want to flash yours,
too, go for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm not sure exactly where yours is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on his Instagram is where it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give him a follow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for getting half naked for us,
Lemur.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: We won't make you undo any buckles.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I did it myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, that's I can't I couldn't do
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am asking dudes to undress on my show.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to get the view somehow,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Listen, man, it looks like a fly right
now.
[SPEAKER_10]: But when I get all riled up, I swear it's
the iry army logo.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's iryjeff at onlyfans.com.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's iryjeff at onlyfans.com.
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't tell anybody about that.
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's it's rusted dredge on OnlyFans.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, let's keep moving.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got one more intro to do and then we
can turn turn loose this circus here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I made a new friend on the hood.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's been following me for a little while.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm now following him to really cool dude,
fellow seed nerd, maybe different kinds of
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: But seed nerds are seed nerds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know the feeling.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know the struggle.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to welcome to the show my friend,
the foraging gardener.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome foraging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy for 20 everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I am a seed nerd.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm also a cannabis connoisseur,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're packing up seeds when at the
same time as me just trying to get ordered
[SPEAKER_04]: out.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what they do in the neighborhood
almost every night.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what I'm doing in the background
if I'm not on camera usually.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need vegetable seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna have to hit you up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you should.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Business is happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are you chiming in from?
[SPEAKER_04]: And how can my friends follow you here on
social media?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still in probation land.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Midwest is a criminalized land.
[SPEAKER_04]: But whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, let's not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Film the police.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_17]: Where we got no vegetable seeds,
though.
[SPEAKER_17]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, we got no vegetable seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, bellaseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, fuck.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good move.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good move, Doug.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for joining us, by the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for being patient with getting
through 420 intros.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's amazingly impressive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody talked over anybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all got through that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy 420.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know where to begin.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we can do this and we'll start the
conversation here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anybody know what 420 actually came
from?
[SPEAKER_04]: Does everybody in this room have any idea
why we celebrate 420, what this is all
[SPEAKER_04]: about?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or are we just smoking because we're
smoking?
[SPEAKER_05]: From the story of college students thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think I know a little bit about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was some college students in California
that would smoke at 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it was at 420 after a certain
class, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're getting out of school.
[SPEAKER_04]: They all got out of school about four and
they'd all meet at a place, at a certain
[SPEAKER_04]: statue, I believe it was, at 420.
[SPEAKER_14]: I heard it was like some college kids in
NorCal, fucking, like Grateful Dead kids.
[SPEAKER_04]: But pretty sure some of them were
deadheads.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty sure a couple of them were
deadheads.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a group.
[SPEAKER_04]: They called themselves the Waldo's,
is actually what the group was called.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so most of the story is basically,
yeah, they would just meet every day at
[SPEAKER_04]: this one spot and smoke at 420.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where 420 came from.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we owe this holiday, this meeting,
this podcast is all because of a bunch of
[SPEAKER_04]: dorks that wanted to gather after school
and smoke some weed together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they made a time 420 and it's stuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Imagine starting a legend that big or like
a piece of folklore, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's a crazy thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like inventing a word.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that will live on forever too.
[SPEAKER_03]: To where every stoner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine the first time they heard that
from someone else like, Oh, Hey man,
[SPEAKER_03]: like 420, you know, and then like,
dude, I swear I made that up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they saying our thing, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they doing our thing?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they saw stickers of it and
shirts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now there's 420 pipe cleaner and 420
stores and the mile marker 420 sign gets
[SPEAKER_04]: stolen everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have a mile marker 420 in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have 419.99 because they'll steal the
420 every time.
[SPEAKER_16]: Unfortunately, we don't have that among
the miles.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we don't even get the 420 miles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Allegedly I would trade you something for
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, you tried to say something and your
mic did not sound loud enough,
[SPEAKER_04]: buddy.
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't even remember what it was at this
point.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was probably something about the Waldo.
[SPEAKER_11]: He was probably going to give us some deep
backstory on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Red, I thank you for joining us for the
brief moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was great to meet you on camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I look forward to hanging out in the
future, brother.
[SPEAKER_25]: A bunch of stuff I got to handle,
so happy 420, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy 420, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: See you next time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy 420, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Waldos were high school kids?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, San Rafael High School, I believe,
was the rumored location.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew San Rafael was the place,
but I didn't know if it was a college or
[SPEAKER_04]: high school.
[SPEAKER_04]: Raptor, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: We totally interrupted you.
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, no worries.
[SPEAKER_26]: I actually wanted to hear that,
too.
[SPEAKER_26]: But yeah, I got some strawberry Starburst.
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's see, when was this?
[SPEAKER_26]: January 21st, 2020.
[SPEAKER_26]: So what a way to bring in that year.
[SPEAKER_26]: And actually, super delicious.
[SPEAKER_26]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_26]: Just like a strawberry candy.
[SPEAKER_26]: I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_26]: And I actually don't personally combust.
[SPEAKER_26]: I use a vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_26]: I often use underdog vapes.
[SPEAKER_26]: This just lines up with this in my bong.
[SPEAKER_26]: So I'm able to enjoy all the flavor,
all the flavor.
[SPEAKER_26]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_26]: I've really been enjoying it through the
whole year.
[SPEAKER_26]: And I've just had a nice little stash
right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you self-sufficient at this point?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you keep yourself supplied?
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_26]: I just said that was from January of last
year.
[SPEAKER_26]: That's pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not have product from January.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have product from January of this
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I had product from January of last
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would solve some things.
[SPEAKER_10]: The only reason I have product from
January is because I made a point to save
[SPEAKER_10]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think it's better after a really
long cure and storage like that?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I just didn't want to smoke at all.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's got to be conservative.
[SPEAKER_11]: He doesn't have a very large grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: That little cubicle doesn't put out too
many pounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got to report that it's San Rafael
High School in Marin County, which is
[SPEAKER_04]: north of San Francisco on the other side
of the Golden Gate Bridge.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lot of details, but that's where
420 came from.
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember High Times doing a whole story
about it and reading that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember where you first heard
about 420?
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it in High Times or was it somebody in
high school?
[SPEAKER_13]: High school, no doubt.
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy that introduced the actual number
420 to me has actually passed away now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So shout out to my buddy James Ritchie.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's no longer with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was an amazing artist, really
obnoxious, outspoken dude, an amazing bass
[SPEAKER_04]: player, but he was the first one that I
ever heard say 420.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, what the fuck,
420?
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the context it was said,
I knew what it meant, but I didn't know
[SPEAKER_04]: 420 yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Mexico it's the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: 420 means like the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like in high school, basically,
they're talking about the 420 thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like, oh, it's that smoker thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like Stoner thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cultural.
[SPEAKER_04]: Crosses borders.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: 420 worldwide.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to puff to that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh shit, Jeff is doing the power.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been smoking the bowl, nobody even
noticed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, shout out to our friend Stoney
Scholar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stoney gave me this pipe, so big shout out
to Stoney.
[SPEAKER_15]: Damn, I got to bust out my pipe now.
[SPEAKER_15]: You even own Flower Jeff?
[SPEAKER_15]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm heartbroken, Jeff, because I
have a bowl that matches that and I broke
[SPEAKER_11]: it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Shortly before he passed away,
I was going to get in contact with him
[SPEAKER_11]: because he had the guy make a matching set
and I was going to have it repaired.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't even know how to contact that
dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if that person's watching,
contact myself or Stabby so we can get
[SPEAKER_04]: that pipe repaired because they could be
watching.
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's fucking sweet.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, somebody else can fix it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I mean, I'm not going to throw it
away ever.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll find someone eventually, but I was
just hoping to have the original artist do
[SPEAKER_11]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to have to get sequence some
new ones over there for 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: My whole body is sweating.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the second time I've done that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was watching that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was huge.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to 500 degrees because I figured it
was really big to cool it off.
[SPEAKER_05]: It did not work.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Impressive rip, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next time I'll try to put you up on the
big screen if I remember before I see it
coming.
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of dab presses, I recently got a
low temp setup and man, I love it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm in love.
[SPEAKER_04]: I may have to try some more rosin because
all my friends are making rosin,
[SPEAKER_04]: squishing all day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just not a fan of most of what I
smoke when it comes to rosin, but just
[SPEAKER_04]: have to figure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I figure out how to do that correctly.
[SPEAKER_04]: That looks good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I have a sequence.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have not.
[SPEAKER_04]: As soon as Dan tells us what he's smoking,
we're going to talk about that because
[SPEAKER_04]: that thing's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pink lemonade Ambrosia from Apothecary
Farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: I recognize those ladies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not even going to ask how,
why, when and where, because I know where
[SPEAKER_04]: you are, my friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's magical.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm proud of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's focus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, look, cuz that's some crack over
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some good, clear looking concentrates,
bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is some Durban poison live resin.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Very delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Still magically delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, sequence.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about that little, uh,
little thermometer thing you've got over
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen a lot of people with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to put you up here on the main
screen.
[SPEAKER_05]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we got cuz up.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: The turpa meter.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like a hundred bucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it tells the temperature using a
thermocoupler.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm holding it for the camera.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's really, really probably the best
way to tell the temperature for a banger.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't use it for like a slurper,
but phenomenal.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically heat up your banger,
stick it right on in there and wait till
[SPEAKER_04]: it gets the temperature that you're
comfortable with and then rip it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll rise up until it like settles.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then once it starts dropping in temp,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like at a steady temp.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I try to dab anywhere between four and
500 usually.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: This thing seems to read 70 degrees off of
an IR thermometer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it stays the same temperature the full
dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: My email is really nice and you can use
this to calibrate your email as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's pretty smooth.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did that at my buddy's house.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we could put it on the email and
adjusted the email accordingly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like an email, but for some reason I,
it just doesn't, it's not hot enough to,
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to heat up my banger any way to
clean it or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just doesn't, it's not efficient for
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love having it around.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be good right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: The fact it's sitting around to hit the
email.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I didn't have to have the torch going,
but for the most part, I prefer just
[SPEAKER_04]: torching it up and doing it that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's a beautiful setup you got cuz.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's another cord on the table for a
podcaster.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a whole nother thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_11]: I see arguments.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've owned an email as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: Many rigs perished to the, uh,
the old email cord.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen it pull a joint right off
before.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen glass killers for sure,
but to each their own.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why they make a lot of different
toys.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why potheads buy them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause we love toys and it's a lot of clean
fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, since nobody asked, I'm dabbing on
Picasso, uh, live batter from Green Dot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got me talking to him.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got me a little ahead of him.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got me heavy eyed and droopy eyed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm digging this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can tell I just took one fat dab out
of this container.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's working pretty good for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's working pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the 420 episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been talking about what you guys are
smoking on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, this is the pre 420 episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're in a weird, uh, I don't even want to
say the word, a weird pandemic situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Still, it's kind of ending.
[SPEAKER_04]: People are getting medicines and shit,
but what are we doing for 420?
[SPEAKER_04]: Has anybody got any fun plans or anything?
[SPEAKER_04]: We going out, we'd stand in having a
party.
[SPEAKER_23]: Lockdown.
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought I would have gone to the beach,
but like we just got 17 new cases
[SPEAKER_17]: yesterday and then 85 today.
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're back into like that kind of
semi-lockdown, uh, no beaches,
[SPEAKER_17]: no nothing, no gathering more than five,
that kind of bullshit.
[SPEAKER_17]: So fuck, I guess we'll be around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be online somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: That seems to be the way, the future,
the neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a, there's a public neighborhood
hangout on discord.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you guys, if you're asking about the
neighborhood, ask anybody here in one of
[SPEAKER_04]: these chats through a message and we'll
tell you how to get there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's some stuff going on here in
Oklahoma for 420.
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, there's like a, uh, like the Jack
Herrick for something like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, and there's like some local events,
like, like us personally, we, we have a,
[SPEAKER_14]: like a kind of family barbecue plan that
to grow with all the employees and like
[SPEAKER_14]: they're significant others.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's what we'll be doing on the
actual 420.
[SPEAKER_21]: So if anybody else is in Oklahoma and
Southern Oklahoma, I'll be on Sunday with
[SPEAKER_21]: Afro man.
[SPEAKER_21]: And, um, I forget what the other guy is
playing with kid Lenin.
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's the other guy.
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, uh, you've got a big cannabis fest
going on, on Sunday down in Durant at
[SPEAKER_21]: Bubba's brew house.
[SPEAKER_21]: And we'll be there with a whole bunch of
stuff and hit me up.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, Hey, Steve.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, I think I take it to the, uh,
oh no, I think it's like 421 it's,
[SPEAKER_14]: um, uh, Rome and, uh, Duddy B from the
dirty heads.
[SPEAKER_14]: Down there at the Bubba's brew house in
direct.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll see you there.
[SPEAKER_21]: Then I have to go to Durant soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll meet up in Durant one time because I
have to go there soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a thing going on there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, Jeff tickets for that show.
[SPEAKER_21]: So I've got extras in, you know,
for everyone that doesn't know about the
[SPEAKER_21]: book, the ran Oklahoma, which is in the
middle of nowhere, actually kind of the
[SPEAKER_21]: Texas, Oklahoma border has the largest,
currently the largest cannabis friendly
[SPEAKER_21]: venue in all of the United States.
[SPEAKER_21]: As far as I'm aware, they can have a 2,000
people in that venue in the entire place.
[SPEAKER_21]: And we're the owners.
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's a cool venue.
[SPEAKER_21]: And if you're looking nice place to host a
cannabis event, it's a, the largest place
[SPEAKER_21]: you can legally do that type of event in
the United States right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess I know where we're building the
commune.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, there's also a big casino there.
[SPEAKER_14]: So like if you guys want to lose like a
bunch of money, you know, to an airport,
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, it's in the middle of nowhere,
dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, it's like, um, like Oklahoma
city, I think it's two hours north and I
[SPEAKER_14]: think Dallas is like an hour south.
[SPEAKER_14]: So like pick your airport.
[SPEAKER_14]: I would suggest Dallas person.
[SPEAKER_30]: You got to fly somewhere and get a rental
car, but it's super.
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: The airport sucks a dig.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not a real airport guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate to interrupt the show, but,
uh, we got another, uh, member joining us
[SPEAKER_04]: jumping in from, uh, I'll let him tell us
where he's coming in from a good friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bob on the job has jumped in.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like his internet's a little bit
choppy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if he cuts out, I do apologize.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's coming from an Island, but Rasta Bob,
welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, we have been asking people to tell us
where they're coming in from and their
[SPEAKER_04]: social media handle.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to share that with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the mic is all yours.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to talk for a moment,
Bob, Oh, he's hitting a chalice and he's
[SPEAKER_04]: muted.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, Bob.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll give him a minute.
[SPEAKER_15]: You got to get up on a rest a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's your making moment.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He might be, we'll let him talk whenever
he pops in Island.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a little unstable sometimes.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know he's here.
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll give us a Rasta salute.
[SPEAKER_04]: Greetings.
[SPEAKER_11]: Need some star link down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a big respect, Bob.
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for being there.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is Rasta far.
[SPEAKER_04]: I looks like somebody's telling Tyler
Schwooby goodbye.
[SPEAKER_04]: I might have to get out of here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to hear brother.
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_23]: Water.
[SPEAKER_23]: Go get water.
[SPEAKER_23]: Have a good night, brother.
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you for joining us.
[SPEAKER_23]: Shout out to all the Canadian.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to heat up this dad now.
[SPEAKER_04]: My torch is overwhelming through these
earbuds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to have to start some kind of
conversation.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you guys can talk while I smoke a dad
because I got a, an idea that I had
[SPEAKER_11]: actually just like yesterday.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all yours, buddy.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm muting my mic.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, uh, I was thinking about starting a
little, you know, everyone's doing
[SPEAKER_11]: podcasts, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: But I thought, what if, uh, we use the
discord for a source for content and we've
[SPEAKER_11]: got a channel on there already called the
hot box.
[SPEAKER_11]: We could just do like the hot box live and
it would just be a disc.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it, it's a, I think it's a limit
of four people in that chat room.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you just do like a pow wow chat,
go live and, uh, just broadcast it to the
[SPEAKER_11]: internet.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we talk about all sorts of stuff
on the discord from, I was ranting up and
[SPEAKER_11]: raving about, uh, molten salt thorium
reactors the other day, but, uh,
[SPEAKER_11]: we talk about growing and, uh,
we help people identify.
[SPEAKER_11]: Help bypass problems and all sorts of cool
stuff on there.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a real cool community.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, if I'm going to do more live stuff,
I'm going to do something that goes up on
[SPEAKER_04]: YouTube and Patreon is my next idea
because I owe my patrons something and I
[SPEAKER_04]: can't figure out what to give them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to give them.
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you heard of locals at all?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it sounds like a dating app or
something.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it does it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't like the name of it, but it's like
a new type of patron and there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_11]: people who are adopting it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like it's just a new, new type of platform
like that where you can post content,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, people.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of new stuff coming up like
that with like the brave browser and,
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, earning crypto from like people just
viewing your, your post and stuff like
[SPEAKER_11]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to clone myself if I want to do
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I feel like I need to do
something just for Patreon because,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, the Patreons contribute and they don't
really get anything extra.
[SPEAKER_04]: They get a shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: They get a high five.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to be, uh, committed to
giving them merchandise every month
[SPEAKER_04]: because that's more merch I have to come
up with and print, ship and deliver.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I feel like if I just did like a live
show or something for the patrons,
[SPEAKER_04]: that'd be really cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's usually the way to go with that kind
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you guys get 20 from that dad too,
or was it just me?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally recovered from mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm glad you guys are here to carry
the show for a moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely engaged.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was way easier with 20 people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't it so much fun, Mike?
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually it's you and I trying to figure
out how to fill 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: When you're like, I'm going to hit this
fill every time my brain goes blank.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can count on stabby to talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows what he's going to say,
but you can always count on him.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: You never know what's going to come out of
my mouth.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a gorilla full of snakes.
All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to try to find an image of that
to put on the screen with snake.
[SPEAKER_08]: Smoking bongs of some Leonardo actually by
Jeff himself.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's delicious blueberries.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's blueberry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some funky notes in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: So good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are all the right words.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the plant behind you in your
picture, bro?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's a plant called rascals.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a, um, some sort of Matt cross.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: But pretty plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a pretty color.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty nice actually.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got that perp tour.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I pulled out some of the, uh, I said I was
keeping some of mine around from January.
[SPEAKER_10]: I pulled out some of the Raphael that I
grew, uh, back over the winter and,
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, pull some out of the jar.
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: That might have been focused a lot,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I kept, uh, a small jar of this around
cause like, I love the flavor so much.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know, like stabby said earlier,
I don't have a huge grow.
[SPEAKER_10]: So like when I pull something down,
I like to try and keep at least one small
[SPEAKER_10]: jar of it just kind of stashed away for
like special occasions.
[SPEAKER_10]: And today I feel like, you know,
it's a pretty special occasion,
[SPEAKER_10]: but the Raphael.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I've gotten so many compliments off of
people that have smoked it.
[SPEAKER_10]: They said, you know, it's everything from
like, strawberry candy to like blueberry
[SPEAKER_10]: shisha and, you know, just the,
the flavor profile on it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very complex.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, nobody can really a hundred percent
nail down what it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: She's, she's absolutely frosty and it's,
I've had her probably for like close to
[SPEAKER_10]: three years now that I've kept her around.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was not even going to lie.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like a one pop wonder.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I still have most of the seeds left
from the, the fem pack.
[SPEAKER_10]: That I bought, you know, it was just a one
seed wonder.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there could be something even better in
there that I don't even know about yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've already got a champion.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that you say there's a flavor,
a thing in there that you can't describe
[SPEAKER_04]: because I always say it's got something
like a funk or a wang or just a nose
[SPEAKER_10]: curling goodness.
[SPEAKER_10]: There is this something that everybody,
they just can't nail it down what it is,
[SPEAKER_10]: but they're like, one person says it's
great.
[SPEAKER_10]: One person says it's cough syrup.
[SPEAKER_10]: One person says it's strawberry candy.
[SPEAKER_10]: One person says it's blueberry.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like it, it changes flavor profiles as
different people like get to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was at a sneaker shop and somebody
opened a red bull and I thought,
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's the blueberry cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I've never smelled anything that had
that same, that made me that familiar with
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a little bit of a red bull sort
of all the blueberry cookies crosses have
[SPEAKER_04]: that, like how Red Bull is almost gross
from far away, but as you get closer,
[SPEAKER_04]: it turns into berries.
[SPEAKER_04]: It had like an energy drink to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it definitely made me think about
blueberry cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was similar to that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey Jeff, I was listening to the most
recent podcast and you use that term wang.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was listening to it in the truck with
Carlos.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's like learning Spanish.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, my wife's wild.
[SPEAKER_14]: But he asked me what, what does wang mean?
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, like what does wang taste like?
[SPEAKER_14]: And I wanted to avoid like like what does
wang taste like?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Describe wang.
[SPEAKER_17]: It doesn't taste like salty.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's at the tip of your tongue.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to rewrite all of the websites
because it can't say wang now.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not like someone's wang.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like some kind of wang.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe tang is the word.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of read you the whole website for
description now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a weird tanginess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Tangy wang.
[SPEAKER_03]: A tangy wang.
[SPEAKER_03]: The old tangy wang.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody got the giggles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that burn?
[SPEAKER_04]: That was burn.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to burn.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope she can hear this.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was, you know, I got to test the
blueberry butcher and I was trying to like
[SPEAKER_11]: pinpoint the berry smells that I was
getting off of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it kept changing throughout the grow,
right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Like early on, I swear I was getting like
some, some like sour cherry smells or
[SPEAKER_11]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think it was like an elderberry or
something.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's not a note that I'm really
terribly familiar with.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's definitely something different
about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not like a fermented, because I've had
plants before they had like that fermented
[SPEAKER_11]: berries or almost like a wine terpene to
it when, when it was finished curing.
[SPEAKER_11]: But this was like a, like a fresh berry
smell to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think on a recent, on a recent show I
said elderberries too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: A squatty fino, huh?
[SPEAKER_11]: That's uncommon.
[SPEAKER_11]: The squatty was like a lemon lime citrus
soda.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did it have a hint of urinal cakes?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd have to check it to see how,
I mean, it's, it's all dry now.
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you know what urinal cakes taste
like?
[SPEAKER_11]: I worked at a bar for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to clean the pisser a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: So are the different colors different?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they the same?
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of them smell like like spearmint
bubbles, spearmint gum or something,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like gummy stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some have a lemon smell.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I had a, I had a lot of berry finos in the
ones that I had, but I also had a lot of
[SPEAKER_11]: those, uh, world, uh, phylo taxi or
whatever, whatever it's called.
[SPEAKER_11]: The, uh, the triple nodes or the triple
brings out each nodes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, which number was that two or four that
does that?
[SPEAKER_04]: One of those does that more than the
other.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's number two that does that
more than the other.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I kept a mail of it and you,
uh, you donated to my breeding project.
[SPEAKER_04]: So already breeding with my unreleased
gear.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Hey, I messaged you a little bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: You might be too high to remember,
but I got your blessing at a time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dave just held up some nuggets.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you showing off there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Dave?
[SPEAKER_13]: This is that blueberry butcher you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'll take a quarter.
[SPEAKER_04]: You really killed that girl, Dave.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was, let me put you up on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: However I do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me pin you here and see if I can make
it happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope he came up on your guys's screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: He came up on mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of phallic like bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: How come everything you're involved in is
a little dick like, what do you want me to
[SPEAKER_13]: tell you, man?
[SPEAKER_04]: He really puts his passion into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It shows you really definitely put your
heart into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of anybody else, anybody else got
any herbs to show off?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got some.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of it's dry and crunchy now
because I've had it for a minute,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I keep going back for this because
they're killing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is double dose.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bred this and it was grown by,
Oh man, I know the grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike knows the name of them too.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're the one, the grow that has the DJ
at their grow all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Indico, Indico, Colorado, double dose.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they sell it at a dispensary near me
for a reasonable price, but they don't let
[SPEAKER_04]: you buy more than a quarter at a time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got to go in there a couple of times
a week and get a quarter.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's the double dose dried flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm digging it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a nice flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little too dry by now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they've had the same batch for a
while, but it's good herb.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have some packs of that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to pop them.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have some, uh, orange.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got too much shit in the garden right
now.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got, I got the blueberry butcher
clones and, uh, I've got blue raspberry
[SPEAKER_11]: truffle.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got a bunch of iry genetics shit in
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Herb's got some nice looking herb.
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of clones, I was actually just
gifted an iry genetics clone.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, one of my local buddies just gifted me
a morning dew clone.
[SPEAKER_19]: Not bad score.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, here we go.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a good gift.
[SPEAKER_10]: And also that's a good buddy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, dude, look at this thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like how, how can you complain when
something like that shows up?
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, who's a happy girl?
[SPEAKER_04]: Really healthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a happy little girl, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a good, you know, type I
recognize that I can recognize that leaf
[SPEAKER_04]: structure.
[SPEAKER_10]: There are, it's a three leaves per node.
[SPEAKER_10]: If that, if that helps any.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a, that one's really easy to trim
too.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's the 191 leaf.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm, I'm excited to, to play with this
one.
[SPEAKER_10]: She's going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's nice too, like, because it's
already been hunted out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like he grew a couple of them.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know it's a girl.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know it's going to be pretty decent.
[SPEAKER_10]: So now, I just get to stick it in my soil
and see how it does.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Learn that girl.
[SPEAKER_04]: See how much nitrogen, phosphorus,
potassium, led light she likes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And growing up under the leds is a whole
new curve for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a very experienced grower and I have
put some plants through the damn ringer
[SPEAKER_04]: learning these leds.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like Raptor and Cuzz got some
weed to show.
[SPEAKER_26]: I was just showing the strawberry
strawberry.
[SPEAKER_24]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bob sounds like a remix.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bob, we can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_12]: He brought up a really good point.
[SPEAKER_04]: What did he say?
[SPEAKER_17]: He was safe within quarantine.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't even hear you guys say it again.
[SPEAKER_19]: The plant in quarantine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a question for you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll take a question.
[SPEAKER_30]: So, um, we're going into the outdoor
season here soon.
[SPEAKER_30]: So, um, what do you think, uh,
Jeff and everyone else, what are the best
[SPEAKER_30]: strains, uh, from my re-genetics to grow
outdoor?
[SPEAKER_30]: If you want to grow some, especially,
uh, strains that would be, you know,
[SPEAKER_30]: really resistant to bud mold.
[SPEAKER_30]: Or a bud rot, uh, maybe somehow don't
attract moths cause moths get out of my
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just gave me a really, uh,
so the strain I was going to say to answer
[SPEAKER_04]: your question, uh, before I do it,
uh, I want to welcome our friend double
[SPEAKER_04]: door dank to the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Double door dank just popped in.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like he's frozen for the time
being, but he's here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to acknowledge him and show some
love.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Rasta Bob, we know you're here,
but your mind keeps cutting out too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So love, much love, enough respect.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys chime in whenever you can.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, but for outdoor, for ivory genetics,
I would definitely recommend the morning
[SPEAKER_04]: dew in almost all locations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, the morning dew, I say it's funny
cause it smells like moth balls and you
[SPEAKER_04]: just said what's going to get the moths
away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, maybe that's got something to do with
why the bugs don't get to it, but it
[SPEAKER_04]: doesn't get mold.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't get mildew.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it grows really well outdoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that morning dew is killer for the
outdoor environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got a longer flowering season,
the sun kiss will do really well for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our buddy double door has got a sun kiss
phenotype in California.
[SPEAKER_04]: It finishes in like 55, 60 days that just
crushes it, fills up the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, they're paying the fucking bills off
that sun kiss.
[SPEAKER_04]: He threw up a thumbs up in the chat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you guys can see that,
but he put up a thumbs up in response to
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, that sun kiss is killing it out there
in California.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get pictures and reports of people from
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, the morning dew, the sun kiss,
and then probably the orange guys,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you have a longer, longer flowering
season.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you guys would kill with the orange
guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would kill it out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I was about to ask.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: I was about to ask Bob if he, if he ran
any of your stuff out there and like what
[SPEAKER_17]: he does.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_29]: What's up, Jeff?
[SPEAKER_29]: What's up, Steve?
[SPEAKER_29]: What's up, man?
[SPEAKER_29]: It's good to see you, bro.
[SPEAKER_29]: Fucking hell, man.
[SPEAKER_29]: I haven't seen Steve since fucking AboExpo
or the dab concentrate event where he was
[SPEAKER_29]: at.
[SPEAKER_29]: We were all getting fucking, you know,
dab down.
[SPEAKER_29]: That was a fun time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably the last time we all got to hang
out together, man.
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, that was a lot of fun, man.
[SPEAKER_29]: Fucking Steve was down there fucking,
you know, shouting out his, uh,
[SPEAKER_29]: running with fishes podcast.
[SPEAKER_29]: I've been listening quite a bit to that.
[SPEAKER_29]: I got to say, man, I'm really impressed
with all that information.
[SPEAKER_29]: You know, I passed that on to many people.
[SPEAKER_28]: Uh, I'm pretty, pretty excited,
man.
[SPEAKER_28]: I've been promoting.
[SPEAKER_28]: You got your podcast like a motherfucker,
dude.
[SPEAKER_28]: Uh, there's a lot of people who want to
use that.
[SPEAKER_28]: There's natural, uh, you know,
uh, fish microbials to power the farm.
[SPEAKER_28]: So I'm pretty excited, man.
[SPEAKER_28]: That's awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I turned off your camera because it was,
I turned off your camera because your wifi
[SPEAKER_04]: was killing you, but you sound much better
now that we can't see you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got a face for radio anyway,
brother.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to double down real quick.
[SPEAKER_28]: Hopefully you guys can hear me right now.
[SPEAKER_28]: We can hear you, bro.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to double down on what he said
about watching Steve's content because
[SPEAKER_11]: even if you're not going to grow with
fishes, you'll definitely learn something.
[SPEAKER_11]: Watching Steve's content.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I've, I've even adopted the whole
dual, dual root zone thing now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I've got my pots and trays full of
hydroton.
[SPEAKER_04]: The dude knows a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's very well-educated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Never, uh, never misjudge a dread.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it when I walk in with the dreads
and people think I'm not going to know
[SPEAKER_04]: shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I re-school them on their entire
fucking grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the funnest thing to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can learn a lot from my brother,
Steve.
[SPEAKER_21]: I appreciate it guys.
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry about the dog there for a second,
but yeah, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's family too, bro.
[SPEAKER_21]: The dog is family.
[SPEAKER_04]: The dog's on the show now.
[SPEAKER_04]: The dog's famous.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Steve's probably gotten, uh,
Steve's probably got some of the highest
[SPEAKER_28]: level of, you know, how do you deal with
the moisture?
[SPEAKER_28]: The amount of fucking moisture that you
deal with the, uh, the humidities that
[SPEAKER_28]: keep that going that, you know,
you're constantly running fluid through,
[SPEAKER_28]: you know, how do you guys deal with that?
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, on an aquaponics level.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've molded up a house with just a
fish tank.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a pretty good question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Ross De Bob said anything to the
platinum tangy, uh, orange gasm or sun
[SPEAKER_04]: kiss is great outdoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ross De Bob also made a good point.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said Prana is another one that could
take it great outdoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, that's absolutely, absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Prana finishes early.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it's got blueberry and flow and a rise
in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's potent.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's vigorous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, but it's very limited in quantity on
seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure where you'll be able to find
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a couple of packs left.
[SPEAKER_04]: So good luck finding the Prana.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, but that one kills it outdoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely crushes.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: So with the, uh, with the humidity,
it generally makes it pretty easy to
[SPEAKER_21]: maintain BPD in a place like Colorado,
where it's so dry.
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, but definitely can be an issue,
um, uh, at nighttime, mainly.
[SPEAKER_21]: So we do, you know, definitely have to
make sure we have dehumidifiers or a good
[SPEAKER_21]: airflow at nighttime.
[SPEAKER_21]: But that's the biggest thing.
[SPEAKER_21]: Plus just proper pruning and making sure
you have, you know, cultivars that are
[SPEAKER_21]: adapted to it.
[SPEAKER_21]: And finding some pinos, uh, in your
cultivars that you're looking for,
[SPEAKER_21]: that are a little bit, you know,
more, more humid tolerant, um,
[SPEAKER_21]: you know, trying to stick to more
equatorial strains, similarly growing in,
[SPEAKER_21]: even in Oklahoma is similar to,
right?
[SPEAKER_21]: You have higher humidity or Texas or
anywhere on the Gulf coast.
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to have higher humidity,
uh, and you know, it's over Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_21]: You guys are down in Jamaica and Trinity.
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, uh, you guys are very similar growth
climate in terms of humidity and heat.
[SPEAKER_28]: So we'll see, like I'm in Santa Cruz,
man.
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm right on the coast.
[SPEAKER_28]: Literally.
[SPEAKER_28]: We had, we get a lot of ocean winds and a
lot of, uh, you know, a lot of that fog
[SPEAKER_28]: coming off the ocean at nights and stuff.
[SPEAKER_28]: And we get, you know, tremendous amounts
of humidity spice at night.
[SPEAKER_28]: And so there's a lot of people here trying
to do the aquaponics thing at the same
[SPEAKER_28]: time.
[SPEAKER_28]: Uh, you know, any advice for people,
you know, growing greenhouse that are
[SPEAKER_28]: trying to do this, uh, you know,
you know, symbiotic in the kind of high
[SPEAKER_28]: humidity environment, other than,
you know, I, I know dehumidification is
[SPEAKER_28]: probably key to everything, but you know,
uh, you know, just some simple advice to
[SPEAKER_28]: some of the people in the higher humidity
environments.
[SPEAKER_21]: The other big thing I would say is going
to be ultra critical and high humidity
[SPEAKER_21]: environments is relying heavily on
geothermal over wet walls because
[SPEAKER_21]: geothermal will operate just fine in high
humidity environments, whereas wet walls
[SPEAKER_21]: are horribly inefficient and humid,
humid environment.
[SPEAKER_21]: So, you know, if you have cooler ground or
even even better, if you have a cool
[SPEAKER_21]: aquifer and you can pull like in Jamaica,
for example, underground, it's still 70,
[SPEAKER_21]: 72 degrees, right?
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not that much cooler because it's the
tropics.
[SPEAKER_21]: But if you find an aquifer, that aquifer
is much cooler.
[SPEAKER_21]: So if you can pull water up from
underground and circulate that through
[SPEAKER_21]: either a heat exchanger attached to a wet
wall to basically chill that wet wall or
[SPEAKER_21]: to have it attached directly to the slab
or through a heat exchanger in your grow
[SPEAKER_21]: beds.
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, for yourself, you can actually,
you know, do it that way to cool
[SPEAKER_21]: everything down and be very efficient,
even in a very humid place like the
[SPEAKER_21]: Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_21]: Hell yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, one of the things that I ran into
majorly.
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh shit, my bad.
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sorry, man.
[SPEAKER_28]: I didn't mean to over talk you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but you're good, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to interrupt both of you guys
though.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to interrupt everybody so we can
welcome Mr. Bag Seed to the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: What up, Mr. Bag Seed?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Mr. Bag Seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cheers, Bag Seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: What up, my brother?
[SPEAKER_04]: How's it going, bag?
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, Jeff, activate my video.
[SPEAKER_27]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_27]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_28]: Activate my video.
[SPEAKER_28]: It says it's inactive.
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh yeah, it turns you off.
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, it chops up your...
[SPEAKER_28]: I got a good wifi now.
[SPEAKER_28]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_28]: You should be ready to go.
[SPEAKER_28]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_28]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_28]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there he is.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's that sexy face coming from Cali,
bro.
[SPEAKER_28]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_28]: Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_28]: We're in the dojo right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so you're coming in from Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_04]: How can we follow you on social media,
Matt?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just give people your social media real
quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been letting people plug their social
media when they come in.
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_28]: Friendly Fire Farms.
[SPEAKER_28]: Uh, Friendly Fire Farms is what I've got
going on right now.
[SPEAKER_28]: I've got outdoor greenhouse and indoor
running right now.
[SPEAKER_28]: I've got three different sections and
we're running each pretty successfully out
[SPEAKER_28]: here as well as I've got people in North
California.
[SPEAKER_28]: I almost say Colorado.
[SPEAKER_28]: It's so funny.
[SPEAKER_28]: I live in Colorado for so long.
[SPEAKER_28]: I can't stop saying it, but I got people
up in North California above Sacramento
[SPEAKER_28]: also running a lot of Jeff's stuff and as
well as a lot of some of my stuff.
[SPEAKER_28]: So I'm pretty proud right now.
[SPEAKER_28]: One of the biggest things, Steve,
man, I'll tell you what, there's been more
[SPEAKER_28]: questions about aquaponics down here than
you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_28]: And I've had to answer so much shit and I
just keep saying grow with fishes.
[SPEAKER_28]: You need to check out the podcast because
like, if you really want to know how to do
[SPEAKER_28]: this, this is how you're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_28]: Because symbiotic aquaponics is not
something you just walk into.
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a, it's definitely a process that I
think people need to understand the amount
[SPEAKER_28]: of bacteria you need to build up the
amount of, you know, like, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: to, to properly aquaponics and that's kind
of grown for like 12 years, 20 years,
[SPEAKER_04]: 40 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And aquaponics is like a completely
different thing to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know the first step about
aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I would be, if you're like,
send me up in aquaponics, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd go, well, here's Steve's card.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how I would set up aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to cut you off so we can talk to
Mr. Bag seed real quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to talk to Bagsy.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up Mr. Bagsy?
[SPEAKER_04]: He looks sexy as fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a fresh haircut.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's back from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got that giant bong in his lap.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's also muted.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can't hear a damn thing he's saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I keep muting.
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't want to make, yeah, I don't want
to make noise.
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_27]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_27]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_27]: You can make noise.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a podcast, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, when people have been coming in,
I've been, uh, been being polite and
[SPEAKER_04]: letting us, uh, letting them tell us where
they're coming from and how we can find
[SPEAKER_04]: them on social media.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can get you some social media
followers.
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_27]: I am from Missouri.
[SPEAKER_27]: I live in Missouri right now.
[SPEAKER_27]: You can sound more enthusiastic about it.
[SPEAKER_27]: Dude, I kind of had something to drink.
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm probably a little slower.
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm a caregiver out here.
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, yeah, I'm in Missouri.
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_27]: Hanging out.
[SPEAKER_27]: We hang out in the neighborhood all the
time.
[SPEAKER_27]: I know you come through, uh, we have the
new, uh, YouTube channel, the,
[SPEAKER_27]: uh, neighborhood grows that we're starting
up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, let's call that real quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's been mentioning it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess now is a good time since we got,
uh, in my opinion, you're the fucking like
[SPEAKER_04]: the leader of the hood.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're the Mr. Rogers, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to get you a silly sweater.
[SPEAKER_27]: We just hang around.
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's about association.
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, everyone, everyone who comes
through, yeah, that's the part of the
[SPEAKER_27]: neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_27]: We all just kind of hang out and talk and
help each other.
[SPEAKER_27]: That's, you know, it's really,
I learned it from you.
[SPEAKER_27]: It became, I mean, you know, when I
started, but like, I basically got all
[SPEAKER_27]: that from you, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, your whole growing mentality and
everything is easy for me to catch on to.
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, you know, I watched the Michigan bros
and everybody, it's really how I found all
[SPEAKER_27]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_27]: And it's really, you know, how everyone
comes together.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, everyone who comes through the hood,
you know, I fucking love everybody and
[SPEAKER_27]: everyone I watch.
[SPEAKER_27]: I love you guys too, even though I don't
know you, but, uh, yeah, I mean,
[SPEAKER_27]: that's kind of what we're about.
[SPEAKER_27]: We just kind of hang around and talk about
everything.
[SPEAKER_27]: And then we have good topics to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_27]: So we want to, you know, go live.
[SPEAKER_27]: So that's kind of what I can't wait for
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So tell us about the going live part.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us about this live four 20 show that
the hoods do.
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, we're going to start.
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, we're just, yeah, we're all just
going to hang out on the four 20 show,
[SPEAKER_27]: but we're going to start out as a show.
[SPEAKER_27]: We're going to do like beginner grows,
helping people, you know, at starting out
[SPEAKER_27]: beginner grows and whatnot, and then go
from there, you know, up to what Raptor
[SPEAKER_27]: knows.
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, Raptor knows a ton of knowledge,
GMF, everybody that comes into the hood
[SPEAKER_27]: has so much good knowledge.
[SPEAKER_27]: So if we can just keep all that going,
that's kind of what, what we're trying to
[SPEAKER_27]: do, you know, go live shows, having more
shows and more people feed off of ideas is
[SPEAKER_27]: what all this is about.
[SPEAKER_27]: So, um, that's, that's, that's what I'm,
you know, I don't know everything.
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm a newer grower.
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm a salt grower.
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm, you know, I, I do, uh, I love growing
and I want to learn more.
[SPEAKER_27]: And it's cool being around all you guys.
[SPEAKER_27]: So that's, that's really, uh, yeah,
it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_27]: You learn quickly.
[SPEAKER_27]: You learn very quickly.
[SPEAKER_27]: And your video skills are rad.
[SPEAKER_27]: Like you're definitely skilled with video
audio.
[SPEAKER_26]: His production is off the chain.
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, that'd be fine.
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm pretty excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, somebody dipped out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_04]: We lost somebody.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll smoke to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not even ready for what's about to
happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you guys, I just allowed somebody into
this chat and it's going to break the
[SPEAKER_04]: whole chat.
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, she's connecting audio.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like she's here.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up guys?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_04]: You sound good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Where are you coming from?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like that time firing up,
firing up some, uh, orange gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in honor of, uh, in honor of the
podcast tonight for four 20 and Pearl.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you say your name is Pearl?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reminds me of a necklace I had once.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to have to keep saying
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've told everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, where are you coming in from tonight?
[SPEAKER_04]: And how do we find you on social media,
miss painted lady?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am coming in from actually a meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got out of a meeting and,
um, everybody can find me on Instagram at
[SPEAKER_00]: painted lady gardens and cannabis at
painted lady 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe I'm over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Michigan bros grow show, Michigan bros
grow show Sunday and Monday nights.
[SPEAKER_04]: Were there 12 other painted ladies?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, 13 is just my number.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like 13 pearls in that necklace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, don't make me a hoe.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to talk about a girl.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is getting strange.
[SPEAKER_11]: I had a question for Steve, actually.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've seen the large scale aquaponics
setups that he's done firsthand.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the smallest you could possibly do.
[SPEAKER_11]: Could you do like a goldfish tank for
Dan's setup?
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, so we, the smallest I've actually
grown anything on aquaponics, about two
[SPEAKER_21]: and a half gallon tank.
[SPEAKER_21]: I grew four had the lettuce, but as far as
cannabis, the smallest, we were able to
[SPEAKER_21]: get a cannabis plant grow with,
uh, uh, what would normally be considered
[SPEAKER_21]: an appropriate amount of fish or not.
[SPEAKER_21]: In an aquarium was about 40 gallons.
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, uh, just in terms of it, it takes so
much biomass of fish to create enough
[SPEAKER_21]: biomass of, uh, fish manure.
[SPEAKER_21]: I think if you have a 10 gallon or 20
gallon guppy tank, uh, that was just
[SPEAKER_21]: packed to the brim.
[SPEAKER_21]: You probably make it work, but I,
you know, I'm not going to tell people to
[SPEAKER_21]: do that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that'd be kind of unethical
treatment to the guppies, even though they
[SPEAKER_11]: are guppies, but like, I was just curious
because like, how could, uh, your average
[SPEAKER_11]: home grower or hobbyist grower adopt an
aquaponics system without filling their
[SPEAKER_11]: garage full of fish?
[SPEAKER_21]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_21]: So you could just take an over the flow,
uh, overflow aquarium filter box.
[SPEAKER_21]: You get for a saltwater aquarium or drill
your tank really into glass.
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, but most people just buy an overflow
tank, run that down to your sub tank,
[SPEAKER_21]: uh, and then run a return pump to either,
uh, up to your fish tank.
[SPEAKER_21]: And then you either run a second pump to
your flood and drain table or run that on
[SPEAKER_21]: a bell siphon or loop siphons.
[SPEAKER_21]: You don't, you know, everything can run
continuing, but yeah, it's super simple.
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I mean, it's not a, not a lot of
work.
[SPEAKER_21]: If you already have a grow tank,
a grow tray and a sub tank, it's literally
[SPEAKER_21]: like a trip to the saltwater fish store
and you can have that up and running at
[SPEAKER_21]: about half an hour.
[SPEAKER_21]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_21]: So I always thought it was way more than
that.
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_28]: That's awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_28]: I didn't know if you had to develop like
quite a bit of culture before they started
[SPEAKER_28]: actually being efficient and you know,
how much, you know, bacteria you had to
[SPEAKER_28]: develop before that starts becoming,
you know, irrelevant, uh, feeding,
[SPEAKER_21]: you know, regimen, you know, fish for,
the same way that you would cycle or
[SPEAKER_21]: mature a good living soil bed.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's the same thing you do with the
aquarium or an aquaponics and you just
[SPEAKER_21]: stop populating those microbes the same
way we would when we inoculate our gardens
[SPEAKER_21]: in the springtime and our soil beds.
[SPEAKER_21]: Very similar.
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good to know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Don DeGrova's comments in the chat.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, guys, I think we got
interrupted when we were talking about
[SPEAKER_04]: what everybody's going to do for 420.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that Doug's on lockdown.
[SPEAKER_04]: After that, I think we totally got off the
rails and abandoned that whole topic and
[SPEAKER_04]: started talking about aquaponics and
fucking who knows what else.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember because I've been smoking
as much as you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I invited you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew I would need content.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know I would need all the content
off the rails.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, look, look who's joining us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me allow somebody into the room here
before we ask this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: But everybody think about what you're
going to do for 420 because after I do
[SPEAKER_04]: this intro here, we're going to talk about
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's connecting.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is here.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's live in the chat.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's wearing some death metal shirt today.
[SPEAKER_04]: What you got going on?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's welcome to the room, my buddy,
Blacksail Market.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, Keith, here in the show,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're muted, brother.
[SPEAKER_20]: Happy 420, everybody.
[SPEAKER_20]: Look at this fucking crowd.
[SPEAKER_20]: Happy 420.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a barrel of monkeys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so glad everyone made it.
[SPEAKER_28]: Fashionably ladies here, Blacksail,
Rasta Fogg, smoking down on their
challenge.
[SPEAKER_28]: Where are you coming in from?
[SPEAKER_04]: How can people find you on social media,
Keith?
[SPEAKER_20]: Blacksail Market on Cannabuzz,
which is a fucking phenomenal app.
[SPEAKER_20]: Every grower should be on there.
[SPEAKER_20]: Blacksail Market on Instagram,
Keith at blacksailmarket.com or just
[SPEAKER_20]: blacksailmarket.com.
[SPEAKER_20]: Hit me up with your LED questions.
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to do a full episode with
Keith pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: This Zoom meeting here is kind of a
practice run to get good at doing Zoom
[SPEAKER_04]: meetings with other people.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think I got the hang of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was able to manage 22 people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I can do a one-on-one show now
with Keith.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get a lot of you guys on shows
one-on-one now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keith, thank you for joining us,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't let anybody pick on you for being
late.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said come one, come all, come whenever
you can.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm glad people made it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm going to ask the question that's
been pending.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only person I know what they're doing
for 420 is Duck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because he said fucking lockdown because
the beaches are closed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Duck, I hope you get somebody on that
couch by the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just drop that in there real quick.
[SPEAKER_17]: We have some book spaces tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_17]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_17]: What is anybody else doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Keith just popped in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any plans for 420 or are you
stuck in the house because of the the
[SPEAKER_04]: Pandy?
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll probably end up going over to Nasys
and getting stoned.
[SPEAKER_20]: That's pretty much what I do for fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're going to take a dab and then
take a nap on the dog bed, huh?
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, man, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a party.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great time for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many dabs will you take throughout the
day?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like three, maybe four?
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I take a lot of dabs throughout the
day, but I take like tiny little baby
[SPEAKER_20]: dabs, dude.
[SPEAKER_20]: Like one Pedro dab is like a fucking
week's worth all at once.
[SPEAKER_20]: And so I get very pale and then I pass
out.
[SPEAKER_11]: You take half of a half dab.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a micro dab.
[SPEAKER_27]: He's micro dabbing.
[SPEAKER_27]: He's micro dabbing.
[SPEAKER_26]: I hear half quarter dabs are all the rage
in Canada.
[SPEAKER_12]: Dab straight there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Half quarters all around.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you're crazy, eh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Miss Painted Lady, I know you're
out there on that other coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any plans for the 420 or are
you trapped indoors because of the Pandy?
[SPEAKER_00]: What fucking coast do you think I'm on?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in Michigan, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I said, where are you earlier?
[SPEAKER_04]: You said you came from a meeting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thought you were just dodging your
location and leaving that a secret.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was just going to go with... No,
I'm in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on the Michigan Bro's Grow Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, I'm in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't know where in Michigan I am.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, but... I don't know,
nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kid Rock came from Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He picked the worst one.
[SPEAKER_04]: One more time and I'm going to mute your
mic.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, don't remind me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to hang out with the Michigan
Bros?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just had an event at Sequence's
Housewarming not too long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when was that, Sequence?
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of weeks ago, I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to do another event because
basically our pandemic bubble has been our
[SPEAKER_05]: group.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've done a bunch of events with just our
group of people and we smoke and stuff and
[SPEAKER_05]: it's went well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll probably do something for 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't planned anything yet,
though.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's normal.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have a repeat.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only five days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why start planning now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have an event coming up,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have a... What was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Luzerne event, Bigfoot Lodge, where we're
going to do... What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sequence?
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to be vending and stuff at an
event in Northern Michigan and then
[SPEAKER_05]: camping overnight.
[SPEAKER_05]: In July.
[SPEAKER_05]: Vending three different days in July.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Events are going to come back soon,
sometime.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: I miss events and concerts and just going
up to Denver to dab on Tenasi's couch
[SPEAKER_04]: would be a good time right now.
[SPEAKER_28]: I will say they had a comedy event at the
Dispo the other day, which was pretty
[SPEAKER_28]: cool.
[SPEAKER_28]: They had five comics.
[SPEAKER_28]: They called it from other states and it
was just nice to see live events again.
[SPEAKER_28]: It was outdoor, but it was still nice to
see Dispo putting on barbecues and having
[SPEAKER_28]: these fucking fun events again.
[SPEAKER_28]: It kind of reminded me of before the whole
COVID thing.
[SPEAKER_28]: It was really nice.
[SPEAKER_28]: People were in truck beds just watching
this.
[SPEAKER_28]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_28]: It was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm hoping that we're going to improve a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so ready for events.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how long it'll be before I go
to big, big events, but small medium
[SPEAKER_04]: events, I'm ready to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to take a while for people to
remember how to act.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not ready to go to big, big stuff yet,
but medium stuff I'm in.
[SPEAKER_04]: There may be a medium-sized event coming
up in May that I'll start advertising here
[SPEAKER_04]: really soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just got to send that final agreement.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to write the check and then I'll
start advertising.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a thing in Denver, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys coming up in May, be prepared.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mike said, shh.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to say, I think the last time
we all hung out together was actually at
[SPEAKER_11]: Frosty McNuggets' house, not Tenasi's.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's how damn down you were.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying it would be nice just to
go sit on Tenasi's couch with the dogs and
[SPEAKER_04]: Tenasi and Keith would be a fucking party
at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_04]: The most company I've had in the past few
months has been Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: No offense to Mike, but we've seen each
other, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple other people would be cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely remember that everybody got
the COVID.
[SPEAKER_04]: Frosty McNuggets' house.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do remember we all shared it that night.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's nodding their head like,
yeah, we all went home and got sick.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys got sick.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't get sick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dick Donut, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you guys remember the Dick Donut?
[SPEAKER_15]: Dick Donut was legendary.
[SPEAKER_15]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody that wasn't there is lost now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Cascadia and Grown just went live on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: If anybody wants to tell them that the
party's over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: That event you guys described sounds like
one of the ones that we would have done
[SPEAKER_05]: here, so it's nice to know those sorts of
community.
[SPEAKER_05]: Communities still exist all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a thing we try to foster a lot over
here in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't stop the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_04]: There definitely are a lot of restrictions
and loopholes right now, but you can't
[SPEAKER_04]: stop us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're a bunch of underground.
[SPEAKER_04]: The growers and breeders have always been
a bunch of underground rebels.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was just something legal,
so we've still got a rebel mindset.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a rule breaker mindset.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were always that kid in school that was
late and stoned and didn't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't feel tardy.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was always us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Still is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Double door showing off his swords.
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, we do weapons training down here.
[SPEAKER_28]: This is actually a fucking.
[SPEAKER_28]: This is actually a dojo for karate school
at the bottom of the place I live at,
[SPEAKER_28]: and they do weapons training karate school
down here and it's fucking insane.
[SPEAKER_28]: If you've never seen guys fight with
fucking full on staffs and you know swords
[SPEAKER_28]: like that shit's insane like straight
sweep the leg.
[SPEAKER_28]: We have all of these here.
[SPEAKER_28]: These are the practice swords and then we
have more behind me and they have arm
[SPEAKER_28]: weights and shit they wear while they do
the sword fight.
[SPEAKER_28]: It's insane, bro.
[SPEAKER_28]: We have a full outdoor section.
[SPEAKER_28]: Where is the pad where they fight?
[SPEAKER_28]: It's nuts, man.
[SPEAKER_28]: If you've never watched guys fucking do
weapons training for Kung Fu, it's fucking
[SPEAKER_28]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't just show that video and you're
like bro at my new house.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got all this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's too high.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Matt ate mushrooms and got
creative and told us a story, but then you
[SPEAKER_05]: just panned through a really great
commercial bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: If shit goes down, can I come there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was hoping he was going to pick
something up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a kick ass bell over there.
[SPEAKER_28]: This is one of the staffs.
[SPEAKER_28]: It's like three and a half feet long.
[SPEAKER_28]: This is one of the ones that you fight
with and train with.
[SPEAKER_28]: Really gnarly as shit.
[SPEAKER_28]: This is a YMH heavy segment.
[SPEAKER_28]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_28]: Smoking pot.
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm six foot two.
[SPEAKER_28]: So when you see these behind me,
those are six feet tall.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it looks like a Naginta.
[SPEAKER_30]: It's like all the weapons from that
Chateau fight scene in The Matrix where
[SPEAKER_28]: they like, oh yeah, you guys remember the
wristbands from fucking the Kung Fu,
[SPEAKER_28]: what is it called?
[SPEAKER_28]: A fucking, that like almost funny movie
where they'd have the wristbands to block
[SPEAKER_28]: all the shit and the metal bands.
[SPEAKER_28]: That's not a wristband.
[SPEAKER_28]: Put that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call me Bruce.
[SPEAKER_10]: Put that down and wash your hands.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_28]: We have practice swords too.
[SPEAKER_28]: These are the ones that don't kill you
when you get hit by them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they smoke when they train?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they smoke when they're practicing and
shit or do they go in there just white
[SPEAKER_04]: eyed and bushy tailed?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, they smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they smoke bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever seen, have they ever made
each other bleed?
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, do you have a stitches kit?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like does anybody there know how to apply
a tourniquet and stitches?
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, we don't do first aid.
[SPEAKER_28]: Um isn't the answer.
[SPEAKER_28]: When somebody starts bleeding,
the answer is they don't get um.
[SPEAKER_08]: Superglue and duct tape.
[SPEAKER_27]: It comes with um.
[SPEAKER_27]: I guess I'm the only one certified CPR.
[SPEAKER_28]: They're dead outside training area.
[SPEAKER_28]: That's a weird looking.
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_27]: You must be Jeet Kune Do there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys have sex rooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I was thinking.
[SPEAKER_20]: Real creepy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I could not go roll without smoking.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I was supposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that sword and I raised him a sword.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you're raising my sword with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a little guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is JTR.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: You show that plant because when you
brought it out on the show the other
[SPEAKER_11]: night, I was thinking of Dirtman Dan.
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, painted lady's holding a beautiful
plant.
[SPEAKER_28]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_28]: What are you holding right now?
[SPEAKER_28]: This is the Jack the River F2.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_28]: Number two or number four?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, F2.
[SPEAKER_28]: Never mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking with Jeff.
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm fucking with Jeff.
[SPEAKER_27]: I love Jeff.
[SPEAKER_27]: That's awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's like a dildo.
[SPEAKER_27]: She's like dangling it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a gorgeous dildo.
[SPEAKER_27]: Look at this thing.
[SPEAKER_28]: It's so flowery.
[SPEAKER_28]: That was like an auto plant.
[SPEAKER_28]: The way it flowered, it almost looked like
an auto plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's just in a cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that thing vegs real short.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly how I describe it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It grows that bottom bush and then it just
takes off and makes that leader top.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple other in three gallons
right now that are, they've got about the
[SPEAKER_00]: same Christmas tree structure that are
doing really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm stoked to see how those turn out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the biggest, what's the biggest
size pot you're using right now is?
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 gals.
[SPEAKER_04]: 10 gals.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's too big.
[SPEAKER_04]: That gets crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: How long are you going to let those
flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, those aren't in 10 gal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are only in three gals right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're only in veg, but, um, I go,
but they, those cups flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The solo cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This only has a couple more weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the cannabis challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the cannabis challenge.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some good prizes up in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to win, but I thought she
was cute.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was my first time I ever did that
attitude is that I'm not going to win.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why fucking interview?
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to be like, I'm going to win.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to crush this contest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck everybody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the champ.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_04]: Start spinning the prize money.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got some second place attitude.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to have a first place attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's my first place attitude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why you're one of my favorite
fucking girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some of the other cups and
they're doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just didn't really push her that
hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was going to be the thumbnail of
this episode is painted lady with her
[SPEAKER_04]: finger up at me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's what I'm going to try to put
up on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, she's throwing down right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's somebody to keep me in line.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody went and gave him the message.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys for whoever did that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to assume it was Raptor with all
that responsibility.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's coming in.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll introduce him here as soon as he
gets the camera going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe here's Cascadia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Cascadian girl popping in.
[SPEAKER_04]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cascadian.
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey guys.
[SPEAKER_18]: Glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Glad somebody passed you the invite.
[SPEAKER_28]: Bunch of great people in here tonight.
[SPEAKER_28]: Where are you coming from Cascadian?
[SPEAKER_18]: I am in the Cascades, man.
[SPEAKER_18]: It makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew up in the Cascades for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes more sense than anything I've
ever heard tonight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, what's your Instagram handle so people
can follow you if they want to stalk you
[SPEAKER_04]: while you're on here.
[SPEAKER_18]: If they're looking for me, man,
you catch me at Cascadian ground.
[SPEAKER_18]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give him a follow.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's doing some cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any photos of the thing you're
working on?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we talk about your project,
your separator?
[SPEAKER_18]: So that one you'll find at at Cascadian
Hort, H-O-R-T.
[SPEAKER_18]: That is the horticulture company that I
started.
[SPEAKER_18]: I separated that out from the rest of
everything else that's going on.
[SPEAKER_18]: So yeah, we can talk about it,
man.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm really excited about it.
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a couple.
[SPEAKER_26]: That's at Cascadian Hort Instagram,
right?
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, that's the Instagram handle at
Cascadian Hort.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm working on a seed cleaner,
an electric seed cleaner.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm assuming that's what you're alluding
to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm pretty excited about it.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's handmade.
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's been a good time.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's been a learning experience.
[SPEAKER_18]: I've had to make a prototype or two and
alter the designs a little bit,
[SPEAKER_18]: but I'm happy with where it is now.
[SPEAKER_18]: I just have to put the final design
together and I'll have prototype videos up
[SPEAKER_18]: and running.
[SPEAKER_18]: The model itself is very well proven.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's actually open source.
[SPEAKER_18]: So the only thing I'm really selling is
not the model.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not a secret.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just my labor and parts.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the only reason for a markup is my
labor and parts.
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's very time-tested design.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_18]: They use it a lot in bird breeding because
they can't waste the food.
[SPEAKER_18]: So they have to recover their costs from
the seed that the birds eat.
[SPEAKER_18]: They have to clean that out of the seed
that they just spill.
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's made for all size seeds because
they don't use one in particular seed.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's always a mix.
[SPEAKER_18]: So it works for all kinds of seeds.
[SPEAKER_18]: It should be pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_18]: I just got to dial it in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good product.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen it and I know where the idea
came from and I know the idea is solid.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope you have great success with
that, Ron.
[SPEAKER_04]: When they're ready, I'm definitely going
to be looking at one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a seed cleaner now, but you can
always put them side by side and clean
[SPEAKER_04]: twice as many seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: Appreciate it, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for letting me have a moment to
talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to support the community here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to support the community.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, if you're just a regular grower,
not just a regular grower, I'm not trying
[SPEAKER_04]: to downplay a grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a grower that's got a trim,
your version of trimming, which you guys
[SPEAKER_04]: call trim gel, which I find disrespectful
to anybody that's been in real jail,
[SPEAKER_04]: where you're listening to sublime and
eating Cheetos, quit saying trim gel.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you guys that are in trim gel,
the breeder's version is cleaning seeds
[SPEAKER_04]: and packing seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is our version.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to get on 32 hours of Netflix and
just be prepared and have 12 bottles of
[SPEAKER_04]: water and just go to cleaning and packing
seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's our version.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that machine he's making, is definitely
useful, helpful for somebody in our
[SPEAKER_04]: position.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, good work, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody else here do any breeding?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is it just me?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking around to see who we're
playing with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking for some ladies, any single
ladies.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're always put some stains on that
couch, bro.
[SPEAKER_20]: I've been called a breeder before,
but it was in a different context.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did your pullout game this week?
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard Burp say that he's doing some
pollen dusting.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you doing over there,
Burp?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I dusted a little pollen on pretty
much everything in my flower right now
[SPEAKER_08]: today.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've dusted some, well, I'm not going to
spill the beans right now, but I put it
[SPEAKER_08]: onto a bunch of iry stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm collecting some, what is it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Blue raspberry truffle pollen as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was the baby daddy in this breeding run
iry?
[SPEAKER_04]: Regenetics or another breeder?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I was another breeder.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's cool because all my shit's
like, if you keep breeding with mine,
[SPEAKER_04]: you bottleneck yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm reaching far out, far out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The further out, the better.
[SPEAKER_04]: I promise you, I will.
[SPEAKER_04]: I trust your selections.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen what you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody else out there breeding or just
just our man Burp?
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Silence in the breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: Either one of you guys, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just saying I wanted to breed later.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I have STS and I have pollen that
I've collected and I made one cross that
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm testing now, but I'm no breeder or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're doing your breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're making vets breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want anybody to tell you
otherwise.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, yeah, you're learning it.
[SPEAKER_21]: Like I'm doing some open pollination right
now.
[SPEAKER_21]: I have some really awesome seeds I got in
Zimbabwe up in the hills.
[SPEAKER_21]: Some really cool sativas.
[SPEAKER_21]: Doing some open pollination with that to
try and batch them out so we can give a
[SPEAKER_21]: bunch of them out.
[SPEAKER_21]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: You said cool sativas.
[SPEAKER_04]: How long are those flowering?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the million dollar question.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really curious about some Zimbabwe
sativa.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to guess 12 weeks, dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to say 16.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to guess 16.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, 12 is pretty weak.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very ambitious guys.
[SPEAKER_21]: I picked these early or I guess they'd be
late in the summer, early in the fall
[SPEAKER_21]: their time.
[SPEAKER_21]: So they actually would be equivalent to us
would kind of be like early September
[SPEAKER_21]: finishers.
[SPEAKER_21]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_21]: I also have no idea when they were
planted.
[SPEAKER_21]: I just happened to be in the right place
at the right time and get a nice tour of a
[SPEAKER_21]: farm where I was going through and they
were mature seeds.
[SPEAKER_21]: So obviously, you know, paper planes found
a way to follow up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big respect for all the work you do moving
genetics around.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only way that I need to say
that, but big respect for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: As a seed breeder and somebody trying to
move seeds around, I know your struggle,
[SPEAKER_04]: brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Cass, I saw you raise your hand
and say that you're breeding some seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Cascadian, I'll give you a chance to
talk about your breeding project if you
[SPEAKER_04]: want to go for it now.
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, dude, I got a whole ball of wax.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just getting ready to crack into.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going back.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going back in time.
[SPEAKER_18]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to land race heirloom genetics
and getting out of what I call the box,
[SPEAKER_18]: which is cams, diesels, OGs, all that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I'm going back to to some land races
and mixing pretty particular land races
[SPEAKER_18]: with my environment in mind.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm really focused on the Pakistani and
Afghanis Hindu Kush and mixing that with
[SPEAKER_18]: Himalayan genetics, Nepalese, Manipuri,
Burma, the really wet stuff so that I can
[SPEAKER_18]: get the yield and the hash from the
Hindus, but the mold resistance and the
[SPEAKER_18]: structure from the Himalayas and really
nice.
[SPEAKER_18]: And those from my area.
[SPEAKER_04]: So so many people, so many people overlook
the resistance part.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just want Instagram ability.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm glad you're talking about
resistance early on in your breeding
[SPEAKER_04]: instead of I'm going to find a phenotype
that sells weed on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it's all about now.
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I mean, I want to breed for the
future, for the day that the plant is set
[SPEAKER_18]: free and you can put it outside.
[SPEAKER_18]: And we need to develop regional cultivars
and regional like genetic families.
[SPEAKER_18]: It doesn't just need to be a single
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_18]: It needs to be interrelated families that
are regional, like Appalachian style,
[SPEAKER_18]: where they thrive in that environment.
[SPEAKER_18]: And they might thrive in other
environments, but they're cultivated for
[SPEAKER_18]: that environment so that the day that the
cuffs come off, we we can just take our
[SPEAKER_18]: seeds and go outside and just throw them
and they go.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have got Mountain Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got your Cascadian Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Black Sails got his Denver Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ducks got his Caribbean Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all just throw our acclimated,
perfect seeds out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can't wait for that.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what I'm breeding.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm breeding for that world.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm always looking 10 steps ahead.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm breeding for that world,
not the world we live in right now,
[SPEAKER_18]: because this is a shit.
[SPEAKER_18]: Got to go back to the future.
[SPEAKER_18]: You need that DeLorean.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's where we're headed, Drew.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we just named all our subsequent
crosses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we got the 88 miles per hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got the Dock.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got the Marty McFly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your seed line just named itself,
bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job, Dave.
[SPEAKER_04]: Straight names are already on the
hoverboard from his lineup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks like Ross DeBob is showing us some
plants and I'm not even paying attention
[SPEAKER_04]: because I'm over here trying to pay
attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: All this other stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and then he cut out.
[SPEAKER_28]: Is that the Chava?
[SPEAKER_28]: Bob, where are you, man?
[SPEAKER_05]: Looking pretty sativa there.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was going to say, man, some skinny,
skinny leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, that's going to be a long
flower, long finisher there, but I meant
[SPEAKER_04]: the buzz is incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that stuff that gives me like the
shakes and the sweats and a panic attack.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like GMF has got to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: GMF, thank you for hanging out,
brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you in the hood next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me again, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a great night.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anytime, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you baked up something good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say if anyone's interested in 420,
I'll be making some infused kombucha and
[SPEAKER_02]: some infused low to no alcohol beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll let y'all know how those turn out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm interested.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks again, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anytime, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ciao, love.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it looks like ship is right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Bob wrote in the chat here that that's a
land race running Chamba.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's going to cross it with.
[SPEAKER_17]: Some Jamaican Jamaican land race,
Usain Bolt.
[SPEAKER_17]: He said.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he actually wrote not the bold,
Dave.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I invited this guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was rad.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe nobody else has any 420 plans.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to weasel 420 plans out of you
guys so I can find something to do and
[SPEAKER_04]: nobody's got any plans.
[SPEAKER_26]: We got the 420 neighborhood session going
on 4 p.m.
[SPEAKER_26]: Pacific Standard Time, 7 p.m.
[SPEAKER_26]: Eastern Standard Time.
[SPEAKER_26]: So, yeah, that way we could make the West
Coast 420 and the East Coast 7.
[SPEAKER_26]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_26]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_26]: So just type in the pandemic on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_26]: It's at the neighborhood grows Instagram
and that neighborhood grows YouTube.
[SPEAKER_26]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_26]: We were able to snack both of those.
[SPEAKER_26]: And, yeah, it's going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_26]: We're just going to be hanging out,
introducing ourselves, talking about what
[SPEAKER_26]: we're going to be covering over the next
foreseeable future.
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, it'll be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll also be discussing recently a lot of
states came online for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_26]: So we'll also be getting into that a
little more.
[SPEAKER_26]: Hopefully, we'll be we'll be able to talk
to people who are actually living in those
[SPEAKER_26]: areas.
[SPEAKER_26]: So, yeah, it'll definitely be an
interesting conversation.
[SPEAKER_26]: So hope to have have anyone here is
welcome to join us as well.
[SPEAKER_26]: It's just going to be us hanging out
again.
[SPEAKER_26]: And then we will be doing it on Mondays,
4 p.m.
[SPEAKER_26]: Pacific Standard Time and 7 p.m.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I look forward to learning from you,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: You definitely have a lot of stuff to
teach.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll definitely support your show
anytime.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You taught me a lot about fungus and agar
and tissue culture and all kinds of great
[SPEAKER_04]: things.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just a little bit of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been asking any questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: You feel you overflow my head or I'm like,
OK, stop Raptor.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: My brain is going to dump out any of this
shit.
[SPEAKER_26]: It's it's a lot of fun for me.
[SPEAKER_26]: That's why I've actually always been
interested in horticulture.
[SPEAKER_26]: Like unknowingly, I was brought up with in
my grandma's garden and she's man,
[SPEAKER_26]: an insane grower.
[SPEAKER_26]: She the the fruit that I would pick off
those trees are just always so delicious.
[SPEAKER_26]: It's just like, oh, the leave it alone
method, you know, benign neglect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the real growers for all the old
school people.
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_26]: Learned a lot from her and learned a lot
from just going to school and basically
[SPEAKER_26]: focusing on those things that I was
interested in working on.
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_26]: And I actually got a great start from
Cannabis Organum.
[SPEAKER_26]: I was looking more into biochemistry when
I actually started growing.
[SPEAKER_26]: So when I started growing, I did get
introduced to Cannabis Organum through
[SPEAKER_26]: embracing our organics and just started
following him.
[SPEAKER_26]: Cannabis Organum at YouTube.
[SPEAKER_26]: Great source of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_26]: I really hope to see him come back online
someday.
[SPEAKER_11]: But with all the amount of I learned so
much from you.
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_26]: Cut him down or did he disappear
voluntarily?
[SPEAKER_26]: Voluntarily.
[SPEAKER_26]: OK.
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_26]: Always a bunch of knowledge coming out of
there.
[SPEAKER_26]: I wish him much love.
[SPEAKER_26]: Just like Sabby was saying, there's so
much knowledge you can learn from him.
[SPEAKER_26]: He's the one that actually got me into
mycology.
[SPEAKER_26]: So I got to I got to hang out with him.
[SPEAKER_26]: He took me on my first foray, mushroom
foray.
[SPEAKER_26]: That's just mushroom hunting.
[SPEAKER_26]: Fancy word for mushroom hunting.
[SPEAKER_26]: And it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_26]: I got into that whole world and into
horticulture and so much so that I
[SPEAKER_26]: actually switched majors into
horticulture.
[SPEAKER_26]: So, yeah, it's he was such a big
inspiration man.
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm definitely going to hit him up,
have his number.
[SPEAKER_26]: He was really he's always been really
busy.
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, and you just hit up friends and
it's it's in the middle of like some a lot
[SPEAKER_26]: of stuff that they're going through.
[SPEAKER_26]: So, yeah, it's about time I hit him up
again.
[SPEAKER_26]: And at very least, like once everything
calms down, I am going up to the PNW.
[SPEAKER_26]: I actually plan to go up there at very
least twice, twice a year to collect
[SPEAKER_26]: mushroom, shroom, tissue samples and
spores to add to my own collection and
[SPEAKER_26]: just for my own little side projects I've
been looking into.
[SPEAKER_26]: Like DNA marking for local a lot of
species in my area, but specifically
[SPEAKER_26]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_26]: So, yeah, going to be starting up that
working with Operation Grow on some other
[SPEAKER_26]: stuff that will be connected to those
stuff.
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I gave him an invite, but it's a
little late for him.
[SPEAKER_26]: It's right in the middle of his nap time.
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_26]: But he's a he's a great source of
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm happy to be connected.
[SPEAKER_26]: To his group as well.
[SPEAKER_26]: They we do a lot.
[SPEAKER_26]: We got to interview Benocco University and
he talked a little bit about.
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_26]: And he got to tell us about polyamorous
chain reaction testing.
[SPEAKER_26]: So that's just PCR testing.
[SPEAKER_26]: And that's the whole how we're able to get
no male and female before even flower
[SPEAKER_26]: happens.
[SPEAKER_26]: That are important.
[SPEAKER_26]: Also, that goes into getting DNA markers.
[SPEAKER_26]: So that's what I'm going to be looking
into.
[SPEAKER_26]: So we'll be we'll be working on stuff like
that in the very near future.
[SPEAKER_26]: It's just a matter of saving up and doing
a little bit of organization.
[SPEAKER_26]: Who's doing what?
[SPEAKER_26]: How are we going to accomplish this?
[SPEAKER_26]: What sources are we going to use?
[SPEAKER_26]: So, yeah, it's it's going to be a lot of
fun.
[SPEAKER_26]: And hopefully we can also share all the
knowledge on the neighborhood grows.
[SPEAKER_26]: We actually.
[SPEAKER_26]: Just like Mr. Bagsy was saying,
going to be starting off with introductory
[SPEAKER_26]: grows and just starting off from step one,
you know, where where are you in your
[SPEAKER_26]: grow, especially about having.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, just like you guys are
starting with the goal.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't start with that goal and a
plan, it all turns to shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're absolutely doing it right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you guys in the future, you younger
guys, you guys make me feel like I missed
[SPEAKER_04]: a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I know how my parents feel when I talk
about the Internet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you guys talk about some growing
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, where was I when that
happened?
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are younger than me going to
school, doing all this new technology
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love what you guys are bringing to
campus at a school.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so impressive to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love staying to the roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: I keep it simple, stupid.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got an air conditioner, a light and a
dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I try not to put too many moving
parts in there because that's when it gets
[SPEAKER_04]: complicated and shit goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you guys that have all this science,
you guys blow my mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so amazing to see.
[SPEAKER_28]: You see Davis right now is actually
offering grants to local growers right
[SPEAKER_28]: here to do a lecture, all electrical
stimulus to plants, basically electrical
[SPEAKER_28]: stimulus to plants to see how they affect
the growth.
[SPEAKER_28]: And there's literally grants for right now
and the different electrical stimulus of
[SPEAKER_28]: plants and how it affects and stimulates
different functions.
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, it's really cool, man.
[SPEAKER_28]: They're doing a lot of stuff and you can
get funded for it and they'll literally
[SPEAKER_28]: pay for everything.
[SPEAKER_28]: It's pretty fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_28]: Are you in some sort of mythical
apothecary room now or is that just a
[SPEAKER_28]: basic ass kitchen?
[SPEAKER_28]: That's just basically out of a college.
[SPEAKER_28]: I've worked with a lot of growers in the
area and right now.
[SPEAKER_28]: Are you missing me trying to troll you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a real normal kitchen you're in?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is that some mystical apothecary behind
you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, this is a Japanese kitchen.
[SPEAKER_28]: Asian themed right now.
[SPEAKER_28]: Like my whole place is literally the pot I
have you set against right now is all just
[SPEAKER_28]: Asian themed kitchen and living.
[SPEAKER_28]: Everything I do here is like Asian themed.
[SPEAKER_28]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_28]: We have a giant koi garden.
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a peace garden.
[SPEAKER_28]: We have giant sand fucking lot that you
can do the rake stuff.
[SPEAKER_18]: Did this guy really say the pot that I
have you guys resting against right now?
[SPEAKER_18]: We're really in a Japanese kitchen if you
have us resting against the pot right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: His nicer little katanas.
[SPEAKER_28]: It's kind of funny because we literally
have a wachuma garden.
[SPEAKER_28]: A lot of different versions of different
breeds of cactuses going on right now.
[SPEAKER_28]: We even have some traditional stuff.
[SPEAKER_28]: Maybe some mescaline based stuff
allegedly.
[SPEAKER_28]: We have a lot of different little gardens
going on right now along the property and
[SPEAKER_28]: they're a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_28]: We take care of them.
[SPEAKER_28]: We have a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_28]: We have an outdoor section and then we
have also a few private gardens along the
[SPEAKER_28]: property as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: Are all of those Japanese themed as well?
[SPEAKER_28]: They are.
[SPEAKER_28]: There's a koi garden.
[SPEAKER_28]: There's a full fucking pond.
[SPEAKER_28]: There's a full Japanese themed center
courtyard.
[SPEAKER_28]: My question, the most important part,
do you have to take your shoes off to go
[SPEAKER_28]: in there?
[SPEAKER_28]: Fuck no, man.
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean I should but I don't know because
I'm American so I feel like it doesn't
[SPEAKER_28]: apply to me.
[SPEAKER_21]: Are you worried about forest fires with
those paper walls?
[SPEAKER_28]: Honestly, we've cut several fire roads.
[SPEAKER_28]: We've got about 40 acres up here and we've
got about six fire roads cut out.
[SPEAKER_28]: All the brush has been cleared around our
property as well as we put in large water
[SPEAKER_28]: reservoirs that the fire department can
directly tap into.
[SPEAKER_28]: So our house is kind of on the more safer
zone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there like a conch shell or maybe like
a ram horn that you blow that summons all
[SPEAKER_04]: of the ninjas?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do they just show up at a certain time
for class every day?
[SPEAKER_28]: They show up every two days.
[SPEAKER_28]: They show up every fucking two days and
they do classes and it's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_28]: They do weapons training.
[SPEAKER_28]: It's fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_28]: Like you can come down here at any time.
[SPEAKER_28]: If you guys ever want to do it live when
they're doing weapons training,
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll definitely give you guys a stoners
view of some people fighting their asses
off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to get it back on track of cannabis,
I want to know what did ninjas do for
[SPEAKER_04]: $4.20?
[SPEAKER_28]: They kick stoners asses when they come to
visit.
[SPEAKER_28]: They all get stoned as shit off our
edibles.
[SPEAKER_28]: That's what they do.
[SPEAKER_28]: We bring them edibles and they come down
here and they fight for four hours
[SPEAKER_28]: straight after we give them cookies.
[SPEAKER_28]: They get stars of death.
[SPEAKER_28]: Smok wax on, wax off.
[SPEAKER_28]: No, it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_28]: Most of the people on the property here
are, you know, they're medicated.
[SPEAKER_28]: So a lot of it happens, you know,
under medication.
[SPEAKER_28]: On a scale of one to need a nap,
how medicated are you right now?
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm not as medicated as Jeff because Jeff
be smoking like a goddamn freight train
[SPEAKER_28]: and I've seen your fucking half gram dabs
you take.
[SPEAKER_28]: So, you know, my smoking a bowl or two
here and there is like very small to you
[SPEAKER_28]: and your dab.
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, Matt, what are you doing for
$4.20, brother?
[SPEAKER_28]: Just curious, since we've got you
highlighted here, what are you doing for
[SPEAKER_28]: $4.20?
[SPEAKER_28]: I've got actually a bunch of buddies
coming up.
[SPEAKER_28]: We're having a big harvest.
[SPEAKER_28]: Actually, I planned everything to be dried
right at the time of $4.20, literally a
[SPEAKER_28]: few days before my entire room is going to
be dried and cured, ready to fucking
[SPEAKER_28]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_28]: So I invite a bunch of friends up.
[SPEAKER_28]: We got a little plot on this property
that's right up along the beach coast and
[SPEAKER_28]: literally it's this flat spot.
[SPEAKER_28]: You can see all the way to Monterey.
[SPEAKER_28]: It's the Santa Cruz beach line and we're
all camping out and we're all doing a big
[SPEAKER_28]: fucking might be allegedly doing mushrooms
and a bunch of other shit.
[SPEAKER_28]: But my whole harvest is coming down and
we're going to have fish blasting in honor
[SPEAKER_28]: of my buddy Jeff here.
[SPEAKER_28]: And so we're going to, you know,
it's going to be a good time.
[SPEAKER_28]: So $4.20 up at, you know, Santa Cruz,
if you're in the area, let me know.
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll fucking put you up on the camping
list and we'll get you guys all up on
[SPEAKER_28]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you were going to make them all
trim.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say to those ninjas,
trim weed real quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: They bust out their ninja swords.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just get the weed trimmed up and
they've all got a mask on already.
[SPEAKER_04]: So everybody's safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be so much on the bunker plan for samurai
sword.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them chops it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other one flips it over and then they
just do this a few times and it's trimmed.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: All the fucking done.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's too good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt, I'm glad you made it, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a long time since we've got to
hang out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this was fucking fun to get you in here
from SoCal, MidCal, not even SoCal,
[SPEAKER_28]: MidCal.
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, right on the coast, man,
right between Monterey and Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_28]: San Jose and Santa Cruz, man, right in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right near that beach.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right near the beach.
[SPEAKER_28]: The real ocean grown.
[SPEAKER_28]: The ocean grown, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_28]: No, I don't know what that means.
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, we get too much goddamn humidity.
[SPEAKER_28]: That's what it means.
[SPEAKER_28]: So don't feel bad.
[SPEAKER_28]: That's what it means.
[SPEAKER_28]: Ocean grown means you get too much goddamn
fucking fog off the bay.
[SPEAKER_28]: I was gifted.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to go too deep into this,
but I was gifted some California spider
[SPEAKER_04]: mites.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bro, those Mendo mites are the most
voracious fucking mites that I have ever
[SPEAKER_04]: dealt with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to the Mendo mites.
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't come from your neck of the
woods.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I know exactly who gave them to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't go down that path too far.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to have to edit you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those mites were crazy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those Cali mites were the worst.
[SPEAKER_04]: Never had mites like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what killed them?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what got rid of them?
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado mites.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado cold.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what did it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just get it super cold from the Colorado
cold.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were like, I don't know what to
do with this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they stopped.
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, I ruined that fuckfest for sure.
[SPEAKER_28]: That's why it's so important you hit them
during veg.
[SPEAKER_28]: That's why I tell everybody, if you get
cuts from people you don't know,
[SPEAKER_28]: or you don't fucking have, or if you
aren't sure about their shit, fucking
[SPEAKER_28]: quarantine them shits off.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did all of the protocol.
[SPEAKER_04]: But those mites were, they were just like,
yeah, you thought we were gone?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they just all ran out at one time and
they all gave me the finger.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm flipping you off so hard right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they just ran away.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I tried to hit them with pesticides.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just laughed at me, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were.
[SPEAKER_21]: Did you dip the clones in soft oil X?
[SPEAKER_21]: It seems to be about the only thing that
works for getting rid of mites for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have that because it just feels
like it's more, more harsh than I'm ready
[SPEAKER_04]: for, but I'll try it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably like a canola, some sort of
a white oil with a wetting agent or
[SPEAKER_04]: something in there.
[SPEAKER_21]: I may do that, but a dip is a good idea.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I dip all my clones.
[SPEAKER_21]: If it's coming in from off property,
it gets dipped.
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't care if I have to take a rooted
clone and reroute it.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not worth the biosecurity of me
risking the facility.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It did slow me down quite a bit,
to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It definitely, that and another thing that
I adjusted, another learning curve got me.
[SPEAKER_28]: It's really cramping your style,
I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_28]: Just be sure to tell people that didn't
come from my goddamn garden.
[SPEAKER_28]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're ninja mites, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's already obvious where they came from.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're ninja mites.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ninja themed skills.
[SPEAKER_26]: You're the one that feels the insecurity
about it, buddy.
[SPEAKER_26]: Like Mike's comment earlier, hash
assassins.
[SPEAKER_17]: I used a product back in the day that I'll
never use again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember when we were new and you'd go to
the grow store and you'd be like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I have mice.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'd go, here, go spray this all over
your crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd be like, and then you'd get like a
wig blister on your arm.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd be like, I wonder what that's from.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could have been the pesticides,
but I had these plants with this product
[SPEAKER_04]: one time.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to talk about what it was
because fuck me for doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know better now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I shame on you.
[SPEAKER_04]: On me forever using that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck the guy at the grow store is what we
got to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I use this product and I came in the
next day and the spider mites were dead,
[SPEAKER_04]: but there were repelling from the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like they were like, what do we
do?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm out of here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they just threw a fucking web and
repelled from the leaves like cliffhanger.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they just died swinging there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a bunch of mites swinging in the
fucking fan, dead as shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it was, it was a neat thing to see,
but oh my God, I'll never use that product
[SPEAKER_04]: again.
[SPEAKER_04]: I should not have done that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know any better.
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize, but I'm honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just swinging.
[SPEAKER_21]: What was that organic certified?
[SPEAKER_21]: There was an organic certified,
um, might spray that everyone was using in
[SPEAKER_21]: Colorado for a while there.
[SPEAKER_21]: And like everyone had to trash their
grows.
[SPEAKER_21]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Eagle 21.
[SPEAKER_04]: These guys lied and said that the product
was organic, but there was other stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: hidden in the product that they weren't
claiming.
[SPEAKER_04]: So people were failing pesticide tests.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I went on a podcast episode and I
talked about it and then I said,
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, if this is your company, you've got
an open invite to be on my show whenever
[SPEAKER_04]: you'd like.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can come explain this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they never did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'm sure they heard it because
somebody had the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: I try to stay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so busy doing a podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't worry about fucking possibly
stuff.
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't have time, bro.
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, I know half of Colorado dunks in the
Eagle 21.
[SPEAKER_28]: So that's why I mentioned that one.
[SPEAKER_28]: That was the number one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eagle 20 is banned in every commercial
fucking facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that shit's gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it burns off.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the cyanide gas or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, can't have that around.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you need that, you went too hard on
something anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I had dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, no, I'm with you, man.
[SPEAKER_28]: I just watch facilities do, man.
[SPEAKER_28]: It's not, I can, I don't condone it at
all.
[SPEAKER_28]: It's just one of those things where it's
like, Oh fuck, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they've got technology.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, they come in and they swab the walls
and they can tell you what pesticides have
[SPEAKER_04]: been used for like the past two or three
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they detect an illegal pesticide in
there from years ago, years ago,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, if anybody gets that one, that's
funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, but years ago, if they get your
pesticides, uh, from years ago,
[SPEAKER_04]: they'll shut you down and kill the crop
that you've got.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's all lost.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to kill everything and start
fresh.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, you gotta be careful with what
they sprayed in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: The previous owners could have sprayed
something and I bought that facility and
[SPEAKER_04]: now they come in and they test it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, no, we found a bit of
cloperate in the wall.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're like, Oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like document when you found that so that
we can kill everything before that start
[SPEAKER_04]: fresh.
[SPEAKER_28]: I found some super differences being in
Colorado and California as far as like the
[SPEAKER_28]: dispensary goes experienced, uh,
here, they don't give you three stickers.
[SPEAKER_28]: They don't check your ID three times.
[SPEAKER_28]: It almost feels illegal.
[SPEAKER_28]: The way they do it here.
[SPEAKER_28]: You fucking walk into a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_28]: They just take your fucking money and hand
you weed.
[SPEAKER_28]: They don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_28]: They don't give you this.
[SPEAKER_28]: They're like, you want to receive?
[SPEAKER_28]: You're like, no, I don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_28]: It's not like Colorado.
[SPEAKER_28]: They don't sticker that shit up.
[SPEAKER_28]: They're not three buckets.
[SPEAKER_28]: There's no plastic shit.
[SPEAKER_28]: They just hand you a fucking bag of weed.
[SPEAKER_28]: And they're just like, here you go,
man, 40 bucks.
[SPEAKER_28]: You're like, wow, this is great.
[SPEAKER_28]: It's weird though, because coming from
Colorado, literally they'll check your ID
[SPEAKER_28]: three fucking times, literally,
you know, at each fucking stop of it and
[SPEAKER_28]: make sure you're the same person you were
10 seconds ago and like stick your shit.
[SPEAKER_28]: And I, I almost respect that more because
it is so thorough in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_28]: Like it was so thorough there.
[SPEAKER_28]: And then I got here and it was just like,
basically it was like how much bag you
[SPEAKER_28]: want, bro.
[SPEAKER_28]: And I'm just like, Oh fucking hell.
[SPEAKER_28]: I guess that one fucking, Hey,
just do you want a receipt?
[SPEAKER_28]: Nah, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_28]: Straight.
[SPEAKER_28]: You can go on now.
[SPEAKER_28]: I was like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_17]: They shut up and take my money kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_28]: You just fucking hand us money.
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll hand you weed, dude.
[SPEAKER_28]: You just get the fuck out of here now.
[SPEAKER_28]: And it's weird because coming from
Colorado where they try to like,
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, they're going to give you four
stickers to tell you that this will cause
[SPEAKER_28]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_28]: If you're pregnant, please do not smoke
this.
[SPEAKER_28]: Or if you're, you know, this can may cause
all this shit and those sticker at three
[SPEAKER_28]: or four times before you can leave the
place.
[SPEAKER_28]: And then they'll staple your bag with a
receipt on the outside and they'll hand it
[SPEAKER_28]: to you and you're like, then you walk out
the door after you've been ID three times
[SPEAKER_28]: here, you, you hand them ID at the door
and they're just like, Oh, you're 21.
[SPEAKER_28]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_28]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_28]: Go in.
[SPEAKER_28]: How much do you want?
[SPEAKER_17]: The full situation.
[SPEAKER_17]: The full situation to describe is when it
becomes drugs.
[SPEAKER_28]: They literally felt way more black market
than I've ever felt in my life.
[SPEAKER_28]: I walked in, I felt like I was talking to
a straight stoner sitting on his couch,
[SPEAKER_28]: fucking smoking weed with me, dude.
[SPEAKER_28]: He was just like, here you go,
fucking 40 bucks dog.
[SPEAKER_28]: And I was just like straight up sweet.
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm gonna go home now.
[SPEAKER_28]: Beat me at street fighter.
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll give you a half a gram extra.
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_28]: If I can beat you at fucking Mario Kurt,
how much I get off 10%.
[SPEAKER_15]: What's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: The part I don't miss about buying weed
sitting on some dude's fucking couch,
[SPEAKER_04]: watching him fucking finish around a
fucking final fantasy seven before I can
[SPEAKER_04]: get an eighth from him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like bro, just press pause and give me a
bag of weed.
[SPEAKER_18]: We'd play Madden for the bag.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll bet you the bag.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll bet you the bag.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll beat you at Madden.
[SPEAKER_18]: If I lose, I'll pay you back.
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you remember blitz?
[SPEAKER_28]: I had blitz with my shit.
[SPEAKER_28]: Does anybody play blitz back in the day?
[SPEAKER_28]: That was the football game of choice right
there.
[SPEAKER_28]: Cause you got superpowers.
[SPEAKER_28]: You could like fucking blow through people
and shit.
[SPEAKER_28]: That shit was for people who couldn't play
Madden.
[SPEAKER_21]: That was Cal P and Counterstrike and used
to work at a cyber cafe.
[SPEAKER_21]: I played real pro games.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_21]: Add sweats.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what anybody said.
[SPEAKER_04]: You all sounded like Charlie Brown's
teacher all at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just saying something stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I score on Gallagher.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just told everybody how old you are
too.
[SPEAKER_17]: Have a good one bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheers to everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't feel bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for being here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to New York.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy 420 everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to New York.
[SPEAKER_13]: The mighty wrench.
[SPEAKER_21]: Earlier you were asking about what people
do for 420.
[SPEAKER_21]: 420 is kind of six months roughly away
from Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_21]: Does anybody else get together with their
friends and kind of have like a
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanksgiving stone or Thanksgiving?
[SPEAKER_21]: It's something that I kind of started
after.
[SPEAKER_21]: We used to do a 420 party back in
Philadelphia and we were always super
[SPEAKER_21]: hungry afterwards.
[SPEAKER_21]: So one year I just got the idea.
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, I'm going to cook a turkey and we
kind of turned into this huge potluck that
[SPEAKER_21]: we had each year.
[SPEAKER_21]: Does anybody else kind of do a friends
gathering kind of thing like that?
[SPEAKER_28]: No, but now that I'm doing this camping
trip, I may start doing that fucking hell.
[SPEAKER_18]: That sounds good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotta get stoned or eat a bunch of fucking
rice.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be miserable.
[SPEAKER_18]: I kind of went the other way.
[SPEAKER_18]: I kind of
[SPEAKER_18]: went the other way.
[SPEAKER_18]: I take my flowers and I do what I want to
do.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's usually me and my dog and we go
getting lost in the woods or we go find a
[SPEAKER_18]: lake or we go.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just usually for me, because the rest
of my life is so everybody everybody
[SPEAKER_18]: everybody that's I take that day for me.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I kind of went the other way.
[SPEAKER_18]: I can totally see why you would go do
friends living friends giving and stuff.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's beautiful, but I went the other way
personally.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's that's really great.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cascadian.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm hoping that the next day or two in the
forest.
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, John 420.
[SPEAKER_26]: This is like right at his side field and
shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: A bag of mushrooms in his hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pupils just big as fuck and big old smile
on his face.
[SPEAKER_26]: That's the way to do it, man.
[SPEAKER_26]: I had a lot of fun in the woods on my
trip, so you enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_26]: You deserve it.
[SPEAKER_26]: You work hard.
[SPEAKER_26]: Alone time is always good for him.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to get Ross to Bob on the show
when his connections a little better.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll just be Bob and I and we're going to
talk a little bit more about another 420
[SPEAKER_04]: aspect.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of us aren't even probably aware of
only a couple of people in this room
[SPEAKER_04]: probably even understand what I'm hinting
at.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'll be a cool lesson for a lot of
people and we can get Bob on with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: High grade Jamaican Internet connection
will be just him and I so we can edit
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff out a little easier, but we'll get
you going Bob.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big respect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for being available and able to
do that for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whenever you're ready, Ross, whenever
you're ready.
[SPEAKER_26]: That's how good the ganja is over there.
[SPEAKER_26]: The smoke, you know, really interferes
with all that connection.
[SPEAKER_26]: It's yeah, that chalice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw something online.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw something online that made me feel
weird inside when I read it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody had a plant outside and it was
going to go into flower and they said,
[SPEAKER_04]: how do I stop this from going into flower?
[SPEAKER_04]: We recommended put a little LED light over
it, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That way it doesn't go into flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: They asked.
[SPEAKER_04]: They seriously asked, will the wind
outside blow the light away from the
[SPEAKER_04]: flower?
[SPEAKER_04]: Keith is cracking up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've seen this too as a light guy.
[SPEAKER_20]: You shared it with us.
[SPEAKER_20]: The guy drew a fucking picture with light
beams coming down, wind light coming
[SPEAKER_20]: through and hitting them.
[SPEAKER_26]: If you look at this diagram, I've clearly
depicted what's going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want better efficiency in your grow
for your lights, just put a fan up top and
[SPEAKER_04]: just blow the light around.
[SPEAKER_11]: I always wondered.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was wondering this the whole time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't you guys understand that that light
is photons?
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_18]: I want two of whatever he's smoking.
[SPEAKER_18]: Why the guys would have the fans blowing
on their plants like that.
[SPEAKER_18]: Cause you always see the plants like
shaking in the wind.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm like, that's not healthy, right?
[SPEAKER_18]: But they got to blow the light onto the
plant.
[SPEAKER_18]: Then that man, it's just mind blowing,
dude.
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_18]: I just started talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you started talking, I assumed they
meant like blowing the light itself away,
[SPEAKER_03]: like the unit, not the light that's being
generated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, Oh, I guess, I guess if it's a
lightweight, the wind, cause what if it's
[SPEAKER_03]: hanging?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, no, is that what for the
sake of humanity?
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish that's what they were asking,
but this person truly thought that the
[SPEAKER_04]: lumens or the whatever's the jewels,
the photons were going to get blown away.
[SPEAKER_04]: What part of this person from,
Hey, I'm not going which part of wherever
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not even going to say a place,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: We need to protect this person.
[SPEAKER_18]: They, they're a jewel to society.
[SPEAKER_18]: We, we, we very rarely come up.
[SPEAKER_18]: It could be a great news.
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt, I already got to hit you twice.
[SPEAKER_19]: Now search was exhausted.
[SPEAKER_04]: We found the crystals, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you guys, when you put your lights
outside, put up a windscreen to prevent
[SPEAKER_04]: the lumens from being stolen by,
by the land.
[SPEAKER_21]: So, you know, the whole like single photon
slit experiment where you get like
[SPEAKER_21]: different scatter patterns.
[SPEAKER_21]: I always wondered if you took like a grid
pattern that was like really microscopic
[SPEAKER_21]: and put it as like a, a filter on your
light.
[SPEAKER_21]: If you could get a bigger scatter pattern
with the photons.
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyways, just on like a total nerd thing.
[SPEAKER_21]: I wish I understood that enough that to
understand any of that experiment.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: Like a micro light diffuser.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the, that's the concept of a light
diffuser in a, in like a commercial
[SPEAKER_18]: setting.
[SPEAKER_18]: They have the lights warehouse.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just talking about between the light
and the actual thing.
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyways, it's totally just like stupid
proof of like a magnifying glass will
[SPEAKER_04]: burn.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll help make the light more intense to
burn my leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why can't we put a special shape lens on
there to give us, I see where you're
[SPEAKER_04]: going, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something, the same idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a bunch of magnifying glasses that
are just enough to make it better,
[SPEAKER_01]: but not enough to burn any lens that you
put on top of the led actually is a
[SPEAKER_01]: decrease in efficiency, whether you use a
90 degree lens or any other sort of lenses
[SPEAKER_01]: that you see that the aftermarket,
a lot of companies use, but they all,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, they equal inefficiency in the
transmission of PPFD to the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, the best way is to have nothing
between the led and your plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Turn down the damn leds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause my plants didn't like a hundred
percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was amazed.
[SPEAKER_04]: They wanted like a closer to 50% to
introduce them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had to adjust for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: My plants were kind of mad at me.
[SPEAKER_28]: I got a Phantom led right now.
[SPEAKER_28]: I had to run it at 60% because anything
over that started yellow leaves and
[SPEAKER_28]: started getting the color tips up.
[SPEAKER_28]: And I was like, ah, you fucking bitches.
[SPEAKER_28]: And even if you pulled them off,
what you thought with an HBS would work at
[SPEAKER_28]: about 60%, it would work very well,
but any more than 60%, it was just fucking
[SPEAKER_28]: curling up leaves and make him not happy.
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_28]: They were, it was just like, Hey,
that's too much light.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go yellow fast, but I've
learned and that's, and I, I'm,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm fucking excited about learning.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, Oh, they're going yellow.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do I do?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I always know what to do in the grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I walked in and I was like,
Oh, this is kind of exciting to see if I
[SPEAKER_04]: can fix them and bring them out of this
crap.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I haven't had to do that in a
while since I worked at this one
[SPEAKER_04]: commercial girl where I felt like a couple
of guys were just purposely trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: throw wrenches in the works every day to
walk in and find out what they did.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_20]: I kind of wonder like what you guys do
with HID lights that you can't just like
[SPEAKER_20]: raise and dim.
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, because like if you, um, are giving a
plant, you know, 18 hours of light in veg,
[SPEAKER_20]: and then you cut it down, you know,
33% to 12 hours for flour.
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, you know, that's 33% less light every
day.
[SPEAKER_20]: So like to give them the same intensity in
veg and flour light is definitely not
[SPEAKER_20]: optimal.
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, generally you'd run a much lower
wattage or you wouldn't run HIDs in veg.
[SPEAKER_28]: Anyway, you would probably switch to HIDs
once you hit flour.
[SPEAKER_28]: Uh, for the most part, you know,
315s, uh, CMAH are kind of the popular veg
[SPEAKER_28]: light right now, but running HIDs in
general, like you would not want to just
[SPEAKER_28]: run like straight up HIDs and then try to
go into flour from there.
[SPEAKER_28]: But the 12-12 photo period, that's how
plants work.
[SPEAKER_28]: And they're naturally going to want to
work on that photo period of 12-12.
[SPEAKER_28]: So when you reduce that light,
it's just changing how they hermit,
[SPEAKER_28]: uh, the hormones that are in the plant to,
to switch into flour.
[SPEAKER_28]: It's not a matter of reducing how much
light is getting in, uh, photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_28]: It needs that.
[SPEAKER_28]: To switch into that photo period.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would, I would say when you veg with
HID, it's really easy to use the lux meter
[SPEAKER_03]: and use numbers and yeah, in veg alone,
but it is getting less light, but in for
[SPEAKER_03]: you, it's, it's a lot higher of a light
intensity than it is in veg.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, I had a learning curve where it
was like clearly getting too much light,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you know, it was like, I thought it
was pretty high up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have, I had them on full blast cause
it's just kind of what you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put it on a level, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, so it's just like, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I had the same learning curve and,
um, it's getting less light time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting more than double light.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to kill your camera brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you're kind of cutting out,
but we'll keep your audio going.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to stop your video for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotcha.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They sound much better now.
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_26]: Much better.
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, you're saying sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but so it gets less light in flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: It also gets about double a little more
than double the intensity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I would go from about 20 lux to 60
lux.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,
[SPEAKER_03]: so it is getting more light energy in
flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, even with the reduced time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, he's cutting out a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to interrupt him a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I've noticed that I can definitely
reduce the amount of hours I run my lights
[SPEAKER_04]: with the LEDs compared to when I was
running the HPS is I used to run 20 on and
[SPEAKER_04]: five off because I keep mother plants for
breeding and I love them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to keep them growing, but
definitely not going into flower and I
[SPEAKER_04]: want them producing a lot of clones for
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I was able to put the bedroom down to
18 six and I don't see any plants trying
[SPEAKER_04]: to flower early.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and I noticed they start drooping
later in the day, which tells me they've
[SPEAKER_04]: gotten enough light.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're tired.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're sleepy.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're ready to take a nap.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, so yeah, I'm definitely running less
light hours and I've got the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that they went, that that knob
went a hundred percent to zero percent,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's like, uh, it's different.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I even turned them down further than I
thought I had them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got them less than 50% right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've done maybe too close together,
but my plants are loving it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that I kind of figured it out,
uh, I get the less hours, less intensity.
[SPEAKER_04]: It feels like if you're giving them the
right light, they don't need nearly as
[SPEAKER_04]: much of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're just, they're beasting out.
[SPEAKER_28]: And I think environment plays a lot in
that light.
[SPEAKER_28]: Uh, you know, there's guys who run 11 13,
I think even dirt man, Dan before did an,
[SPEAKER_28]: uh, uh, episode of embracing organics
where they were talking about doing 11 13
[SPEAKER_28]: is versus the 12 12, just to reduce,
you know, the overall monthly light bill,
[SPEAKER_28]: but you can still achieve some of the same
goals maybe with a higher T D ratio,
[SPEAKER_28]: uh, giving them more dark to light,
um, but just also reducing, you know,
[SPEAKER_28]: one hour a day, uh, and light cycle.
[SPEAKER_28]: So there's definitely room to play with
these photo period plants.
[SPEAKER_28]: And I think if, uh, you know, I don't know
if you're, if you're worried about like
[SPEAKER_28]: some of the, uh, differences between the
switching in transition, you know,
[SPEAKER_28]: that's part of why, like there is that
transition period where they say,
[SPEAKER_28]: you know, like, uh, you know, going from
flower to, you know, going from bench to
[SPEAKER_28]: flower, you probably got to, you know,
a couple of days before they start to
[SPEAKER_28]: really take that photo period,
you know, before they start to show that
[SPEAKER_28]: they're starting those signs, you'll even
notice that they, they have that bench
[SPEAKER_28]: cycle down.
[SPEAKER_28]: Even if you're running in 18 six,
they'll still assume that for the first
[SPEAKER_28]: three to five days, even in your flowers,
like when you first switch them,
[SPEAKER_28]: it's just how photo period work and,
uh, reducing them to that isn't going to
[SPEAKER_28]: affect them so much.
[SPEAKER_28]: If you're still maintaining the same kind
of intensity, or if you're running to HID
[SPEAKER_28]: from T fives, that's just how we've always
ran.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing I've noticed for sure is that
the batch of seeds I made under led lights
[SPEAKER_04]: have the best germination rate of any
seeds I've ever made.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's something I can for sure
say these seeds are like, ah, these packs
[SPEAKER_04]: are sealed or I've dumped them out and
show you a little bit vacuum sealed these
[SPEAKER_04]: packs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So can't show you, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you get them and you're mad that
they're sealed, don't complain.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're sealed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they're tamper free.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a couple of people be like,
bro, I tried for an hour to get that open.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not my fault.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need a helmet and Velcro shoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a fucking heat seal.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get it open.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_28]: I really, I'd love to hear Steve's view
on, you know, light cycles and stuff,
[SPEAKER_28]: because, you know, he bases a lot of his
stuff, especially greenhouse work and
[SPEAKER_28]: stuff like that based on the season cycles
of light cycles of the region.
[SPEAKER_28]: So I'd definitely like to hear,
you know, maybe how he bases a lot more of
[SPEAKER_28]: when he starts seasons and, you know,
based on his area of, you know,
[SPEAKER_28]: where he thinks, uh, you know,
different parts of the year are better for
[SPEAKER_28]: certain areas.
[SPEAKER_28]: I would love to hear kind of some of the
light seasons that he's experienced.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, if I'm going to transition something
outdoors, I try to get it within an hour
[SPEAKER_21]: of what it's going to transition into.
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, generally they, they won't pout too
much within about an hour, hour and a half
[SPEAKER_21]: difference.
[SPEAKER_21]: When you get past that, they really start
pouting and you might have a bit of a slow
[SPEAKER_21]: down period where it kind of was curious
if it wants to go to flower and it'll go
[SPEAKER_21]: back to veg most of the time.
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, or, you know, just hang a couple of
obnoxious of, you know, like you go to the
[SPEAKER_21]: Walmart or Lowe's or any of these other
box stores after Christmas, they always
[SPEAKER_21]: have those like regular LEDs and then the
obnoxiously bright white one, right?
[SPEAKER_21]: Those obnoxiously bright white ones are
great for just throwing over your plants
[SPEAKER_21]: for two hours just to give them that extra
day, you know, on your outdoor.
[SPEAKER_21]: There's, I mean, they're still useful for
something and you can get them on
[SPEAKER_21]: clearance, you know, after Christmas and
oftentimes this time of year they're,
[SPEAKER_21]: they're discounted because they're not,
they're not moving.
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's definitely something else that,
you know, I like to do now.
[SPEAKER_21]: I will say too on the other direction that
I've seen quite a bit of different
[SPEAKER_21]: cultivars, particularly in the CBD
cultivars throw, um, male flowers,
[SPEAKER_21]: if they're kept under 24 hours of,
of daylight, um, even in veg, um,
[SPEAKER_21]: uh, well, they'd be beautiful,
beautiful looking female flowers,
[SPEAKER_21]: but in each node, there's one to four
little tiny flowers that are, you know,
[SPEAKER_21]: occasionally throwing pollen.
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, if I dropped those same, same exact
plants down to 18, six, uh, they stopped
[SPEAKER_21]: doing that.
[SPEAKER_21]: Now the only difference that I've changed
on those and that particular grow was the
[SPEAKER_21]: lights.
[SPEAKER_21]: Nothing else changed.
[SPEAKER_21]: No nutrients, no temperature, no,
that was the only thing.
[SPEAKER_21]: And it was the Jamaican lion lions and
the, the AC DC lines were the two that,
[SPEAKER_21]: that we're showing that particular
expression.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I just attributed it to being
something to do with CBD because CBD in
[SPEAKER_21]: particular is fairly pigeonhole genetic.
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, pretty much too.
[SPEAKER_28]: There's only a few places in the world
where there's 24 hour light, you know,
[SPEAKER_28]: you have the Ruralis in Russia and you
have Alaska there in places where it does
[SPEAKER_28]: the 24 hour situation.
[SPEAKER_28]: I imagine a lot of the photo period plants
are not prepared honestly for that kind of
[SPEAKER_28]: way.
[SPEAKER_28]: So it makes sense that that would be the
case.
[SPEAKER_21]: I think plants are just like humans.
[SPEAKER_21]: If you keep us awake for 24 hours for a
long period of time, we go crazy.
[SPEAKER_21]: Plants do that too.
[SPEAKER_21]: They have hormones that have to be
produced at nighttime.
[SPEAKER_21]: And if they don't have a sleep cycle,
it chemically has a hard time producing
[SPEAKER_21]: certain compounds.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm sure it would negatively impact
the system of the plants as well.
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, that would probably be the first
thing to suffer.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're thinking about putting them
outside and trying to match the,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, the daylight hours of outside,
sorry, my brain could think the word
[SPEAKER_04]: daylight hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're trying to match those daylight
hours, are you thinking about the,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, the far red light that the sun's
putting off as it goes down?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you compensating for any of that?
[SPEAKER_21]: I've never worried about that.
[SPEAKER_21]: The only time I've ever tried to worry
about that is trying to make them go to
[SPEAKER_21]: sleep faster.
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, the, the phytochrome, uh, you know,
when you, with the far red triggers that
[SPEAKER_21]: phytochrome in the leaves and it helps put
the plant to sleep.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I've seen quite a bit of data that
shows that, you know, it does make a
[SPEAKER_21]: pretty significant difference.
[SPEAKER_21]: You can even eke out, you know,
an extra half hour, an hour with your
[SPEAKER_21]: lights on.
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, if you're really trying to push
numbers and still have that same sleep
[SPEAKER_21]: period as far as, you know, that hormone,
hormone buildup to actually make the
[SPEAKER_21]: plants believe, you know, have that full
sleep cycle.
[SPEAKER_21]: Definitely something that you can play
with a little bit, but I haven't done
[SPEAKER_21]: anything on the outdoor.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll be honest with you on all the bigger
stuff that I've done the last three years,
[SPEAKER_21]: including Africa.
[SPEAKER_21]: We had a greenhouse facility that was
basically the nursery that cranked out all
[SPEAKER_21]: the production plants.
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, and we did a couple of testers in
there and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe had a, you know, two or three
flowering rooms and then everything else
[SPEAKER_21]: was just mass produced for the fields.
[SPEAKER_21]: Right?
[SPEAKER_21]: So once we figured out that which
cultivars were going to give us really
[SPEAKER_21]: good production, we were cloning that out.
[SPEAKER_21]: And again, the consistency of production
that you get from clones still beats the
[SPEAKER_21]: living daylights out of seed.
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, um, uh, you know, you need,
you need to tell that if you're really
[SPEAKER_21]: going to have now, I do think that,
you know, in another few years,
[SPEAKER_21]: they'll get the genetic stabilized,
but, um, certainly not with autos,
[SPEAKER_21]: definitely with, and, you know,
less or so with, uh, with photos is
[SPEAKER_21]: they're just not stable enough to have
mass seed batches that are that,
[SPEAKER_21]: you know, over 10,000 or 50 or a hundred
thousand seeds that are, you know,
[SPEAKER_21]: that predictable of a chemo, a chemo of
our stability.
[SPEAKER_21]: It just doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_21]: And, and who knows if we'll ever be able
to achieve that.
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, just look at apple trees.
[SPEAKER_21]: They've never achieved that genetically
ever to be able to have, I mean,
[SPEAKER_21]: if you take an apple, uh, an apple tree,
every single seed off that apple tree is a
[SPEAKER_21]: different phenome.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's why Johnny Appleseed was able to
have so many different strains named after
[SPEAKER_21]: him and attributed him is because he
planted more phenomes than anyone else
[SPEAKER_21]: did.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll let you bring brother.
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a better chance of doing it with
cannabis than we do with Appleseed though.
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: Way, way better chance for sure.
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't mean to say we can't, I'm just
saying that much shorter, quite a few
[SPEAKER_21]: years off.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate to interrupt you gentlemen,
but, uh, we had another lady join the
[SPEAKER_04]: group.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to take a moment to welcome the
lady.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Cass popped in.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to give her a minute to tell us
where she's from.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause that has been the custom cast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are you joining us from tonight?
[SPEAKER_24]: Cheers from Texas.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of felt that coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'm not sure if you want people
stalking you on social media, but I
[SPEAKER_04]: usually give people a chance to tell us,
uh, their social media, uh, tell them how
[SPEAKER_04]: they could find you or your business.
[SPEAKER_04]: Online if you want to, or you could tell
me to not do that.
[SPEAKER_28]: If you were, I will say Steve,
uh, one thing that I heard from a botanist
[SPEAKER_28]: is kind of scary.
[SPEAKER_04]: She got interrupted and went silent.
[SPEAKER_28]: Sorry, Cass.
[SPEAKER_04]: They talked right over your inner,
your intro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Follow Cass you guys, if you know how to
follow Cass follower, go ahead,
[SPEAKER_28]: bro.
[SPEAKER_28]: What were you saying?
[SPEAKER_28]: I would say one thing that I've heard from
a botanist is that, uh, they would like to
[SPEAKER_28]: Unicrop cannabis in the same way that they
have done tomatoes and potatoes in our,
[SPEAKER_28]: uh, in our in our grocery stores to where
it's very much the same crop that they
[SPEAKER_28]: produce mass massively on tissue culture
levels to where it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_28]: one, you know, specific thing.
[SPEAKER_28]: And I've, I've heard botanists talk about,
you know, trying to stabilize out cannabis
[SPEAKER_28]: into the way to where they can do that as
well, which I don't think they'll be able
[SPEAKER_28]: to do because cannabis lovers also love
variety.
[SPEAKER_28]: But, uh, it is one of the things that if
they were to go to federal that they've
[SPEAKER_28]: talked about a lot of botanists are very
big on the Unicropping idea of,
[SPEAKER_28]: you know, monetizing and just trying to
make one crop that you can reproduce
[SPEAKER_28]: nonstop.
[SPEAKER_28]: That's just, you know, commercially viable
and it's going to be a heavy.
[SPEAKER_28]: No way, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get tired of that so quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I go to the dispensary and I never buy the
same thing two times in a row,
[SPEAKER_04]: unless it's something I bred and they got
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But every time I go, I get different
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_28]: But how many times do you ask for a
different tomato at the grocery store,
doc?
[SPEAKER_04]: How many times do you ask for different
tomatoes?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's a different, different ball
game, but I got Romas.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got cherries.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got, uh, those purple hearts,
but yeah, no, I think there's always,
[SPEAKER_04]: and if that does happen, you're always
going to be growing fucking something you
[SPEAKER_04]: bred and I'm going to be growing something
I bred.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, Steve's grown something he bred
and hopefully painted ladies growing
[SPEAKER_04]: something I bred.
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_28]: I've just, I've heard rumors from several
botanists and several people on the
[SPEAKER_28]: multimillion dollar kind of commercial
facilities who are trying to sell hardcore
[SPEAKER_28]: model crops so they can just get these
consistent shit.
[SPEAKER_28]: That's just all the same.
[SPEAKER_28]: And it's just kind of horrifying to think
because we all love so much variety as
[SPEAKER_28]: cannabis consumers.
[SPEAKER_21]: The gentleman that brought you quote
unquote outrageous new strains was
[SPEAKER_21]: summarily fired two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_18]: Through their credit, just because they
want to monocrop something doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_18]: it's going to suck.
[SPEAKER_18]: And it doesn't mean they won't monocropped
enough varieties to fill a Walmart.
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, I'm not, uh, I'm not for that game.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just playing devil's advocate.
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, if they have got, they've got the
resources to line breed one into homogeny,
[SPEAKER_18]: they can do that again.
[SPEAKER_18]: So if they can offer you one that they can
grow by the acre, watch out because in
[SPEAKER_18]: five years they'll offer you 10.
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, well that's what they do right now
in Idaho with the potato crops.
[SPEAKER_28]: I literally, my family has several potato
farms up there and right now Lays and
[SPEAKER_28]: fucking Pringles have their own potato
that they tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_28]: And every time they produce the same
potato, they only have the same potato
[SPEAKER_28]: that they monocropped for those companies
because they're specifically bred to be
[SPEAKER_28]: what that company wants.
[SPEAKER_28]: It's the certain shape that works well on
their machines.
[SPEAKER_28]: It's the certain shape that cuts to the
right point.
[SPEAKER_28]: Uh, you know, certain ones want elongated
potatoes, potatoes, certain ones want
[SPEAKER_28]: rounded potatoes, depending on the
company.
[SPEAKER_28]: They'll monocrop it out and tissue culture
to the end of existence.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to cut up tomatoes or
potatoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's wrong with my brain injury?
[SPEAKER_04]: I did that the other day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Talking about the potato podcast again,
we got, we got to cut them to see.
[SPEAKER_17]: All about steak was lining up to say
something to snow.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no rapper talking about fucking
Idaho's and Russets.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like nobody's got no rappers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as soon as a rapper starts rapping
about potatoes and it'll change,
[SPEAKER_04]: but everybody wants different weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like everybody's going to always want
different weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a breeder and I know that the monocrop
idea will work a little bit in a big old
[SPEAKER_04]: commercial.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those guys, this facility monocropping the
shit out, but, uh, nobody buys one pack of
[SPEAKER_04]: the one pack of seeds from me.
[SPEAKER_04]: They always get two packs and they always
get like multiple different kinds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't see too many of the,
the home growers in the basement
[SPEAKER_04]: Buccaneers doing that.
[SPEAKER_18]: Not the, not the home growers,
but when you got somebody that wants to
[SPEAKER_18]: launch now, you've got to open your mind a
little bit, look into the future a little
[SPEAKER_18]: bit.
[SPEAKER_18]: But when you've got somebody that wants to
launch an international product and they
[SPEAKER_18]: need to reproduceable cannabinoids,
they need a stabilized line that can grow
[SPEAKER_18]: the same year to year to year to keep
their product as consistent as you expect
[SPEAKER_18]: your cognac to be.
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, it's a, it's a different ball game.
[SPEAKER_18]: You'll always have the people that are
making the, you'll always have the,
[SPEAKER_18]: the exotic mics of the world, but you're
going to have some of us have to grow
[SPEAKER_24]: mids.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_24]: Some of us,
[SPEAKER_24]: if we grow mids, we're going to grow a lot
of it.
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.
[SPEAKER_24]: Right now people only know two red
cigarette or green cigarette.
[SPEAKER_24]: It's only two types to have mental or some
red type.
[SPEAKER_24]: So once you have it a lot in the mind,
it will be offered in the future.
[SPEAKER_24]: Greatest thing about the ganja pie.
[SPEAKER_24]: It will always get bigger and bigger and
bigger.
[SPEAKER_24]: So the craft market will grow and you
know, our, our little mid market will get
[SPEAKER_24]: there eventually.
[SPEAKER_24]: So everybody will have a nice piece of the
pie to eat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you guys get strain lock?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you guys get tired of smoking the same
thing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if I gave you, I was like,
you could have a hundred pounds of herb.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you want like a hundred pounds of
Mike's favorite strain is the grateful
[SPEAKER_04]: dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you still taking a hundred pounds of
grateful dog?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to switch up and want some
strawberry or muted bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: You want some strawberry coffee?
[SPEAKER_19]: 10, 10, 10, 10, 10.
[SPEAKER_28]: And, and then with God, we got,
we got it like Rasta Bob out there keeping
[SPEAKER_28]: stuff, you know, keeping things natural.
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, we, we got a lot of interbred
stuff here in the, in the States.
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm proud of Rasta Bob, keeping everything
kind of irian fucking traditional,
[SPEAKER_28]: you know, that, that, that sun grown herb.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just call me an inbreeder.
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, you know, I'm, I, you keep it
traditional too.
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, I mean, you still supply some
stuff, you know, for some incredible
[SPEAKER_28]: people too, my guy, but you know,
I am proud of Rasta Bob for staying with
[SPEAKER_28]: tradition, man.
[SPEAKER_28]: I got, I got to troll you, man.
[SPEAKER_28]: You came in hot tonight.
[SPEAKER_28]: I got to troll you back.
[SPEAKER_28]: You came in hot.
[SPEAKER_28]: You're going to get trolled.
[SPEAKER_28]: Don't make, don't make me rush you,
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_28]: Don't make me rush you right now.
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm in front of the new table,
bro.
[SPEAKER_28]: You haven't been to the new table.
[SPEAKER_28]: We got to get you so I'm worried about
your safety.
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, I had a bad medical visit today,
so I'm trying to get you to the new table.
[SPEAKER_28]: I didn't stress too hard on that right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I wasn't going to go there,
but if you need anything, bro,
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody in this chat's got your back.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I like trolling on you, but definitely
nothing but love for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come sit at the table, take some dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want a hundred pounds of the same
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want a lot of different weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I feel like I get, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like after a certain amount of
time, I just don't, it just doesn't do it
[SPEAKER_00]: for me anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have switched up and then go
back to it.
[SPEAKER_24]: We have to be grateful.
[SPEAKER_24]: We have to be grateful that we are at this
point.
[SPEAKER_24]: We can be picky.
[SPEAKER_24]: Usually it was high grade.
[SPEAKER_24]: So you can be picky now.
[SPEAKER_24]: Would you have no herb or some herb?
[SPEAKER_24]: You want to have some herb, unless if I
can get a country in quality within that
[SPEAKER_24]: some herb, you can get a red stripe or a
green stripe or a gold stripe one.
[SPEAKER_24]: You at least know what you're getting when
you run out in the thing.
[SPEAKER_24]: All right?
[SPEAKER_24]: Respect.
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a couple things.
[SPEAKER_18]: I've had in my lifetime, just a couple
where I could smoke a hundred pounds of
[SPEAKER_18]: that and not complain and not ask for
anything different.
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe two or three, but that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to tell me a lead.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all want to go one of them at least.
[SPEAKER_18]: There's nothing.
[SPEAKER_18]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_18]: The pre 98 bubble set me back,
man.
[SPEAKER_18]: That was a life changer.
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, and if you ever, if you ever get a
real sour, a real sour, not some shit that
[SPEAKER_18]: somebody called sour, but a real sour,
that shit will blow you right off your
[SPEAKER_18]: feet.
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, white Mike.
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.
[SPEAKER_24]: Let me help the panel a bit.
[SPEAKER_24]: Let me help the panel a little bit.
[SPEAKER_24]: Uh, connection that we always go to,
we might not want to admit it,
[SPEAKER_24]: but you know, just, we find ourselves just
going back to it every now and then.
[SPEAKER_24]: We just want to grow it again.
[SPEAKER_24]: If we get a cut, we're going to run it
again.
[SPEAKER_24]: We just always have to have it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_24]: So, you know, it kind of grows on you.
[SPEAKER_24]: So not him grows on you.
[SPEAKER_24]: Be, you know, we were asked to have a
truffle.
[SPEAKER_24]: Wink, wink.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't get rid of the lemon G.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, the Terps are just too good.
[SPEAKER_12]: That makes me smile.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm with Cascadian with that bubble.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just can't get away from it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_18]: The pre 98 Bubba and the Hollywood pure
coach.
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a similar, a similar flavor
palette, the sweetness, the funkiness.
[SPEAKER_24]: Let me get one out of the jar real quick.
[SPEAKER_21]: I think mine would have to be really
amazing seeds from dragon flyer with
[SPEAKER_21]: medicine, a G 13 hash plant.
[SPEAKER_21]: I could smoke that every day, the whole
day, all day.
[SPEAKER_21]: And it just puts me in a really good head
space where I can get a ton of stuff done
[SPEAKER_21]: and focus really well.
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's makes me happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about you sequence?
[SPEAKER_04]: You've been quiet.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you like to smoke?
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I got this crescendo behind my head.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could smoke a lot of that, but Matt's
GMO probably some GMO GMO a lot of Mike's
[SPEAKER_04]: got some crescendo concentrates.
[SPEAKER_04]: That company makes a great crescendo
banner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: GMO is a really potent strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's one, like if you were going to put
a lot of it in front of yourself,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's one that you would pick.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause it almost always tests it like 30
plus percent.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if you're going to have a
shitload of a strain and you're going to
[SPEAKER_05]: get a tolerance to it, you might as well
get one that'll get you there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: If you guys ever come across the,
uh, star dog, Corey cut, uh, thank you
[SPEAKER_18]: later.
[SPEAKER_18]: You won't be disappointed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the one that smells kind of like
strawberries and watermelons and kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: real good for a commercial girl?
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't, I didn't get that from me.
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's allegedly the cut that I
made starstruck with allegedly,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I have no proof of that.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's the bubble.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at his face.
[SPEAKER_24]: Three.
[SPEAKER_24]: It's three.
[SPEAKER_24]: Uh, this one is fresh.
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, the cut, the cut is about a year
and a half, but this is maybe like three
[SPEAKER_24]: months right in my perfect smoking zone.
[SPEAKER_24]: I hate to admit it, but I will admit it.
[SPEAKER_24]: I just keep getting, well, you know,
I have to always have a zip or a quarter.
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_24]: Right now or a half quarter.
[SPEAKER_18]: What does it smell like the bomb?
[SPEAKER_18]: What does, what does Bubba smell like the
bomb?
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.
[SPEAKER_24]: This one is sweet, but it's not that
artificial sweet.
[SPEAKER_24]: It's like sugary, but very mild sugar.
[SPEAKER_24]: Not like, I would say like maple leaf,
but not super sweet.
[SPEAKER_24]: If you understand, it's not the sweet part
of maple.
[SPEAKER_24]: It's more like that honeysuckle.
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_24]: It's kind of earthy and, you know,
earthy and sweet, you know, it's sweet
[SPEAKER_24]: earthy, but it's not like super sugary,
loud candy.
[SPEAKER_24]: You understand it's kind of mellow,
earthy, mellow sweet.
[SPEAKER_24]: It's the same vibration it gives.
[SPEAKER_24]: The same vibration it gives.
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, your smoke, it is kind of very
smooth.
[SPEAKER_24]: The first one you say, oh, it's very nice.
[SPEAKER_24]: And by the second or third bowl,
Bubba hug you up, give you one of them big
[SPEAKER_24]: bubba hug, you know, hug you up like
Bubba.
[SPEAKER_24]: But it's nice.
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a very pleasurable, you know,
and you can go to it consistently.
[SPEAKER_24]: I really have to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody else got a go to?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Mr. Bagsy made it back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, anybody else got a go to strain that
you can just smoke 50 pounds of and never
[SPEAKER_04]: get tired of it?
[SPEAKER_04]: We beat that question.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone who's grateful, someone who's
grateful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cass, you've been super quiet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything you can smoke a hundred
pounds of and not get burned out?
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a diamond dabber, aren't you?
[SPEAKER_24]: More into diamonds and shit.
[SPEAKER_24]: Which part?
[SPEAKER_24]: The not get burnt out like a hundred
pounds.
[SPEAKER_24]: Like you can just smoke any amount of
anything or variety is the spice of.
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh Lord.
[SPEAKER_24]: Sauces and spices.
[SPEAKER_04]: That hundred pound girl might take bigger
dabs than everybody in this room.
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sure of it.
[SPEAKER_24]: Me and Keith kind of hang in the dab,
that same dab.
[SPEAKER_24]: What do you call it?
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, the box.
[SPEAKER_24]: Micro dab room.
[SPEAKER_24]: The kindergarten dab room.
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I can relate.
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, half a quarter dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really set you right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Half quarters all day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to the half quarter gang.
[SPEAKER_18]: You might be able to smoke me under the
table with concentrates, but I can make a
[SPEAKER_18]: fucking magic trick out of your weed.
[SPEAKER_18]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_18]: I can smoke your weed out, your flowers
back.
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't hang on the concentrates.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've all got our thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Edibles make me goofy if I eat too many.
[SPEAKER_24]: So I don't like smoking.
[SPEAKER_24]: Somebody mentioned garlic earlier and I
can tell you the garlic was really good.
[SPEAKER_24]: We tried it out here and I can tell you
the crosses and the blend.
[SPEAKER_24]: So this is one of our garlic productions.
[SPEAKER_24]: I can tell you.
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know if you remember that drink
Horlicks like Ovaltine or we'll have one
[SPEAKER_24]: they call Horlicks.
[SPEAKER_24]: So they call garlic, you know,
kind of garlic, but a little bit sweeter.
[SPEAKER_24]: But still has a garlic smell, you know,
and it's strong.
[SPEAKER_24]: The effect there, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_24]: J-M-O, I'm not familiar with the names,
but the garlic turps or whatever really,
[SPEAKER_24]: really is doing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_24]: It and the peanut butter made a nice
influence on that one.
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, it was all candy and dessert
and, you know, wedding cake and this kind
[SPEAKER_24]: of sugary dish and doughnuts and ice cream
and the garlic and the peanut butter just
[SPEAKER_24]: kind of, you know, really diversified the
portfolio.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds pretty good.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you come back to Houston,
Bob, we'll get you real acquainted with
[SPEAKER_05]: that GMO.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm doing some long pushups.
[SPEAKER_24]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_24]: Every day I'm doing my long pushups.
[SPEAKER_17]: Exercise of lungs.
[SPEAKER_04]: GMO is like, it's like narcotic.
[SPEAKER_04]: It feels like other drugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes through your body in a different
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: It feels so nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a hug.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a big garlic hug.
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm going to push up somebody real quick.
[SPEAKER_24]: Just make sure you plant better than
Painted Lady.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, I'm going to head out of here before
I turn into a pumpkin, guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Anytime you want to chill and do a podcast
or whatever, just hit me up.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll text you later today to say thanks
for this.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Congrats on the new baby.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure you can hear them in the
background.
[SPEAKER_11]: Go enjoy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Reading projects.
[SPEAKER_11]: Later, Steve.
[SPEAKER_04]: Reading project.
[SPEAKER_04]: They forgot to pull out.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been going for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've gone for like two hours and 40
minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to be a long ass YouTube
video.
[SPEAKER_04]: I might edit some of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I might not.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't made any of those decisions yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to start right now and say,
thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a good time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for giving me two and a half hours
of everybody's evening.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anybody have any fun shit they'd like
to say that they got skipped on left out
[SPEAKER_04]: of before we start wrapping up this two
hour and 45 minute show?
[SPEAKER_21]: I just appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to say, if you're out there and
you don't have a community kind of like we
[SPEAKER_21]: have here on this, go create one.
[SPEAKER_21]: Start a local grow club.
[SPEAKER_21]: We didn't have one down here in Southern
Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_21]: We just got together with a local hookah
lounge and we're like, hey, can we host
[SPEAKER_21]: the thing there?
[SPEAKER_21]: And they're like, yeah, we can't have
anybody here right now because of COVID.
[SPEAKER_21]: So sure.
[SPEAKER_21]: So now they let us every second Tuesday of
every month, we can kind of take over the
[SPEAKER_21]: hookah lounge and we bring traffic to
there.
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's kind of on a neutral territory.
[SPEAKER_21]: So dispensaries can all come there and no
one's feeling.
[SPEAKER_21]: Weird about it.
[SPEAKER_21]: And share knowledge, share your grow
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, if you're the person that knows
the most in your area, teach the other
[SPEAKER_21]: people around you, you know, go be the
person out there.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's what 420 is all about is sharing
with the knowledge and seeds and
[SPEAKER_21]: everything else that we have and the
fruits of our labor.
[SPEAKER_21]: So go out there and create communities
wherever you are.
[SPEAKER_21]: And you'd be surprised how quickly,
you know, all kinds of cool things happen.
[SPEAKER_21]: I love that Steve.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a, there's a Steve in every state,
every community.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, somebody just has to step up and
be that guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why Mike is not in the chat right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see him, but why Mike would say do
your political part.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're the guy that does the lobbying,
the politics part, do that part,
[SPEAKER_04]: fill that role.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, everybody in here does a role in the
cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_04]: I make the seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keith makes the lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody does a part in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So find your role, find your niche in that
community and step up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're absolutely right, Steve.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate you for saying that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Build the community.
[SPEAKER_04]: Join ours.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, you could be a part of ours.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's, uh, I do my own show,
my own style.
[SPEAKER_04]: Steve's show is his show, a different
style, but both shows are fucking awesome
[SPEAKER_04]: in their own right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Embracing organics is a great show.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the shows out there, watch them all
find the one that works for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you may hate my show and love
Steve's, or you may love mine and Steve's
[SPEAKER_04]: and hate the other ones out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Find the ones that are the best for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: We aren't mad at you.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't watch our show, we don't even
know honestly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, join our community, create your
own, spread the vibe, uh, team cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to make all this legal for
everybody everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: So nobody has to go to jail for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody has to fucking worry about getting
medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody has to worry about recreating and
us grow enthusiasts can just grow our
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking asses off to keep all those people
happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So great message, Steve.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody else got anything else out there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I talk a lot.
[SPEAKER_28]: I just wanted to quick thank everybody is
in here, man.
[SPEAKER_28]: Steve, it has been a pleasure to fucking
talk to you again, fucking since the endo
[SPEAKER_28]: expo.

[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, we'll have to see you soon and Mike
and I look forward to seeing you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to come out here or we're
going to go out there and harass the shit
[SPEAKER_04]: out of you sometime soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Santa Cruz brah in the summertime.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to take somebody out there and
go, go visit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody else got any final words?
[SPEAKER_04]: Any Jerry's moments?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do they call it at the end when Jerry
did that shit?
[SPEAKER_04]: Jerry's moments, Jerry's thoughts,
Jerry's final thoughts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's got that for us today?
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, just, uh, thank you so much for having
all the cross-platform love.
[SPEAKER_26]: Uh, I was trying to count all of the shows
that were being repped because of you,
[SPEAKER_26]: like here, uh, yours, uh, potent phonics,
uh, the neighborhood, uh, shout out to
[SPEAKER_26]: operation grow.
[SPEAKER_26]: We've had, uh, and, uh, cause in true,
we show, uh, what was, uh, remind me
[SPEAKER_26]: again, what's the show grow for show,
please check them out.
[SPEAKER_26]: Uh, check us out neighborhood and,
uh, gosh, that's Michigan.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, racing organics is wrapped on
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a lot of people covering.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're in for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're always somebody.
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_26]: That's why I try to avoid it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_26]: That's why I'm like listing everything
off.
[SPEAKER_26]: You go to edit and you're like,
Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot someone real important.
[SPEAKER_26]: They're going to hate people like cannabis
community.
[SPEAKER_26]: Uh, really appreciate all the
cross-platform love.
[SPEAKER_26]: That's what it should be about.
[SPEAKER_26]: Like we're all just trying to learn.
[SPEAKER_26]: We're all just trying to do better for
ourselves and the people that we care
[SPEAKER_26]: about and our community, just like,
uh, don't panic.
[SPEAKER_26]: So it's saying, uh, do what you can
locally do what you can through the
[SPEAKER_26]: internet.
[SPEAKER_26]: Uh, even with, uh, whatever position you
are in your job, you can, you can make a
[SPEAKER_26]: difference.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be a Dick and show love.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably the best way to wrap it
up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good, good note there, Dave.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, good, good reminder.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing that that came from you
anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks everybody for joining me.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was awesome to have such a loyal
group of friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: I honestly didn't know how many people
would show up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this was amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to everybody on every screen
I'm looking at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big love, much respect for all of you
guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I look forward to getting all of you on a
show individually, uh, talking a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit more about your specified topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know everybody here is a special.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, big shout out to everybody watching.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to sign off with my friends
here, say goodbye.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'll be back to do like an
official wrap up for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was a glorious train wreck.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure what I expected when I
invited a hundred people to join me on a
[SPEAKER_04]: zoom meeting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure that if I expected 25 of them
to show up, but I am grateful that they
[SPEAKER_04]: did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I had a good time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I handled it well.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the first time I've ever hosted a
zoom meeting with approximately 25 people.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had a good time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will be doing things kind of like that
in the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe not with that many people.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is kind of a circus with that many
people, but I will be doing more things
[SPEAKER_04]: with more zoom guests now that I've had
some practice and gotten better at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to send a big thank you to each and
every person who stopped into that zoom
[SPEAKER_04]: meeting.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you were there for 30 seconds or two
and a half or four hours, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do appreciate all of the love,
the support, the participation without
[SPEAKER_04]: each and every member of the iry army.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would not be what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: You all feel your own role, your own
position, your own spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need every one of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
