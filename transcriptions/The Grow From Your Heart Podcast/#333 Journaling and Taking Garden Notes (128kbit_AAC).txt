Alright, you guys know I like to start
[SPEAKER_00]: these podcasts off by letting you know
what I've been dabbing on today It is 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been dabbing on a little bit of
everything I started off with some East
[SPEAKER_00]: Coast strawberries ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a little bit of holy grail batter
I've had some Durban Kush sauce and now
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm dabbing some Clementine ambrosia sauce
with gigantic crystals gigantic chunks in
[SPEAKER_00]: here It just smells like a big bag of
fresh clementines or some orange candies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a really juicy Wet smell to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can smell it from several inches away
from your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: This jar is quite terpy It's a nice size
jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells delicious and the dabs just
taste incredible The flavor doesn't go
[SPEAKER_00]: away when you take a dab of the clementine
You can take a drink of water five or ten
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes later and it kind of reactivates
the clementine flavor in your mouth It is
[SPEAKER_00]: delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm dabbing on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys enjoyed I hope you guys
had a great safe 710 and I also hope you
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoyed this 710 episode of the podcast if
you haven't checked that out go back and
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to the last episode and learn all
about 710.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, speaking of 710 there were some
celebrations happening here in Colorado on
[SPEAKER_00]: Saturday I was lucky enough to attend the
elevate oil spill and chill party our
[SPEAKER_00]: friends at elevate glass in Colorado
Springs hosted a party They have a
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful glass shop with some great glass
in there If you need a new rig a new pipe
[SPEAKER_00]: a new bong or a new smoking accessory and
you're in Colorado Springs, I suggest
[SPEAKER_00]: elevate at 517 South Tejon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you check them out They've got
great glass great prices great customer
[SPEAKER_00]: service They threw a party the store was

dab tent where you could hang out take
[SPEAKER_00]: some Dabs the folks from elevate were

Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's apothecary farms They host an event
called ambrosia days Apothecary is known
[SPEAKER_00]: for their Concentrates they don't carry
any flower in their dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They carry concentrates several different

[SPEAKER_00]: rare releases on those ambrosia days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they throw a party at another place
off-site This time the party was at a
[SPEAKER_00]: place called vibe I was able to do some
shopping then I had to go run some errands
[SPEAKER_00]: in Colorado Springs had to go hit the
guitar center and spend a bunch of money
[SPEAKER_00]: there that's one of my Favorite things to
do then I got to go over to the ambrosia
[SPEAKER_00]: days party and link up with some friends
That was a good time because as soon as I
[SPEAKER_00]: got out of the car, I ran into our buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miho Dabin Ran into all of the New Mexico
crew with up a huggy-duggy put up DS and
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole crew I'm not gonna list all you
guys cuz I'll miss somebody and then I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like an asshole But ran into the
whole New Mexico crew got to see a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of great people at the ambrosia days party
And I got to check out a place called
[SPEAKER_00]: strictly vibe for the first time really
cool place I'm sure if there are more
[SPEAKER_00]: events there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The place is totally Rostov themed
everything is red gold and green it kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of felt welcoming there So that's how my
710 pre 710 weekend went.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked up plenty of great concentrates I
had a nice variety to dab on throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the weekend hung out with Mike a little
bit yesterday had a nice 710 today then a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice little Instagram live video and now
here we are recording a podcast late in
[SPEAKER_00]: the evening on 710 let's get into the
point of this podcast you guys have been
[SPEAKER_00]: going for almost six minutes now and we
haven't even talked about anything so
[SPEAKER_00]: let's jump into it this episode of the
podcast Is going to be about keeping a
[SPEAKER_00]: journal for your cannabis grow keeping
notes keeping track of what you've done
[SPEAKER_00]: and having sort of a notebook To look back
through when something goes right or
[SPEAKER_00]: something goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about journaling your
cannabis grow Now before we talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping notes and taking a journal for
your grow Let me say that I can't promote
[SPEAKER_00]: people growing cannabis in illegal places
if it's illegal for you to grow maybe you
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't be doing that where you are I
can't advocate that legally I've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: say if it's illegal don't do it but if you
insist on growing cannabis in an illegal
[SPEAKER_00]: place maybe you shouldn't keep as careful
notes as the people in Colorado and
[SPEAKER_00]: California and other legal locations are
going to keep maybe you're keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: incriminating evidence maybe you want to
skip keeping a journal maybe you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: create a Google Doc and use code words or
something maybe you don't want to have
[SPEAKER_00]: this evidence laying around but like I
said before I don't promote you growing in
[SPEAKER_00]: an illegal area so that's something to
think about now with that being said if
[SPEAKER_00]: you live in a location where it is legal
to grow and produce cannabis take
[SPEAKER_00]: excessive notes write everything down
because those notes will come to use in
[SPEAKER_00]: the future now before we start talking
about taking notes let's talk about the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual journal I'm not too picky about
what kind of journal you use I've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: large notebook here a college-ruled
notebook on the table this is what I take
[SPEAKER_00]: notes in for the podcast this would work
fine as a journal open it up start writing
[SPEAKER_00]: in it whatever you do in your garden write
it down we're gonna talk more about what
[SPEAKER_00]: to write down it doesn't have to be broken
down into categories it doesn't have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: looking like homework just write down what
you do just open up the notebook write the
[SPEAKER_00]: date write what phase of the grow you're
in maybe write the strain of plants maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: on the front page write a paragraph if you
feel like like how many plants you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: how many lights you're running just write
just write in there then turn the next
[SPEAKER_00]: page and when you go in the garden write
down what you do today I did this and then
[SPEAKER_00]: just write that shit down you'll start
designing your journal the way you want it
[SPEAKER_00]: over time it will morph into what you want
it to be so I've got this college-ruled
[SPEAKER_00]: notebook here also next to me but I've got
another little side project of notes going
[SPEAKER_00]: on it's just a little tiny nine and a half
by six inch notebook it's a smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: notebook that would work just fine for a
grow journal I've seen guys use little
[SPEAKER_00]: tiny flip books little notebooks I've seen
guys use fancy binder notebooks or you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to even use paper you can use a
Google Doc if you want you can use the
[SPEAKER_00]: note application in your phone if you'd
like I would write rather see you use
[SPEAKER_00]: something that can't get lost that note
application you can delete that that's
[SPEAKER_00]: gone once you delete that he fucked up
it's gone forever have something maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: hard copy you can hold on to I like that
better but like I said if you're in an
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal place that becomes evidence in the
worst-case scenario so if you need a
[SPEAKER_00]: digital copy that's the way to do it
something you could delete really quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: if you need to that may be key something
that's password protected if you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway keep a journal it doesn't matter
how the journal is kept something that
[SPEAKER_00]: works for you all of our brains work
differently all of us set up our thoughts
[SPEAKER_00]: and projects differently as long as you're
taking notes and keeping track of things
[SPEAKER_00]: you were journaling and it doesn't matter
how it's done as long as you can read that
[SPEAKER_00]: shit don't scribble down a note thinking
you're cute writing just some quick
[SPEAKER_00]: shorthand stuff seven initial letters and
then a number and then milliliters next to
[SPEAKER_00]: it and you're gonna come back and you're
gonna go what the fuck did I even write
[SPEAKER_00]: like right clearly right legibly right
what you're talking about and then when
[SPEAKER_00]: you go back to read those notes in the
future you'll be able to repeat what you
[SPEAKER_00]: did before and you'll have a repeatable
outcome it won't be a guessing game so
[SPEAKER_00]: keep a simple journal keep a detailed
journal as long as you're keeping a
[SPEAKER_00]: journal on either paper or digitally I'm
happy now let's actually talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: journaling let's talk about the advantage
of keeping notes what is the advantage why
[SPEAKER_00]: do I want to read write this stuff down
there are several advantages to keeping a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow journal and keeping grow notes one of
the biggest advantages is let's say we're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to dial in a new nutrient system
I've been trying to get everybody addicted
[SPEAKER_00]: to veg bloom let's say you just started
using veg bloom as your first run you're
[SPEAKER_00]: dialing it in you know you don't know how
those plants are gonna react to veg bloom
[SPEAKER_00]: so let's start a grow journal for the veg
bloom grow on page one you say I'm in veg
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using this much veg bloom you write
down everything you put in there and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you grow you run the whole cycle you write
down everything you do and at the end if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're happy with it you can look back and
you go huh that's how I did it and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: repeat that if you're not happy with it
you can look back and see where you
[SPEAKER_00]: screwed up or you can see where you can
adjust and make it better that's the main
[SPEAKER_00]: point of keeping notes you can repeat it
if something goes right or you can correct
[SPEAKER_00]: it if something goes wrong you have got
records and at the same time you're
[SPEAKER_00]: creating an SOP which we'll talk about in
a little bit let's say you're growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in flower and about week four you
start seeing an issue you can use those
[SPEAKER_00]: notes from the past to help you correct
and identify a problem you can look back
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can say oh I fed it Kalmag too
many days in a row and you'll know because
[SPEAKER_00]: you wrote it down and now instead of
wondering what the problem is you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: note that says right here I fed it Kalmag
on Monday I also fucked up and gave it
[SPEAKER_00]: Kalmag on Wednesday it's probably got too
much Kalmag and now you've got a record
[SPEAKER_00]: also hopefully this will prevent you from
feeding it too much Kalmag because you
[SPEAKER_00]: wrote down in the journal all you have to
do is turn back two pages and see what you
[SPEAKER_00]: fed it two days ago see what you fed it
the past few days and you know oh I gave
[SPEAKER_00]: it Kalmag she won't need Kalmag for a few
days she'll be just fine so that's some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the advantages of keeping notes also
you've got data for the future if you love
[SPEAKER_00]: the outcome you know what you did you can
do it all over again if you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: satisfied with the outcome you can try to
fix it and then here's the best part grow
[SPEAKER_00]: again and change something and then see
how you like that outcome and then compare
[SPEAKER_00]: the two notes see what you did differently
and see what you did the same then you can
[SPEAKER_00]: create a test sample you can create a base
and you have somewhere to work from you
[SPEAKER_00]: just need data we're creating data for the
future is what you're doing with
[SPEAKER_00]: journaling and you can use that data to
identify and correct problems and prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: problems I almost overlooked that part
we're using the data to prevent problems
[SPEAKER_00]: at the same time now from a business
person's point of view if you're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: open a grow or you're trying to run a grow
or work at a grow for somebody maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to start your own business
as a grow is the guy with all of the notes
[SPEAKER_00]: and details going to be more likely to get
financial backing or is it going to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: guy with pictures of his plants which one
of those feels more reliable from a
[SPEAKER_00]: business standpoint so notes show
accountability and responsibility and
[SPEAKER_00]: initiative at the same time also science
is all about taking notes any sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: progression is about keeping notes how can
you know if you're doing better or worse
[SPEAKER_00]: if you don't have anything to compare to
so that's another thing about taking notes
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a very once you get into the business
world it will be required so start getting
[SPEAKER_00]: used to it now alright let's get focused
again I'm just talking to me when I say
[SPEAKER_00]: let's get focused I get rambly it may be
all the dabs alright so we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about taking notes what do we note note
everything note what you are feeding your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants note what you are mixing how much
water are you using to feed the plants how
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently are you feeding them when
you're mixing what is in the mix what are
[SPEAKER_00]: you putting in there how much of you what
nutrient and how much of it are you
[SPEAKER_00]: putting in there how often are they
getting fed that the way I would do this I
[SPEAKER_00]: would open up a page in the notebook and I
would write whatever it is if you're in
[SPEAKER_00]: veg whatever a July 10th veg week three
today I fed five gallons of water I mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: in five grams of base nutrients per gallon
I mixed in one gram of plus life per
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon and then I gave it two mils of Cal
Mag per gallon and then I pHed it I would
[SPEAKER_00]: write down what went in there I would
write down the EC I would write down the
[SPEAKER_00]: pH and I would write down the temperature
of my feed solution before I even carry
[SPEAKER_00]: that container of water to the plants to
water it all of that would get written
[SPEAKER_00]: down then I would water the plants to a
point of runoff to where at least a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of water is coming out of each plant
I've got a catch tray under the plants I
[SPEAKER_00]: would catch some of that water and I would
put my EC meter and my pH pin in that
[SPEAKER_00]: runoff water and I would document that
runoff water as well if you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple plants in large containers I
would check several of them I would check
[SPEAKER_00]: them all if you feel like you have time to
do it and document this when things go
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong those runoff numbers may be
indicators of when and where things went
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong and then you can look back at your
other notes and you can see what you fed
[SPEAKER_00]: it and we can compare that EC running off
and we can see what's going on and what
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not eating and why the pH is
fluctuating we can figure all that out
[SPEAKER_00]: through the notes you're keeping all right
so we're taking great notes of our feed
[SPEAKER_00]: we're measuring what goes in and what
comes out so you've got a notebook and it
[SPEAKER_00]: says veg week two or whatever I'm just
being hypothetical here veg week two July
[SPEAKER_00]: 10th fed this pH in was this EC in was
this temp in was this runoff measurements
[SPEAKER_00]: were this EC was this pH was this I don't
measure the temperature of the runoff that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't matter to me maybe it should but
it never has it's never come into play so
[SPEAKER_00]: write down what goes in write down what
goes out keep that document every time you
[SPEAKER_00]: feed and then if you feed it water or
something next time just write that down
[SPEAKER_00]: write down almost everything you do in
that grow almost think like it's an
[SPEAKER_00]: accountability sheet so if somebody were
to say hey what the fuck did you do all
[SPEAKER_00]: day then you could say oh I did this I
watered the plants I gave them this you
[SPEAKER_00]: have got details and then you've got
everything written down write down
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that you do in the grow so
we'll move on to sprays write down your
[SPEAKER_00]: sprays if it's a foliar feed if it's a
pesticide application if it's a spot spray
[SPEAKER_00]: of one plant write that down and by a spot
spray I mean if you're not spraying the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire room if you just see one area where
you're you see some spider mite damage but
[SPEAKER_00]: it hasn't sprayed and you don't feel like
you want to spray the entire crop yet
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you could just mix up a small batch
of pesticides and apply that to one small
[SPEAKER_00]: area that's what I call a spot treatment
just hit that hot spot get in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure it doesn't spread just if you
happen to see something or if you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific strain that you know gets mites
treat that fucker to pre-treat it so
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway write down every spray every
application whether it's a pesticide a
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding a preventative whatever it is
write down what you sprayed write down the
[SPEAKER_00]: product write down how much of it you
applied write down how much you mixed up
[SPEAKER_00]: say you probably makes up a half a gallon
or a gallon if you're a home grower put I
[SPEAKER_00]: mixed up a gallon of water what pesticide
did you put in there did you put 30
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliters of evergreen in there did you
put five milliliters of smite in there
[SPEAKER_00]: what did you mix up is there also 25 or 50
milliliters of push in there write it all
[SPEAKER_00]: down did you check the pH of that some
folks check the pH of their foliar feed
[SPEAKER_00]: some folks don't some products you should
not adjust the pH some products you do
[SPEAKER_00]: need to adjust the pH write it down if you
did or did not write down when it was
[SPEAKER_00]: applied write down if it was applied right
before the lights came on write down if
[SPEAKER_00]: you turned off the lights and applied it
write down how long those lights were off
[SPEAKER_00]: check the plants before you turn the
lights on and make sure they're dry note
[SPEAKER_00]: that you did that write down why you
sprayed why were you spraying what was
[SPEAKER_00]: your purpose write that down like act like
there's another person that's gonna come
[SPEAKER_00]: check your notes act like I'm gonna come
check your notes be like so I see that you
[SPEAKER_00]: applied azimax today why and then I should
see right underneath that oh I see why I
[SPEAKER_00]: identified spider mites or thrips in the
garden today and I felt that it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: best to apply a product so something like
that write down why you applied some
[SPEAKER_00]: products then later on write down the
results did you see any results were there
[SPEAKER_00]: dead bugs hanging off of the leaves were
there dead eggs somewhere in the grow room
[SPEAKER_00]: did the plants look like shit did the
plants look better write down the results
[SPEAKER_00]: what did you do and write down the results
write down why you did it what you did and
[SPEAKER_00]: how it reacted to it and then you're gonna
have to pay attention because sometimes a
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide application won't show you
problems for a couple of days so pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to that write that down also if
you rinse the plants off a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: will apply a foliar application some
products it's ideal to rinse them a few
[SPEAKER_00]: hours later write that down also detailed
notes also if you put in sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: surfactant maybe you're using some wet
betty or some cocoa wet inside your foliar
[SPEAKER_00]: feed write that down also everything that
goes in should get written down is my
[SPEAKER_00]: point so we're writing down the feeds
we're writing down the sprays that's just
[SPEAKER_00]: about everything that is going into the
plants if you're making your own soil mix
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't write this down if you're making
your own soil mix if you're making a super
[SPEAKER_00]: soil write down everything you put into
that that's crucial write that down to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cup if you're scooping cups or spoonfuls
or whatever write it down grams if you can
[SPEAKER_00]: highly detailed write that down your super
soil mix should be dialed in that's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: take you a couple runs to get it perfected
if you don't have notes that's gonna be a
[SPEAKER_00]: bitch dial that in you might not remember
what you did or smoking cannabis you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: we forget a lot of shit take a lot of
notes so let's move forward more notes to
[SPEAKER_00]: take room and environment notes document
the lights maybe you don't have a lumen
[SPEAKER_00]: meter but pay attention document the
temperature document the humidity and if
[SPEAKER_00]: you can pay attention to the co2 there are
several ways several devices it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: document all these things for you if you
just need the cheap hygrometer and a pen
[SPEAKER_00]: and paper do that write it down pay
attention see if you've got spikes see if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got valleys see if you've got
swings in your temperature and your
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity and your co2 hopefully you can
get something like a PL minder unit in
[SPEAKER_00]: there from PL grow systems and you can pay
attention to what's going on at all times
[SPEAKER_00]: but we don't all have that ability so
you're gonna have to write it down and pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention use one of those hygrometers and
thermometers that gives you a high and a
[SPEAKER_00]: low and it lets you know what the high got
to and the low was do the best you can
[SPEAKER_00]: with what you've got but take notes of
that because if it was too hot for too
[SPEAKER_00]: long your buds will show you that if it
was too cold for too long your buds will
[SPEAKER_00]: show you that if it was too humid for too
long your buds will show you that in the
[SPEAKER_00]: end and if you don't write it down if
you're not aware of it then you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: correct it and then you'll go why are my
buds so fluffy you won't realize it was
[SPEAKER_00]: because they were too hot for too long you
may forget so write down the room and
[SPEAKER_00]: environment notes that you see the
temperature the humidity and the co2 and
[SPEAKER_00]: if you can measure the amount of light in
there if you've got a lumen meter do that
[SPEAKER_00]: not required just helpful that helps you
know when to replace your bulbs and when
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes to commercial growing that that
really makes a huge difference on you
[SPEAKER_00]: moles and par watts and how much lighting
per square foot it really comes into play
[SPEAKER_00]: in the commercial growth anyway let's move
forward with what we're focused on and
[SPEAKER_00]: keep me focused today write down schedule
notes are you in veg are you in flower
[SPEAKER_00]: write down when veg started write down
when flower started write down what time
[SPEAKER_00]: the lights are coming on and going off
I've had situations now I use a digital
[SPEAKER_00]: timer so if the power goes out there's a
backup battery in there and it'll stay on
[SPEAKER_00]: the correct time a long time ago before I
was smarter than that I was using old
[SPEAKER_00]: analog timers if the power went out the
timer quit spinning so it is now wrong for
[SPEAKER_00]: however long the power is out my timer is
that many hours off sometimes I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: remember what time the lights came on did
I have those lights coming on at 7 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: or did they come on at 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember so now you gotta guess
write that shit down take some notes have
[SPEAKER_00]: some accountability notes will save your
ass in the long run one day you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: go oh I'm so glad I wrote that shit down
just write that down every little thing
[SPEAKER_00]: you can think of schedule notes what time
do the lights come on what time do the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights go off what time does my AC come on
what time does that hydro pump come on
[SPEAKER_00]: just write down everything if you're
running hydro and stuff and you've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: do different cycles if you're running a
flood and drain or some sort of ebb and
[SPEAKER_00]: flow write down how long it takes for that
stuff to wet and dry and how frequently
[SPEAKER_00]: you're watering that may help you out in
the future when you're trying to plan
[SPEAKER_00]: future grows so staying on the same note
of scheduling write down when you cut your
[SPEAKER_00]: clones write down when you sprout your
seeds write down everything you can you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys write down when those clones came out
of the cloner and into dirt write down
[SPEAKER_00]: every transplant and up pot that you can
transplant or that you can write down keep
[SPEAKER_00]: notes on everything that way you can keep
track so when you're looking to grow in
[SPEAKER_00]: the future you can say huh I don't have a
lot of time which plants veg the fastest
[SPEAKER_00]: out of my selection do I want to run this
og or do I want to run this strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: haze and you're gonna look back and you're
gonna see in your notes that that
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry haze only needed two weeks to
veg and that og kush needed four because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a slow veger and then you'll say oh
shit let's run the strawberry so notes are
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna help you so then of course you're
gonna want to write down when you start
[SPEAKER_00]: your veg cycle you're gonna definitely
want to write down when you start your
[SPEAKER_00]: bloom cycle also write down your
anticipated flush date if you anticipate a
[SPEAKER_00]: flush date write that down also it's wise
to create a feed schedule in advance and
[SPEAKER_00]: try to stay on top of it if you're gonna
grow for nine weeks write yourself out a
[SPEAKER_00]: seven-week feed schedule and tasks to do
throughout those seven weeks and then when
[SPEAKER_00]: you turn the page one day when you're
going to work you're gonna water the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants it's gonna say flush today and
you're gonna go oh cool I'm 10 to 14 days
[SPEAKER_00]: away from harvest I should start flushing
so prepare that write yourself a schedule
[SPEAKER_00]: along with your journal then also write
down when you started flushing also you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be paying attention to the trichomes
every day when you're looking in there
[SPEAKER_00]: with the scope write down what you see why
not write down today on July 10th I looked
[SPEAKER_00]: at my strawberry fields plant I looked at
the top buds all that all the trichomes
[SPEAKER_00]: were milky but toward the bottom there
were a couple of amber trichomes on the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom of the plant write that down why
not write that all down so you're writing
[SPEAKER_00]: down everything you guys I know I'm being
redundant but you guys might forget some
[SPEAKER_00]: of this stuff and I point out things that
you guys may have missed so write down the
[SPEAKER_00]: day you started flushing that way you
don't forget because I've forgotten you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: be in the grow room like did I give them
nutrients last time or have I given them
[SPEAKER_00]: straight water you'll be flushing for two
times and you'll fuck up and pour
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients in the plant you're like oh yeah
fucked up so write it down pay attention
[SPEAKER_00]: just have yourself some solid notes also
document any sort of defoliation and
[SPEAKER_00]: popping and topping and lollipopping write
that stuff down because some plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to react poorly to it some plants
are going to love it if you write down
[SPEAKER_00]: everything you know when you pissed off a
plant and you can look through the notes
[SPEAKER_00]: and go so this OG kush plant got pissed
off around week three what happened and
[SPEAKER_00]: you look at your notes and you go oh we
defoliated the fuck out of it on week
[SPEAKER_00]: three and we also fed it too much cow mag
you'll be able to look at your notes and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll have some sort of a an idea of
where you went wrong and that's gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: really helpful for when we go to grow that
same OG kush next time we'll go oh look in
[SPEAKER_00]: week three bro don't defoliate the shit
out of it and don't OD it on cow mag and
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll be much happier than it was last
time and then you'll learn how to dial it
[SPEAKER_00]: in notes will help you out with that a lot
now as a breeder and a pheno hunter this
[SPEAKER_00]: is one of my favorite parts document any
growth details and any thing notable does
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant make pretty colors does that
plant grow weird did it do something
[SPEAKER_00]: strange did it spit out extra nodes did it
spit out extra branches are the branches
[SPEAKER_00]: really close and compact together did
anything strange happen anything notable
[SPEAKER_00]: write down growth details did they get
really tall did it stay remarkably short
[SPEAKER_00]: did something happen when you topped it
did something happen when you did some
[SPEAKER_00]: lollipopping write down anything you
notice that is notable about the growth of
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant whether it's colors whether
it's just extra branching anything you see
[SPEAKER_00]: that may get your attention write it down
also if anything happened in that room
[SPEAKER_00]: environmentally when that weird change
happened document that on a side note and
[SPEAKER_00]: let's pay attention to that over the next
couple of cycles so let's say maybe it got
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe the air conditioner didn't go off
one night or maybe it got a little extra
[SPEAKER_00]: cool just because it cooled down tonight
and it got cool in the grow room and it
[SPEAKER_00]: rained and the room got a little cooler
and a more humid the next day you noticed
[SPEAKER_00]: that some of the leaves were turning a
little bit purple and now we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: note that it got a little cold in the room
and the leaves were purple the next time
[SPEAKER_00]: we grow it we're going to pay attention
does it have to get cold to get it purple
[SPEAKER_00]: or around this same time period does it
purple up on its own and we'll start
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing does those leaves get purple
because of cold or do they get purple
[SPEAKER_00]: because of straight genetics and then if
we want to make it purple in the future
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's just genetics we can add that
purple again or add that cold again and
[SPEAKER_00]: bring out the purple we'll know that it's
something that we can control just taking
[SPEAKER_00]: notes will give you more ideas and
sometimes you find things in a plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to repeat sometimes you find
things in a plant you don't want to repeat
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is the way to know how to do it
so a moment ago I mentioned the air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioner failure maybe the air
conditioner didn't turn off maybe the
[SPEAKER_00]: heater didn't come on maybe the fucking
air conditioner didn't come on and it got
[SPEAKER_00]: real hot document any incidents or
accidents that you may have in that grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room even if you fucked up it's your grow
room it's okay yeah I said earlier I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna come check your notes that's alright
I'm not gonna get mad at you I have fucked
[SPEAKER_00]: up a grow room I have fallen asleep with
the grow room with the flower room door
[SPEAKER_00]: open before guess what you got a seed or a
crop full of seeds I just cut it down and
[SPEAKER_00]: threw it away as soon as I saw the seeds
forming I was like nope I fucked up just
[SPEAKER_00]: threw it all away a hole it was just one
small room is like nine plants under one
[SPEAKER_00]: light but I fell asleep with that door
open I think I went and got myself some
[SPEAKER_00]: food I went ate and then I fell asleep and
I'd left the grow room door open because I
[SPEAKER_00]: was just letting it get fresh air I had
the fan blowing in there you know you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to stifle the room all day and
we can give it some fresh air you can but
[SPEAKER_00]: I ate pizza and got stoned fell asleep and
I woke up later and I was like oh you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what and I walked in there and it was
fucking dark in the room and the door was
[SPEAKER_00]: open and the light from the hallway was
just shining right in there so I knew
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a problem but as soon as I saw
the seed pods form those plants got killed
[SPEAKER_00]: so I fucked up so write down if you leave
a door open write down if you leave a
[SPEAKER_00]: light on write down if something goes
wrong write down if you did something
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong maybe you fucked up and overfed
something write it down it's gonna help
[SPEAKER_00]: you identify a problem in the future and
it will help you not do that mistake again
[SPEAKER_00]: also write down if you adjusted any
equipment did you change any air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioning settings did you change any
timer settings did you mess with that fan
[SPEAKER_00]: in the corner did you change anything make
a little section on your notes for today
[SPEAKER_00]: of any equipment that you changed what did
you adjust because small adjustments can
[SPEAKER_00]: create huge problems over several hours in
a grow room maybe you turned that fan from
[SPEAKER_00]: low to high and that one bud that it's
just been kicking the shit out of every
[SPEAKER_00]: time it rotates that one bud is gonna get
dried out the leaves are gonna start
[SPEAKER_00]: looking leathery and crispy it's gonna
start tacoing up or it's gonna get that
[SPEAKER_00]: claw and start clawing down it's gonna
start looking like a leather leaf it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna look like a fake plant instead of a
real plant that buds gonna get all dry the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's gonna be trying to send all of its
moisture up there to keep that one one
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of plant living and happy and it's
not gonna do it it's gonna make that whole
[SPEAKER_00]: plant struggle document that shit you can
be like oh yesterday I put that fan on
[SPEAKER_00]: three that's why it looks like shit I just
document things like that any sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: update or adjustment that you do did you
change a timer did you move a fan did you
[SPEAKER_00]: do something to the AC did you change the
co2 anything like that make sure you write
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff down now here are some other
things that you may not think about write
[SPEAKER_00]: down whenever you change your bulbs a lot
of people forget when the bulbs are
[SPEAKER_00]: changed it's a good idea if you've got a
bulb there's that little white part the
[SPEAKER_00]: ceramic part at the base of the bulb you
can write the date right on there on the
[SPEAKER_00]: bulb or I've taken little stickers just a
little green yard sale sticker or a piece
[SPEAKER_00]: of duct tape or whatever and write the
date of that bulb on there and stick it to
[SPEAKER_00]: the reflector changed all these bulbs on
710 2018 boom stick that sticker right on
[SPEAKER_00]: the reflector and then you've got some
sort of note but put it in your journal
[SPEAKER_00]: that way you've got it all right there in
one spot have some accountability know
[SPEAKER_00]: when those bulbs were changed because
bulbs don't last forever also write down
[SPEAKER_00]: when you changed your carbon filters your
air conditioning filters if you're running
[SPEAKER_00]: any kind of hydro or also if you're
running an RO system write down when you
[SPEAKER_00]: change those filters write that shit down
in your journal so that it's a never a
[SPEAKER_00]: question so if somebody says hey how long
have you had that fucking carbon filter
[SPEAKER_00]: you can go hold on it's in my journal you
can scroll to the the equipment page and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can go oh I put that in here on the
4th of July in 2016 and go okay it's time
[SPEAKER_00]: to replace that fucker then you just have
some accountability with that also I would
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend documenting when all of your
meters are calibrated your pH meter your
[SPEAKER_00]: EC meter your PPM meter whatever type of
meters you are using calibrate those
[SPEAKER_00]: things make sure you calibrate them and
write that down also here's something you
[SPEAKER_00]: may not think about right down if you're
using a respirator when you apply
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides and you should be right down
when you changed those cartridges the
[SPEAKER_00]: cartridges do not last forever they've
only got so many hours depending on what
[SPEAKER_00]: type of pesticide you are applying the
life of those cartridges can be shortened
[SPEAKER_00]: by different products they don't last the
same amount of time for each product if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a more volatile product I don't
know the correct word but if you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: more dangerous product then that cartridge
is absorbing more junk and it's not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to do you any good if the batteries are
dead and it doesn't make any noise all
[SPEAKER_00]: right you guys I feel like I have talked
about a lot of stuff we could journal how
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to journal how you want to
organize and arrange everything is up to
[SPEAKER_00]: you I'm sure I've made my point of write
down everything that you can now let's say
[SPEAKER_00]: you see a problem let's say that you're
walking into the grow room and you see
[SPEAKER_00]: that in the middle of week six of flower
these plants just look like they have
[SPEAKER_00]: totally gone to shit they're clawed up
some of the leaves are yellow the leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: are facing down they look like look like a
claw like a monster claw and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: yellowed out oh crap what happened it's
probably a nutrient problem it's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: from about three to seven days ago let's
get out the notebook let's scroll back and
[SPEAKER_00]: look to see what we did three days ago
what did we feed them anything weird let's
[SPEAKER_00]: look yesterday did we spray anything I
didn't spray anything let's look the day
[SPEAKER_00]: before do we spray anything no spray let's
look before that oh here we fed a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of stuff let's look through here
okay it doesn't seem to be like that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem let's look back okay we started
seeing that the runoff was different the
[SPEAKER_00]: runoff the pH of the runoff started
getting really low and the EC of the
[SPEAKER_00]: runoff started getting really high about
seven days ago what did we feed it about
[SPEAKER_00]: eight or nine days ago and you can start
doing that math and you can say oh shit
[SPEAKER_00]: look about 12 days ago maybe 10 days ago
we fed this plant way too much of
[SPEAKER_00]: something or we did we applied something
that did it and you'll just be able to use
[SPEAKER_00]: those notes as a map backwards and now it
has become a math problem just to figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out through deductive reasoning with your
notes what went wrong and if you wrote
[SPEAKER_00]: enough notes and you're paying enough
attention to the plants and you've got the
[SPEAKER_00]: connection that you need you'll be able to
find the problem then once you find that
[SPEAKER_00]: problem write it down in your journal then
when we grow OG Kush again we know that in
[SPEAKER_00]: week five not to try to feed it way too
much bloom boosters so this is what we
[SPEAKER_00]: call dialing in your grow this is why a
lot of experienced growers are sought
[SPEAKER_00]: after in commercial facilities we can dial
things in much more quickly because we are
[SPEAKER_00]: more familiar with these types of things
we know that some plants want some things
[SPEAKER_00]: we know that some plants are gonna react
certain ways and we've got an eye to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify those things and we develop that
skill through taking notes through
[SPEAKER_00]: practicing through observation and through
repeating this process also you guys if
[SPEAKER_00]: you think about it over several crop
cycles if you take good enough notes you
[SPEAKER_00]: were reverse engineering SOPs for yourself
you were creating a standard operating
[SPEAKER_00]: procedure for your grow you were dialing
it in you were starting to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: streamlined work process you're starting
to dial in the cost you're starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: dial in the efficiency and you can
streamline it a little better every grow
[SPEAKER_00]: by taking notes and seeing exactly how
much nutrient you're using seeing each
[SPEAKER_00]: step that you're doing where you could
kind of cut some time out by say by doing
[SPEAKER_00]: oh maybe I'm doing this wrong you can save
time here you could save time here you
[SPEAKER_00]: could save a few dollars here you can
learn how to not fuck up your crops you
[SPEAKER_00]: can learn how to prevent problems you can
see which pesticide applications worked
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see which pesticide applications
did not work you can see when to time
[SPEAKER_00]: things better keeping these notes will
help you create standard operating
[SPEAKER_00]: procedures that will work in a small scale
grow it will also be expandable to a
[SPEAKER_00]: larger facility now here's one last thing
that we should keep notes of in any sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of grow situation and that is your harvest
you want to keep notes on your harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: weights per plant per strain per room
however you want to do it keep notes also
[SPEAKER_00]: take personal notes on how you feel the
quality is of your product if you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: it lab tested do that and keep notes on
that that way we can see if we are
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing our harvest increasing our
quality also document how many harvests
[SPEAKER_00]: you get per year and let's see if we can
maximize your room maybe if we time things
[SPEAKER_00]: properly we can pull a whole nother crop
out of that room per year let's see what
[SPEAKER_00]: we can do for you the only way we can do
that is take notes and see if we can
[SPEAKER_00]: repeat our processes and see where we can
improve you guys so that is my episode on
[SPEAKER_00]: journaling and keeping a grow journal I
hope you learned something if you feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like there's something I missed that you
would like to contribute I would love to
[SPEAKER_00]: do an update episode you can send me an
email my email address is grow from your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart at hotmail.com you know I love to

[SPEAKER_00]: yet please do that simply go to YouTube
and search for the grow from your heart
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast and click subscribe alright
podcast world I know I asked for a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff at the end of every episode here I'm
like go follow me on patreon go stalk me
[SPEAKER_00]: on social media give me an iTunes review
there's all kinds of stuff I always ask
[SPEAKER_00]: for at the end of the show but I would
really appreciate it if we could get my
[SPEAKER_00]: strain a rise on Leafley the way to do
that is to go to Leafley and go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: submit a new strain tab and then just
leave a review on a rise if you have ever
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked smelled grown consumed anything
about a rise and you feel like you're
[SPEAKER_00]: qualified to leave a review on there I
would appreciate that let's get a rise on
[SPEAKER_00]: Leafley go to Leafley.com go to the add a
new strain tab you may have to create an
[SPEAKER_00]: account that's always fun then once you've
got your account set up go ahead and type
[SPEAKER_00]: in some information about my strain arise
it is golden goat today breaker it is a
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid and I think it deserves to be
listed on the website Leafley alright you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys I want to thank you again for
listening to this podcast I'll be back in
[SPEAKER_00]: just a couple of days with fresh new
content I want to give a huge shout out to
[SPEAKER_00]: my boy Max from TNT extractions for
keeping it real so shout out to Max and
[SPEAKER_00]: until next time take a fat dab and give
your mama hug for me you you you
[SPEAKER_00]: you you you you
