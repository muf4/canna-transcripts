[SPEAKER_00]: And of course I do include a link in the
show notes and in the video description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for the throat clearing right
here at the start of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been taking some monstrous dabs of
some machine live batter from a friend
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't want to be mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fist bump, you know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does mess up the throat, but it puts me
in the greatest mood, the greatest zone
[SPEAKER_00]: for podcasting that machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It puts on these blinders.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I could really pay attention to is
that camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: These lights kind of went away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The notes are right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really digging the vibe of the machine
live batter other than the clogged up
[SPEAKER_00]: throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty phenomenal concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me for doing that rudely into the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was uncalled for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to all of the friends who
support the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy Mother's Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's quit rambling and focus in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's do a deep dive into mother
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mother plants are a very important aspect
of cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about what a mother plant is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll talk about how to establish a
mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll talk a little more deeply into
mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get started by talking about what a
mother plant is.
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that even mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we cultivate cannabis, oftentimes we
will find a plant that we kind of fall in
[SPEAKER_00]: love with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something you want to keep smoking over
and over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to keep growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a breeder, as a grower, I like to grow
something multiple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I grow it, I call it the
first date.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to give it the standard
operating procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The basic nutrients, the basic grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see how that plant reacts to the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second time, I'll say, well,
last time it didn't react to the cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't react well to the hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't like these nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have done better with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will give it those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I grow that plant, I'll take
notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will observe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will sample and I will make adjustments
every grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the third, fifth, sixth grow,
that plant will be banging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be doing much better than the first
time that I grew it because I've developed
[SPEAKER_00]: a relationship with that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how do I continue to grow that plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to keep a mother plant of that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just get into, so we know what a
mother plant is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That mother plant in the future is going
to be designated to give us clones to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: our genetics alive in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mother plant that stays in the room
unflowered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can take cuttings from that to turn
them into clones or clippings or
[SPEAKER_00]: reproductions of our original plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can continually grow this plant
over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one never goes into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We save it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like our little genetic preserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we get to a mother plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say we are either given a pack of
seeds or we are given a clone or we
[SPEAKER_00]: acquire a clone or a pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with a pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say we are given a 10 pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just are gifted a pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was super nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, hey bro, want some seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, I sure do or whoever,
whatever I called you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gave you a 10 pack of seeds and you
grew them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're going to find an amazing plant
out of that 10 pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find one that really stands out to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will do what is a phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will grow all of these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will carefully observe them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch how they grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a couple of plants in
there that really stand out.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's going to not even be desirable to
you, but maybe to somebody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's going to really stand out to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's going to be pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably going to get one that puts
out a lot of weight, one that really
[SPEAKER_00]: tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one of those will be super
potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always two that it's hard to
decide between which keepers you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about keeping one of those as a
mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would do, I would grow those seeds
until they are big enough to get a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about cloning earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would take three clones from each
seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got three opportunities to keep
these plants alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would grow them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would either, at this point,
what I would do as soon as my clones show
[SPEAKER_00]: roots, I would flower these plants that
have been growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're already established.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're already pretty big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just flower those out, see what
we've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll pull the males immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once these plants I put in flower show
male, I will also call that male clone if
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not looking for a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this phenohunt, we're just looking for
a mom to make a mother plant, for a good
[SPEAKER_00]: keeper to make a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to grow all of these
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to cut a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to put the mom, the original
plant, into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: When those show us sex, we will call all
of the boys, the small boys and the big
[SPEAKER_00]: boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we are only down to the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I should mention, carefully
label all of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I do it is either alphabetically
or numerically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just got plants A through Z,
or we're in Colorado, A through six,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever number six is in the alphabet,
or 12, depending on where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I number them, one through six,
one through 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when I take clones, the clones get
the corresponding number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clone number one came from plant number
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clones number two came from plant number
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clones labeled three came from plant
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes it easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if my plant number five shows that it's
a male, clone five is a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: If number one shows it's a girl,
number one is a girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets to stay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we eliminate the boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we grow out the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them you're going to love,
some you're going to hate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the one that you really, really do
love.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I run it, I may keep two,
maybe three of the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've eliminated the boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gotten rid of the non-desirable
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's really run these girls one more
time and see what we really love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do it the one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do it a couple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the girls you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we're just going to pick
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to say we found the one that
we really liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to say it was number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my case, it often is number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one's a boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two is quite often the keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number four is a champ.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just weird luck of the draw for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to say number two was a
fucking amazing female keeper plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to keep that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We flowered it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, back in the day, we kept a clone
of number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's over there in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've still got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know number two is the champ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That clone that is growing over there,
that is now your mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you establish a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cut the clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I do is I cut the clone off the top
of a veg plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put it in the cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let it clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let it root.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as it gets roots, I put it in a
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I flower my other plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've got nine weeks to find out what
the winners are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That other plant is going to grow over
there for nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before nine weeks is up, you've probably
decided what your favorite plant is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your favorite selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I would cut clones from my favorite
one again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've already got clones ready for the
next run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we cut a clone off of our original
seeded plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just cut a clone right out of the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it in the cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take two weeks to root,
ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I see roots, I flower the one
that's already in the pot, the big one
[SPEAKER_00]: that the clone came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to find the boys and girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull out the boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find your favorite girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know probably by week seven or week
eight what your favorite girls are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your other plants are over here that you
took clones of.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll have to come out of the cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll go into pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be nine weeks before we need
them for anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: My recommendation is around week seven of
flower on this run, cut clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those clones become your next run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You just cut those from your mother plants
that you've got sitting over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your favorite one over here will be
designated your mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move it over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focus now on mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have done a basic phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have found the mother plant we choose
to keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a nice bushy plant of that
mother plant right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cut a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been growing for several weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have not taken clones off of it by
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now's a good time to go and clean up this
mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of do a little bit of lollipopping,
a little bottoming just to clean it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to have some funky useless shit
at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just small wispy shoots coming off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take all that stuff off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I want to make a nice bushy plant
because this is going to be the plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: donates a bunch of cuts to me when I need
to grow again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how many clones I'm going to need
for my next run.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I know I need three, I don't need super
bushy of a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I need 25 cuts, I need to start topping
this plant strategically to make more
[SPEAKER_00]: branches and more arms so that I can
produce more clones to supply my growth
[SPEAKER_00]: for the next run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then every time you top it at the right
spot, it's going to produce double the
[SPEAKER_00]: nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next time you run it, you should have
plenty of clones available for the next
[SPEAKER_00]: run.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got 25 this time, you should be
able to get 50 next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem because you doubled all of the
spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm going to do is I'm going to keep
this big mother plant nice and healthy,
[SPEAKER_00]: as healthy as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep it under at least 18
hours of light and six hours of darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I will go 19 hours of light
and five hours of darkness just to prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: any sort of auto flower, any sort of ideas
that that plant could have darkness long
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do give them sleep time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe anything wants a little bit of
sleepy time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dog needs a nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants can use a nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, your equipment can use a nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we turn off the lights for just four or
five hours a night, that will save us a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of electricity, a lot of time on your
bulbs, a lot of time on the air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioner, a lot of things that don't
have to run unless it's the winter and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you got to turn on a heater.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole nother conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them under at least 18 hours of
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will go 19.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will go 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will do the 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not my recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, we all need a nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice that they'll start getting
spindly and growing too tall and getting
[SPEAKER_00]: weird on you if you don't give them any
nighttime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that weird growth is a symptom
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just they're freaking out, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need a nap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, feed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another very important thing is to feed
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feed them a high nitrogen diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I focus on just mainly the basic NPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a good vegetative nutrient solution,
you will get most of the things needed for
[SPEAKER_00]: your mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may need a little bit of cow mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely feed them microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing is I really step up my pesticide
application or my integrated pest
[SPEAKER_00]: management routine in the mother room area
because it all starts with healthy mother
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your mom start getting unhealthy,
[SPEAKER_00]: your stock is unhealthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all starts right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have very healthy mother plants if at all
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep insects away from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep powdery mildew away from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep any viruses away from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep those mother plants clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are sacred.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a breeder, everything sacred to me is
those mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them clean, safe, and healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step up your integrated pest management
game in that room is where it all starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't get healthy cuts,
you can't get healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't have healthy veg plants,
you can't have healthy flower plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't breed healthy seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all starts with healthy moms,
healthy clones, healthy veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get those mother plants super healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them a lot of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them a lot of strong vegetative
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also give them a lot of cleanliness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them a lot of pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure there are no bugs on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it all starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else to talk about is the goal
and shape of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many clones do you need?
[SPEAKER_00]: I top them early because when I top them,
all those lower branches start growing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about when you've got an
intersection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it a node.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the branch coming up and
shooting off to the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just one more little space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then right above that going off to the
right is one more little space,
[SPEAKER_00]: little branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cut that one out of the middle,
you've now got the one going up off the
[SPEAKER_00]: left and the one going up off the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those eventually will even out and start
growing as new apical dominant tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you top it right, think about that
strategically when you are cutting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like I'm giving you the finger
here on the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a piece sign turned upside
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the one going up the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you got your left branch and your
right branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cut that one out the middle,
that's a much better hand gesture there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cut that one out the middle,
these two will compete and become new
[SPEAKER_00]: tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later on, those will both become clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take out this clone now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get these two in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then those two, repeat the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Repeat the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Repeat the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes into like fucking 64 if you do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mathematically bra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep cutting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep topping and you will make more tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that will happen eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do this process as long as you
want, but eventually you're going to need
[SPEAKER_00]: to replace your mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, people are going to say,
what about genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetic drift, that is not a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a full podcast on why genetic
drift does not apply to cannabis and why
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't apply to cloning cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wash genetic drift right out of your
brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your mother plants are healthy,
you cut clones properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetic drift will not be a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a full episode on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do some research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that will need to be done is you
will need to re-clone your mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will get big.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will get tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start getting old.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant is, it's old no matter how
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you clone the plant,
that plant is still as old as that
[SPEAKER_00]: original clone, so it's got that much age
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to keep these plants fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to re-clone them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I do every three to six months,
depending on the plant, the Sun Kiss plant
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't grow super, or the Platinum Tangy
doesn't grow super fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stays kind of smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take as much time.
[SPEAKER_00]: MAC-1 doesn't take as much time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can re-momb that one every six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Mighty Congo, the Chem De La Chem,
they need re-mombed about every three
[SPEAKER_00]: months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I do, I simply cut, a nice batch
of clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably cut one row, five clones off of
each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got five Congo, we got five Chem De
La Chems, and then I just let those root,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the best two, I pop them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best two of each one, I pop them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I let them grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best one goes in the flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second best one becomes the new mother
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That becomes my new genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one that I get to grow from
from now on, and that's going to repeat
[SPEAKER_00]: the process forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that big plant that I cut the clones
from, I either flower that, which most of
[SPEAKER_00]: the time I do not do, or I simply cut it
into small pieces and throw it away,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I don't need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel the need to just grow it
because I've got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what that plant was meant for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was meant to provide clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It served its purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got all the cuts I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can chop that big bad dog down and throw
it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they'll go outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they get flowered in a flower
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time it's better for me just
to eliminate that plant, start fresh with
[SPEAKER_00]: those new cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're already so big, they're already
stretched out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm re-mombing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get unruly and unshapely.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not strategically cloning it all
the time and on top of it, it will get out
[SPEAKER_00]: of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if so, it will get root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll just get old, re-clone it,
re-momb it, get it started fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do that again about every three to six
months is how I redo my moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about another scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people, myself included.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my personal grow, I'm very limited on
the amount of plants that I would like to
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of wasting space on mother plants,
in some cases what we will do,
[SPEAKER_00]: we will use a dedicated veg plant as our
mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say you've got a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that this clone is the winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've done your phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your clone right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right before you're going to flower,
take a couple of clones off of it and save
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got three or five clones in the
cloning area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You move that plant into the flowering
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll flower in nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now your clones are in there for two
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come out of the cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go into their pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got two weeks in the cloner,
two or three weeks in the small pots,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then like six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, what do we got?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's five.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got four weeks in the bigger pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then move those right into flower and take
a couple of cuts off of them and use your
[SPEAKER_00]: veg plants as your mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of keep a perpetual cycle going.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to say, what about
genetic drift?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm going to say that is not a
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you are keeping your plants
healthy, excuse me, as long as your veg
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, your donor plant is what I want to
call it, is a healthy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your clones will come out healthily.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do it properly, take good care of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done full episodes on clone care,
all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me talk about how to do that again
because I feel like I breezed over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to flower it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant is your mom plant and your
flower plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a veg plant that will be flowered at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it into the flower room right before
you change the light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take three to five clones off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those clones will be the next run.
[SPEAKER_00]: While this bad dog is flowering,
your clones are rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll root.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll take two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as these plants in the flower room
start showing sex and going into flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got plants to move from a clone
dome into pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as they really start banging out
flower, you've got to up-pot these and get
[SPEAKER_00]: them ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start prepping them for the next run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slide them into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as these finish, take a couple of
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Repeat the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a perpetual cycle without
keeping mother plants because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping veg mother plants at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies, gentlemen, boys, girls,
pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers,
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, mothers, fathers, Paul and
