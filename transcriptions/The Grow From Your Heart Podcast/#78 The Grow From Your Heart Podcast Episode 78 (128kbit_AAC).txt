[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, that was the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do the rest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep going, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't listen to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know the intro?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I come on and then it's hard to listen to
the rest because you're a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, all you guys that are growers and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Clint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm back.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be a crazy episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can already tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, it's time for 78 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: 78.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to skip the intro because
Clint already crashed the whole fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: party and I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said we might have one mishap at the
start and I was like, it's going to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: good mishap then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to make it a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't believe how many false starts
I've had on this podcast when I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: recording by myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like I have a really hard time
busting out the intro when I'm alone,
[SPEAKER_02]: but when there are people here,
it flows out like nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like this time you did a real good
job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't skip a single word.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, you got everything you wanted to say
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have just turned your microphone
down and just kept you down until I
[SPEAKER_02]: introduced you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just kept yelling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got even louder.
[SPEAKER_02]: So ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joining me today is my friend Clint.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a local comedian.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least that's what he claims to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've already seen his skills.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint is an amateur pot smoker.
[SPEAKER_02]: He usually takes two puffs of sour diesel
and today he took three.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still undecided because I can't
remember if I took two or three.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you took three because you were
fucking higher than usual.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: You going to be good?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're here right now with all these
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mean all the people that are
listening, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't think there are more people
here, do you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, just the ones behind you.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, you guys, you can already tell
what kind of episode this is going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do need to send a huge thank you shout
out to Kat and Coot from the Mystic Roots
[SPEAKER_02]: Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: They let me play their music on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really super cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have any advertising to do at the
start of this show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I already fucked it up anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't fuck anything up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it when you're here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You break up the monotony.
[SPEAKER_02]: You make it explosively fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: You make it entertaining.
[SPEAKER_02]: You good?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Paul texted me and I accidentally looked
at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I missed all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I missed everything you said.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a jerk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint's got what we've been referring to
as goldfish brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: About every 30 seconds, Clint resets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Grow From Your Heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, he's back at the beginning again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So guys, the first thing that Clint and I
want to do is review the Doug Benson
[SPEAKER_02]: album.
[SPEAKER_02]: On 420, Doug Benson came to Denver,
Colorado, and he did three shows and
[SPEAKER_02]: recorded all three of them for his new
comedy album, which was called Promotional
[SPEAKER_02]: Tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it came out just a couple of few days
ago here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it came out on the 5th.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was the 9th, but you're high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was 5'9", not 9'5".
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you'll be all right eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: God, I hope this is funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this is just me just being a fucking
dick and your fans have to listen to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I feel so bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm having fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully they will, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you get a certain percentage or do you
know anybody in Pueblo listening?
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of our Pueblo friends listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I found out that Drew listens
and that... On Dustin's list?
[SPEAKER_02]: Joe listens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joe and his new... Joe and his friend that
I just met.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to call him Kevin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joe and Kevin listen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not know that those guys listen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to Joe and Kevin that I
recently saw on Baca's couch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Baca listens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we get a lot of local listeners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Arnie listen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark has been listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's finally paying attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's make this a real big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: What if this podcast became a real big
deal just in Pueblo?
[SPEAKER_01]: When a comedian would come down or when a
band had come through, it'd be cool for
[SPEAKER_01]: them to...
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, it'd be cool to go get a little bit
too high with Rasta Jeff, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's the morning radio show before
the show?
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of, but more so like it's a get for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd almost be like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be great to have that radio show
idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you're saying is that since the
Wild Cousins are presenting a comedy show
[SPEAKER_02]: with a man by the name of Sam Talent...
The funniest man I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: On July 23rd, 2015 at the Rainbow Bar,
are you saying that maybe we should have
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam Talent come be on the podcast and be a
little bit funny and we could talk to him
[SPEAKER_02]: about his cannabis experience?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe he's got a funny weed story?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what you're thinking we could do?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me ask him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will ask him.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would love for that to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you got to come too, because I don't
know the guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the future, Clint is going to try to
get a comedian by the name of Sam Talent
[SPEAKER_02]: on the show here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he's going to do a show at the
Rainbow Bar, July 23rd, 2015.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a free show, but donations are
encouraged.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're listening to this show,
show up, pay $5,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's what I feel you should do.
[SPEAKER_02]: The show will be worth $5.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay $5.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go be a cheap ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a free show.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll look like a pimp if you throw down
five for the free show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you should do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a fun show.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's got my buddy Paul Rosales and my
other buddy John Bueno on that show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is my little comedy crew called
the Wild Cousins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the Wild Cousins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate it, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wearing my Wild Cousins shirt
yesterday and people like to give me the
[SPEAKER_02]: weirdest looks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: The shirt has a kitty cat shooting an
assault rifle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a six foot five dude with dreadlocks
and people look at me with great
[SPEAKER_02]: confusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just such a weird shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a whole bunch of them and we just
like have never tried to sell them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so fun that we just gave up on them
immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am thinking about getting Grow From Your
Heart podcast t-shirts made here
[SPEAKER_02]: eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rock one of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully by episode 100, I'll be able to
give a couple of them away.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should talk to Barrett.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Barrett.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Barrett.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that Last Leaf?
[SPEAKER_01]: Last Leaf, I think, is Moe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought they were together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moe's not doing shirts, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moe goes like, I think unless Barrett
bought up Moe's shit and they just call it
[SPEAKER_01]: the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this just got real local.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go back to talking about
funny weed shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went and saw Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: On 420, we saw Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did three shows at the ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my favorite comedy club on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really quickly, I always shout out to
Baker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Baker was watching my Periscope broadcast
last night and having a conversation with
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was slightly honored.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, Baker's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He came out and shook my hand the other
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recognized him and I waved at him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he recognized me, probably because I'm
fucking ridiculous looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the tall thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the tall thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I go, hey, Baker, thanks,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was after the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we had actually moved pretty fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting rambly again.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super high, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Baker's fucking cool as shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, this is great because I've never
seen Clint this high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's almost uncomfortably high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can see him like re-situate himself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every few minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to lead into something
that we're going to talk about in a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit here, too, if we have time,
because Clint keeps talking a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four episodes later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to make a reference and then I
forgot the dude's name.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we won't even do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels like you are Pete Holmesing me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's happening here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm being Pete Holmesed.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you ever watch any of Doug Benson's
podcast, Pete Holmes will love to just
[SPEAKER_02]: interrupt and drag on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're Pete Holmesing me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to do a little... On 420,
Doug came and did those comedy shows at
[SPEAKER_02]: ComedyWorks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint and I and a couple other people had
the honor of going to the third show that
[SPEAKER_02]: night, which may have been a mistake.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've talked about that on the podcast
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we downloaded the CD on the day that it
came out and we listened to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the fun part that I noticed right
away is he used the opening from the show
[SPEAKER_02]: we attended.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure he did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because he talks about how he was
trying to get too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, that was definite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not like you could have done that
twice.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even later in the album, you can hear
him and he's not that high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just like, oh, man, I wish I'd
went to those other shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were a couple of pieces that I'm
certain came from our show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I know that there's someone like,
oh, he did not do that at our show because
[SPEAKER_02]: he sounds awake.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of my favorite parts of the entire
album is that on track one, there are
[SPEAKER_02]: multiple times when I can hear Clint over
laughing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint is like a dick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, it's great, dude, because it's
genuine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're laughing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're such a big dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your laugh is so low that it just
shakes the entire comedy club when you
[SPEAKER_02]: laugh.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're in the front row in that little
pit area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of sound right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And dude, you're coming through on the mic
so well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can just hear Clint like,
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so fucking funny hearing your buddy
laugh on a comedy album.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: The shitty thing is the comedy album,
not that funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Doug's my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what sucks?
[SPEAKER_01]: I might've been the funniest thing on that
album.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're the funniest thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please don't tell Doug Benson I said that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Ballweed might be the funniest
thing on that album.
[SPEAKER_02]: God, he would hate me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He might.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're being honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I just didn't think it was that good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went and saw that show and I had a
prejudice against it already, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I was already a little mad at him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first track, is 25 minutes of Doug
reading tweets on his comedy album.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I know that's, it's what he does in
his live show, but he's just riffing off
[SPEAKER_02]: of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I was going to do a comedy album,
if I were a comedian, I would put
[SPEAKER_02]: together, I would Joe Rogan that bitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would put together the tightest one hour
that I could come.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it might take you two years to do it,
but you're real happy to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first album is 25 minutes of him
reading tweets.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm the first track.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second track is called Watch This Not
That, where he plays a game that he
[SPEAKER_02]: normally plays on his podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: For free.
[SPEAKER_02]: For free.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it felt like I paid $5 to download a
podcast, basically, because I listened to
[SPEAKER_02]: his podcast frequently and it didn't feel
any better than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That son of a bitch turned 50 on us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden he became a money
hungry fucking capitalist.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't even smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all a ruse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't smoke.
Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, about this album.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The album, like I was saying, the first
track is reading tweets.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second track is talking about
something that he normally does on his
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then he actually tells a joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he tells a couple more jokes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he promotes his other podcasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he promotes another podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he promotes his other podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he talks about traveling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he actually does a really good
joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a well put together album.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that sucks because Doug's one of my
favorite people.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I called Doug my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knows who I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we contact each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to see one of your friends put
something out like that, it's almost like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh man, you could have done a little
harder on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most comedy albums, the comedian will
start with a decent story and then tell
[SPEAKER_02]: you a couple of jokes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then by the time you've forgotten
about that first story, he'll tell you
[SPEAKER_02]: another part that reminds you of that,
that refers to that to make you laugh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doug has already forgotten the first part
of his act by the time he's 20 minutes in.
[SPEAKER_02]: He can't do a callback.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm doing right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got Clint too high today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint got himself too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The podcast sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of, if you could give Doug Benson's
album, the podcast doesn't suck bro,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to make it rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could give Doug Benson's album up
to five pot leaves, a scale of one to five
[SPEAKER_02]: pot leaves, how many leaves are you going
to give him?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to get one pot leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to get one pot leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I'll give him two, maybe two and a
half or three, but it definitely was not a
[SPEAKER_02]: four or five star performance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's your friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you're being generous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm being mean too, but there's
just so many, there's so much to do out
[SPEAKER_01]: there now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I could download anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that's that, that album right there
is my only introduction to Doug Benson.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only thing I know of him other
than his podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am the perfect demographic to go,
dude, like I'm not a cult follower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wouldn't, I'm mad that I bought this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm mad that I went to that show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was 25 bucks that you've spent
on being disappointed twice now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could have done that with a hooker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you're disappointed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're paying $25 on a hooker.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's gotta be the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am not getting any in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to upgrade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_02]: $25 hookers, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to move on from Doug.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey Doug, sorry I had to bash your album,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to put it together more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still like you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still love you, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to come to your show on the 5th
of July.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see you there.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the Comedy Works in Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've already got tickets.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure that Clint wants to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm not going.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I got someone else I could take.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll be there, Doug.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wasn't, I like the way that Proops
put together a comedy album.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the way Ari put together a comedy
album.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got more continuity is the word I'm
looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: It flows a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd prefer that out of a comedy album.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you watch that Bill Burrow album?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I did see that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: The black and white one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's it called?
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, shit, I don't remember now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I expect out of a comedy
album.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's hard to be like, all right,
well, here's this guy who's perfect at
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's Bill Burrow to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's perfect at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He works so hard at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so exciting to watch somebody be
perfect at something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anthony Jeselnik is damn near perfect at
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, it's just, I think that Jeselnik has
his routine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Bill Burr could just go off on
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucking lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so beautiful to watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so most of those bits that he has,
he's kind of half improvising as he's
[SPEAKER_01]: telling the joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knows how long and what beats he wants
to hit, but it's not like that regimented,
[SPEAKER_01]: I say it like this, Jeselnik kind of way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jeselnik is kind of a robot in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you've said it plenty of times,
like he counts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he counts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see his throat moving when he
counts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can see him say the word 11.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bill Burr can go in there and do his
routine and then break away and do some
[SPEAKER_02]: dance moves and then go back to the
routine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love that about a comedian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Proops has that ability as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, he's so fucking smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when we were talking to him,
when he smacked you that day about that
[SPEAKER_01]: story, it was just so much fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was just being in the room with him was
fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got that storyteller personality.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to get Greg Proops on this is
not happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Season three or two is coming out pretty
soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're way off topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're rambly, but that's all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint's coming back around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can feel him connecting a little more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The goldfish in his brain is not swimming
in such short circles.
[SPEAKER_02]: The laps have gotten larger.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got sweetie birds now going around my
head.
[SPEAKER_02]: He upgraded.
[SPEAKER_02]: The squirrel that runs on the cage will be
back pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave him a smoke break.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody sent me in.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, you're getting almost funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty fucking dumb.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost tried to talk over it,
but then I was like, we got to give him
[SPEAKER_02]: credit for that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody sent me a Facebook message and it
was a good question for Clint because they
[SPEAKER_02]: said, how much should I be smoking?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: One.
[SPEAKER_02]: One.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, Clint should have only taken one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it seems like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the beauty of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're using medical marijuana,
the beauty of it is that it's up to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you have chosen to medicate
yourself with medical marijuana because
[SPEAKER_02]: some doctor isn't saying take two of these
every so often.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's up to you to figure out how many
puffs off of this bowl or how much of this
[SPEAKER_02]: joint I need to smoke to ease my medical
condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess if you've never smoked,
light up a joint and take two puffs and
[SPEAKER_02]: then see how that does.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's way too much, next time only
take one.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that didn't do it, take three next
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make a smaller joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Roll a smaller joint and don't get as
high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard for me to tell you how much you
should be smoking because I just watched
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint take three hits off of a bowl of
some pretty high grade sour diesel and he
[SPEAKER_02]: is high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff took two and then two fucking dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm about to take another dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like fucking dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dabs are my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint says dabs are drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see why he says that, but it's all
about what you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you smoking to medicate yourself?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're smoking to prevent seizures,
smoke as much as you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoke all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really just smoke until you're
comfortable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as you're smoking isn't hindering
your ability to be a productive person,
[SPEAKER_02]: as long as it's not causing you a
financial problem, a health problem,
[SPEAKER_02]: a mental problem, a motivational problem,
a relationship problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as you're not using it as a
crutch, as long as it's not an anchor or
[SPEAKER_02]: something negative, as long as it's not
causing a problem is my point here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoke as much as you feel comfortable
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't recommend every day trying to see
how high you can get.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need to be Joey Diaz and try to
see the fucking devil every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why people want to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But try it once.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just push the limit.
Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the thing is because I'm
comfortable.
[SPEAKER_02]: You kind of are pushing though.
[SPEAKER_02]: That third one was your limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're pushing it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pushing the limit, but not like going to
see the devil.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get cross-eyed and don't take seven
dabs your first try.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, that's what I get.
[SPEAKER_01]: That fucking peer pressure is a
motherfucker though.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not at our age, but I remember when we
were 16, 18, I would have done anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For you to think I was cool, I would have
done anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have stabbed the motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially if I was going to get laid at
the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, if I could get laid, I didn't get
laid until I was 18 because I was just a
[SPEAKER_01]: late bloomer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm just a skinny fucking white kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You made up for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing okay now, but it's weird to see
that fucking goldfish reset.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here he goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: New thought process for Clint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Want to go for a bike ride, buddy?
Thanks, buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He gets that ADD.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did lose it, buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got your back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the host.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm paying attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: No edits.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm leaving all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm leaving all your rambles in today.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get to deal with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your punishment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get to listen back to yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll be like, that guy's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoever was on the show that day was
fucking great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like Clint maybe only needed two today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to see the devil.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to see the devil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do that every day, but do it once in
a while if you need to.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to see what's on the other
side of that wall, take another dab or
[SPEAKER_02]: take another puff off the bowl and see
what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take a puff off of this dab
rig right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm smoking some Girl Scout cookies made
by the Turpax crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: I picked it up at Green and Healthy
Wellness in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to the Grimy Gatsby.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Damsel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also shout out to Joe.
[SPEAKER_02]: John Randall's Jr. John Randall's Jr. I'm
going to take a dab, but we need to get
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint started on some sort of rant before
I do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your brain?
[SPEAKER_02]: Here he goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do an open mic every Thursday at the
Rainbow Bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I've told everybody about this
plenty of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a comedy open mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jeff's come down a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got friends that come down and it's real
fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't charge anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's free, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's I mean, you can buy alcohol if you
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just come in and sit around like I
don't drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't ask me to buy anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't expect anything of you if you
don't drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're there for the comedy,
you might have brought somebody that was
[SPEAKER_01]: able to drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all they like.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to bring business into the
rainbow and get people in front of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the trade off.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have the building for us to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they make plenty of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: The regulars are there at the bar
drinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you guys are bringing in the
other group that are buying drinks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm just asking people to start coming
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm there occasionally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't commit to being there every night
because I'm a busy man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want anybody there every week
either, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're if you're not there to tell
jokes every week, don't come out every
[SPEAKER_01]: week.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would suck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I see all of your rehearsal material
and then get bored of you if I come every
[SPEAKER_02]: week.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you came out once every three
months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once or twice a month is my goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once or twice a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even asking that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm just wanting once every three
months out of just one of my friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and you hear the sadness in his
voice, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nah, it just sucks because like last night
we went to go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were going to do it last night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's Thursday, but we were going to do
one last night and no one showed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it fucking broke my heart,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just we get all everything all set up
to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bartender sitting there, you know,
10 o'clock comes around and nobody's
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a bummer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been in bands for several years and
I've played to the bartender for several
[SPEAKER_02]: shows and it's almost practice,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we didn't even fucking do anything
because we're just like, no, dude,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't I don't want to fucking do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to perform to Paul.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just realized I'm just like
this fucking weird old guy that's like
[SPEAKER_01]: hanging out in bars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even drinking, not even drinking,
but even drinking, smoking weed in the
[SPEAKER_01]: back of fucking bars.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So come out to the open mic night,
you guys, because if you don't,
[SPEAKER_02]: they might not let us keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's that's a real thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we're the only Pueblo open mic and
it's going to go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can't even get like other stuff
going on because we can't get anybody to
[SPEAKER_01]: this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So support local comedy, guys,
because if you don't support things,
[SPEAKER_02]: they go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one day you'll be like,
hey, remember that comedy group?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there won't even fucking exist because
you blew it off for too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: So support the local comedy as to how much
you should be smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm done taking my dad now so I can rant
about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoke until you're comfortably high.
[SPEAKER_02]: There have been days and this sound you
guys are going to think I'm crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There have been days when I've smoked a
gram or two by myself, like started a
[SPEAKER_02]: fresh gram when I woke up, got done with
it, started another gram and finished that
[SPEAKER_02]: one by myself throughout the course of a
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you would think those are days when
I'm sitting around not doing shit,
[SPEAKER_02]: but those are actually the days when I'm
doing the most.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how I do it, but I'll stop
and take four or five fat dads and go
[SPEAKER_02]: right back to work, work for an hour or
two, take four or five more dads,
[SPEAKER_02]: go right back to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, cause you're busy and you got your
mind going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like the high doesn't stick around as
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least like you're using it though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know how at the end of the day,
your back hurts and you're all sore if
[SPEAKER_02]: you've been doing work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get that because I've been dabbing
all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like my body doesn't even, my muscles stay
loose and relaxed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I guess it's like going and
taking a leave, you know, instead of
[SPEAKER_02]: taking a leave or Tylenol or Prick of
whatevers, I'm just taking a few dabs and
[SPEAKER_02]: keeping the pain away all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it kind of, the dabs make my head,
I talk about, I prefer Indica flowers and
[SPEAKER_02]: sativa dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dabs make my head go really fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I take the alpha brain, take two dabs and
drink a little bit of caffeine and bro,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can work for 12 hours straight without a
break.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quit picking at your skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what that was.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you started saying I can work for
like 12 hours state and then you started
[SPEAKER_01]: picking at your skin and said,
Jeff, what else are you doing in them
[SPEAKER_01]: dabs, brother?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I ate a donut earlier and apparently
part of the frosting was stuck to my arm
[SPEAKER_02]: hair.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I pulled on it, it really hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God, you're such a wuss.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you pull on your arm hair,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pull some of that shit out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's not a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're cooler than me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just so high I couldn't feel my arm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a donut frosting dingleberry in my
arm hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like donut frosting dingleberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my arm hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I just like the donut frosting
dingleberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that you consider that for the name
of this episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody will listen if we do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I warned them immediately when they were
coming on.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're still with us, you guys are
soldiers, not soldier on.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else we got?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, holy crap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys don't smoke as much as Clint did,
but smoke as much as I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's funny because that's a good
example.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've probably consumed since Clint's been
here, five dabs, I'm going to guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four or five dabs at least since Clint's
been here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two puffs off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two puffs off of that bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course I've been smoking throughout
the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's seven o'clock almost, so I've
probably had 12 dabs by now today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and I smoked nothing all day today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Clint is ruined.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to let Clint drive for at
least another hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I could pass any sobriety test that
you needed me to right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm not even being a smart ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am going to burp.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I really could pass almost any
sobriety test you offered me at this
[SPEAKER_02]: point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about your body chemistry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you're used to being, where you're
trying to be with your eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long your dreadlocks are.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long your dreadlocks are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's funny, dude, because I've seen
some people with dreads try to be cool and
[SPEAKER_02]: they can't keep up at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: They think because they got the dreads,
they're going to be able to party with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a half gram dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see who you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to carry him to the couch.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody asked me- Pull him by his
dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drag him by the dreads right to the couch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drag him out in the front yard with the
sprinklers on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody also sent me a message about trim
machines.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, how do you feel about trim
machines?
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, you're going to think I'm a
prick, but fuck a trim machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: A trim machine ruins your trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes a messier buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: High grade top shelf cannabis is hand
trimmed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trim machines don't have fingers or eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't put in love.
[SPEAKER_02]: They mangle the buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if you've got a nice bud and you
run it through a trim machine,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not going to take off all the leaf in
one spot and it will take off some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: bud in some spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is from experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've helped other people use trim
machines.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use the Spin Pro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen the Grim or the Trim Reaper.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen the Tsunami thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like the way any of them work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, what it does is it turns your trim
into a mulch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It chops it up into this really funky
mulch and then it almost creates too many
[SPEAKER_02]: cuts so that the moisture seeps out of the
leaves or the trim in a weird way and
[SPEAKER_02]: it'll mold up.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's almost no way to prevent that shit
from turning moldy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like to hand trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: That way you can separate the big leaves
from the good trim and you can know what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're making hash with and nobody's going
to trim it like a person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like at the dispensaries, they've got a
whole crew of trimmers that hand trim
[SPEAKER_02]: everything and they don't go as quickly as
a trimmer, but I think it's well worth it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a whole bunch of like 22 to 28 year
old people.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just want to trim all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're eager to get into the cannabis
business and they just want to trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they just kick ass all day in hopes of
getting promoted to a bud tender or a
[SPEAKER_02]: grower and that's who does the trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rather have those six or eight people
sitting around trimming all day every day
[SPEAKER_02]: than two trim machines running,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So fucking auto trimmer, fuck a trim
machine, trim it by hand, use some
[SPEAKER_01]: scissors, use your eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got fucking carpal tunnel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I've got carpal tunnel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got thumb calluses.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got four finger calluses.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got wrist sores just from trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just from my Xbox, just from my Xbox.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably trimmed a hundred pounds of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know more than a hundred pounds of
weed in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure I've trimmed more than a
hundred pounds by myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, there was a second half to that
question that somebody emailed to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second half of that question is kind
of lengthy and I'm going to have to do
[SPEAKER_02]: some research and give you a more thought
out answer for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not prepare enough time for that
answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really good question and I will get
back to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not blowing it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just, I want to be accurate and a
little more in depth for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that is a hell of a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you know, it'd be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, if you, if you put out the call or
like if maybe somebody like that listens
[SPEAKER_01]: as a friend that has like a really great
weed story from like the seventies,
[SPEAKER_01]: do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, like one of those, like we had to
get away from the cops kind of things,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, and, and how, how, how great it is
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want me to get some chongs on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Kinda.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually his medical marijuana
provider and he's an old cat and he loves
[SPEAKER_02]: to tell me stories, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I had him on the podcast one time on seven
one nine, the blocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember that when we put on the
headphones on him and put the microphone
[SPEAKER_02]: in front of him, something lit up inside
of him and his voice turned into like
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he got all spectacular and
charismatic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the end of the show, I was like,
dude, have you done this before?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes, I did college radio,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's nothing fucking like it,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, yeah, this is college
radio, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's, it's our, it's a digital
college radio now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we got our like cult little
followers and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, and I'm sure that's not for me,
but I mean, that's I'm here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So suck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every guest, even though you're a Dick,
every guest that comes on brings their own
[SPEAKER_02]: audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you'll, you'll retweet my tweet that
you're on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I tweet that, Hey,
tall Clint was on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe one of your three Twitter followers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, you know, but maybe if you have 10,
maybe two of them, we'll check out the
[SPEAKER_02]: show and one of them will probably like
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll get another listener and then we
can bring Sam Talon on and then,
[SPEAKER_01]: and both cross paths.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I really want everybody to hear Sam
Talon.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's really funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'll get him on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Invite him, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll be on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell him to come down pretty early.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll record 30 minutes and we'll put it
out as one of those Thursday episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys for listening, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank you guys all.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just talking about our fans and our
little cult following.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really inspired me to say thank you
because I haven't said that enough lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been caught up in putting out a show
and keeping the guests entertained and
[SPEAKER_02]: keeping the flow happening to our having
sincerely said, Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get so many downloads, so many listens,
the website traffic, I had to pay for more
[SPEAKER_02]: bandwidth on my website because you guys
are killing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Downloading episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The traffic on the website is exploding.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to fix the file type that I upload
so that it's more available for Stitcher
[SPEAKER_02]: because people were downloading it so much
that it was slowing down the Stitcher
[SPEAKER_02]: application on their phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I changed the file, the type of file
that I upload.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't sound as good, but nobody's
probably going to notice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a voice podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like we're putting out freaking
dance music or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So but yeah, people are listening and I
really, really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've told a friend, we really
appreciate that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told Drew and Dustin about this because
I was like, no, I was really funny on this
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I was really funny back like,
jeez, I've been on this thing like eight
[SPEAKER_01]: times or something stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that you crashed the intro to.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just doing this podcast is fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is great, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You look comfortable.
[SPEAKER_02]: You finally got your head bobbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're loving it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I just, uh, it is nice, but it's nice
to tell one friend and then they tell one
[SPEAKER_01]: friend and then they tell one friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all I'm asking is tell your
friend about, uh, Sam Talent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell your friends about, uh, broadcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Sam Talent podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, Sam Talent's coming down to do the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to get people out to that show,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so fucking, it's so ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Life is on the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys don't go to the show,
his life is going to fall apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll just suck.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, let's see, do I have any more
notes that I want to talk about on today's
[SPEAKER_02]: episode?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we can almost, uh, if you want to
fucking ramble on about something for a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of minutes, man, what's your,
uh, how long, how long have we done now?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've gone 33 minutes, but I imagine that
one to three minutes will be taken out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got about 30 minutes of usable
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a, there was a depressing part
in there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that does not make the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll make you look dignified before this
comes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be really funny if like just during
that part, you go, Clint wants you to come
[SPEAKER_01]: out to your, to the, to the show and like,
you just edit that in just a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: mumbles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, yeah, please come to the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please come to Clint's show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will apologize for this air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's making a whole bunch of damn noise
over my shoulder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try to take that out of the
recording, but I can hear it just going
[SPEAKER_02]: click, click, click, click, click in my
head.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's driving the producer in me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely bonkers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fucking rad, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you got such a talent for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah, I've been doing, this is my 78th
episode on this show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I did about 50 on another show.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've had a little bit of practice and,
uh, I think I finally got it figured out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Took a minute, but thanks for noticing
the, uh, the improvements that I've done.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people have actually said that
they've gone back and listened from
[SPEAKER_02]: episode number one up to whatever the
current episode is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of me makes my, it makes me hang
my head in shame.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, Oh, you heard episodes one through
five where I was like, not sure what I was
[SPEAKER_02]: doing at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, but then I'm like, Oh,
but that means you also heard 75 where I
[SPEAKER_02]: knew everything that I was doing by now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know everything about a
podcast, but I feel like I can come on
[SPEAKER_02]: here and do a show now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know before it would take me three
hours worth of getting stuff together and
[SPEAKER_02]: being nervous and three different takes of
putting a show together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I'm just like, what a podcast
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's kill it.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, that's fucking cool, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's neat then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll bet those people that have
listened to all of them, like feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: they know you pretty well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and it's fun meeting those people
because some people come out of nowhere
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're like, dude, you're rusted.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll hear my voice at the grow store.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody was like, you're that guy on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, yeah, man, how'd you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, I can recognize your
voice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, that's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to meet you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I hang out with those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go to their house and take dabs and
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but like, that's kind of what I'm
saying is if you, if you listen,
[SPEAKER_01]: let us know, dude, we're just human.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all over Colorado, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I travel all over Colorado and I'll hang
out and take dabs with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not afraid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not worried.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're listening to the show,
you're good people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not taking dabs with anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, Clint.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're all heathens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint will come with me and he'll not take
dabs and he'll sit there and stare at you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Judgmentally.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be like your dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd be looking at me like, God damn it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish that we hadn't brought Jeff's dad
and some dark glasses, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can just be my security guard.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's security.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just need a mustache.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a mustache.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the hair for the seventies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I could plan that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't going to mention your feathered
seventies hair.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you filming porn when you leave here?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a couple of things going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since we're way, way off topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would be your porn name?
[SPEAKER_01]: Peter Frampton.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that's available.
[SPEAKER_02]: This screen name is not available.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be fucking fun though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peter Frampton underscore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spell the word underscore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nah, I was thinking about it and I was
like, no, because then that's a pain in
[SPEAKER_01]: the ass and then you can't get the Twitter
handle because it's too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peter Frampton underscore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like I do?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do what I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like fucking Peter Frampton though.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet it sells some porns too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next one I'm Brett Michaels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Frampton comes alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, see you got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're winning.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to wrap up this show here
really soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost seven 10 in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to the wild cousins.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to Clint for coming on the
show and getting way too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the answer to your question is
just don't get too high and do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be recorded while you're super high
because you may say some shit that you
[SPEAKER_02]: regret.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to regret any of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully your friend is the producer and
he'll take all of it out for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I'm going to regret
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't say anything stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I've been doing this thing called
Periscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Periscope is an app that you can get on
your phone, either your iPhone or your
[SPEAKER_02]: Android device.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just go download Periscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what you could do is follow me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm at Rasta Jeff 420 on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Occasionally, more than occasionally,
at least once maybe twice a day,
[SPEAKER_02]: I jump on Periscope and I will do a live
video where I sit here in the recording
[SPEAKER_02]: area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I take big fat dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I take my morning dabs or my
afternoon dabs, whatever the first puff
[SPEAKER_02]: session of the day is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get on Periscope, take a few dabs
with you guys, talk a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: wisdom, drop some knowledge on you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll answer a few questions if you type it
in the question box.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once I get good at recording the show,
setting the phone here in front of the
[SPEAKER_02]: computer, getting on Periscope and
forgetting that Periscope is going and
[SPEAKER_02]: still paying attention to the chat in
Periscope, I will start doing a live show
[SPEAKER_02]: on Periscope as I record.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys that are on Periscope with me
will be able to ask me questions live and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be able to read them on the screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will read the question aloud into the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll be like, so Tal Clint says,
how come you don't ever brush your hair?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll answer the question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I hear that so much on Periscope?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of trolls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm troll-proof, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have not just said that on the
podcast because now they want to challenge
[SPEAKER_02]: my troll game.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I am troll-proof on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my page.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I'm dirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I got dreadlocks, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to fucking make me cry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's the thing is nobody's ever
said anything original anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always like, oh, I heard that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's tough about comedy too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's a lot of jokes that have
been done.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we're just trying to do new
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But troll-proof is fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Troll-proof.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should make a screen name or something
that's troll-proof because I feel like I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: troll-proof.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a grown ass man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a little kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm quite secure with myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do troll-proof on Periscope right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just type it in as the thing and then have
everybody just say mean things at you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not on the show though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'll do that right after.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you guys check me out on
Periscope once in a while though,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I come on late at night,
early in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Random times, just take fat dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on a really weird schedule being
employed and self-employed and being a
[SPEAKER_02]: producer of a show.
[SPEAKER_02]: My hours are really random.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go to bed around four in the morning and
get up around somewhere between nine and
[SPEAKER_02]: 10, sometimes 11 if I'm lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sun comes up and I just start getting
up and doing shit, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the way it's got to be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you got to hustle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quite often I'm up by nine o'clock because
some of the grow lights come on at nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit, sometimes I got to be at the spot by
eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit, I got to get a fucking job,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This shit sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint had a great comedy set.
[SPEAKER_02]: One day Clint got relieved of his position
at his spot of employment and then we
[SPEAKER_02]: drove up and watched him do comedy and
that comedy set was quite awkward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt like I was the wife that was about
to get beat because you were the husband
[SPEAKER_02]: that lost his job.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was pretty mad that day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could tell, but we were doing everything
we could to put you in a better head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah, you guys did good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You look like you're in a much better
space than like 40 minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we're just ... No, everybody's all in
this all together, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's happening for a reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the damn truth, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we're going to wrap up this
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been rambling for 40 minutes.
Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We warned you immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: I warned you immediately too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he did.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't warn me as the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: He all got the warning at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff got the brunt of this one because you
guys had the opportunity to not listen to
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to edit some of this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, he's going to have to listen to this
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Twice, because I'll listen to it as I edit
it and then when it's complete,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give it one full complete listen
through just to make sure it's- Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: it doesn't sound shitty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I didn't do any hard P's or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even fix the hard P's and S's.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the software does most of that for
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought good shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying that's cool that you're
getting help.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I got this piece over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got this piece over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my daughter calling me, so- Oh,
you want me to turn down your mic?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that him?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to wrap up the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint's got to step away for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect timing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to find the paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, now the show's over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to iTunes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Search for the Grow From Your Heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find the review section.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me a five-star rating.
[SPEAKER_02]: After that, type in a comment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me know what you think of the show and
I will read your comment on a future
[SPEAKER_02]: episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can leave a comment on Stitcher if
you'd like, but it's really hard to find
[SPEAKER_02]: the comments.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will go and look, but Stitcher is really
weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find me on all the social media sites,
please.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's at Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's at GFYH podcast, or it's just at
GFYH.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's at GFYH podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Follow iRegenetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't forget that the show's available on
iTunes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stitcher and every single episode is
archived on iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint has jumped back on the microphone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is everything cool, brother?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, everything's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just when your daughter calls,
you answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got one myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been bragging about her birthday on
the past couple of episodes, and if she
[SPEAKER_02]: called right now, we would talk to her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a nine-year-old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what dads do, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we're supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Answer when the girl calls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate all your fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything, but that's the one thing
that's going to stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not many things that we stopped recording
for, but the daughters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aren't they great?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're actually good people, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a fucking dirty hippie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a foul-mouthed sailor of a,
like, person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the analogy I was going for
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: A comedian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that guy's a dick.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the little ones first, bro,
because that's... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to make this... Can you edit out
all the fucks?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the day, I did what was called the
dollar fuck jar, and the money got donated
[SPEAKER_02]: to somebody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, the money is sitting somewhere,
and that dude has not contacted me,
[SPEAKER_02]: so he doesn't listen to the show anymore,
so my fault.
[SPEAKER_02]: But speaking of money, there's a donation
button on the podcast page.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go to the website, it's
ireadgeneticscolorado.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Click on the Grow From Your Heart podcast
tab.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the top right, there's a donation
button, a little PayPal logo.
[SPEAKER_02]: That goes directly to my PayPal account.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, I'm not begging you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just letting you know it's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The podcast is always going to be free.
[SPEAKER_02]: This comes to you from me as a gift,
because I love you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want you to grow better cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to break the stigma and fears
associated with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to help out the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to free the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is all free, but if you do feel
like making a contribution, I would love
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd give you a shout out on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just go to the website.
[SPEAKER_02]: Click on the PayPal thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Throw in however much you feel like you'd
like to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not begging, but it's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, run all the social media
sites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clint, thanks for coming, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was fun, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll bet your fans fucking hate me now.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they're only going to get like 30
minutes of your ear bashing, so it'll be
[SPEAKER_02]: okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was brutal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, thanks for tolerating Clint.
