[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time for episode 426 of the grow
from your heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode of the show is brought to you
by my friends at Oregon elite seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time to add fresh new genetics to
your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been growing that same old shit for
way too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's tired of that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to update your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need some fresh new varieties in your
grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're ready for new feminized or
regular seeds, I highly recommend Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: elite seeds and you can find them at www
.organeliteseeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen to the podcast a lot,
you know I like to start the show off by
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been dabbing on Larry OG
Ambrosia from our friends at Apothecary
[SPEAKER_00]: Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is labeled as Indica dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency label says this contains 68.8%
THC and 82.3% total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to crack it open and give it a
fresh smell so I can describe it properly
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I should mention is the
appearance and texture of this concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a perfect amount of chunky
diamonds and a beautiful amount of saucy
[SPEAKER_00]: turp sauce in this container.
[SPEAKER_00]: The color is the perfect golden color that
I expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The turps are not too runny.
[SPEAKER_00]: The crystals are not too big or too small.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really approve of the consistency of
this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great batch of concentrate here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give it a smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I opened it up for.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the first smell, you get some gas with
the background of pine and then as it sits
[SPEAKER_00]: on your nose and you let it sit by your
face for a little bit, it starts kicking
[SPEAKER_00]: in a little bit of a skunky aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do enjoy that type of a
concentrate, that type of flavor and
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma, that classic OG Kush, kind of a
skunky, earthy sort of a thing going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a really great aroma and flavor
coming from this product, but again,
[SPEAKER_00]: what I really like is the size of the
chunky diamonds and the amount of diamonds
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the amount of turp sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens in a lot of saucy,
live resin, Ambrosia, there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different names for these types of
products, but what happens to a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: these products is sometimes you'll get a
really big diamond and a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: turp sauce in there or sometimes you'll
get a whole bunch of turp sauce and very
[SPEAKER_00]: little diamonds in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's hard to work with something
that is all turp sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really get it on the dab or you
can't take a satisfying dab of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they give you a giant boulder of
the diamonds in the middle and barely any
[SPEAKER_00]: turp sauce and you need some of the turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like the diamonds the most because
that's the potency, but I think the turps
[SPEAKER_00]: are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without the turps, it's not the same,
so I really like it when there's a good
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio and these guys did a very good job
at the ratio of turp sauce to diamonds and
[SPEAKER_00]: the diamonds aren't too big or too small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really great consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been one of my favorite
concentrates that I've gotten most
[SPEAKER_00]: recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out once again to our friends
at Apothecary Farms for the Larry OG
[SPEAKER_00]: Indica Dominant Ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of words for a product,
but that is the strain name and that of
[SPEAKER_00]: course the Ambrosia is their proprietary
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check it out, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you tell them Rasta Jeff sent
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, in this episode I'm going to
read a couple of iTunes customer reviews
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe a couple of emails if we get
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get to that part, let's give a
few shout outs to our friends from
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge Grow From Your Heart
podcast shout out to my friend Isaac.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, a Grow From Your Heart podcast
shout out to our buddy Tommy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always a big shout out to our buddy Keith
K.

[SPEAKER_00]: the past, in the present and in the

[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the start of the show, I said I was
going to read some iTunes customer ratings
[SPEAKER_00]: and reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get right into that part of the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to leave a review on
iTunes, it is really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were listening on an Apple device
such as an iPhone or an iPad, it is really
[SPEAKER_00]: easy to leave a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the podcast app just like you want
to listen to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on the show just like you're going
to listen to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you will see a list of available
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scroll right past the available episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will say best of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it will say ratings and reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives you the option to tap to rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the option of one through five
stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me as many stars as you feel I
deserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then right underneath there is a tab that
says write a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where you were able to write a
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And share your opinion of the podcast with
the Apple iTunes community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are listening on an Apple
device, I encourage you to please leave a
[SPEAKER_00]: review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into the reviews for this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first iTunes customer rating and
review for this episode was left on,
[SPEAKER_00]: where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: April 18th, 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was left by somebody who calls
themselves BananaBoy53.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline says easy to digest
information and they gave us a five star
[SPEAKER_00]: rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: The customer review goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this guy is not yet a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: He plans to grow in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's listening to the show to get his
prerequisites under his belt so that when
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes time to grow some plants,
he actually has a solid foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really do enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says he likes listening to my buddies
and I sit around and bullshit,
[SPEAKER_00]: which that's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad people are enjoying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he enjoys the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hitting my target.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love knowing that I'm hitting my target.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm reaching my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for that great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he goes on to say, keep up the great
work and shout out to White Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, White Mike, you got another shout
out, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means you need to come be on the show
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, BananaBoy53.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, thank you for the five star
rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into the next review.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says got to meet Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave us a five star rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is from our friend Casey Benny.
[SPEAKER_00]: They left it on April 18th.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the review goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go by the name of Casey Benny and a
recent astrological phenomenon seems to
[SPEAKER_00]: have lined everything up to make it
possible for me to not only come to Denver
[SPEAKER_00]: for the first time in my life,
but I was also able to attend the fabled
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude Grows Cup and meet Rasta Jeff there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I'm so glad you made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome that you think it was an
astrological phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's just fate and the way things
were supposed to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you made it to the Dude Grows
Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know what the Dude Grows Cup
was, there's another podcast that I
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage you to listen to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is called the Dude Grows Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is hosted by a guy known as the Dude,
also hosted by his buddy named Scotty
[SPEAKER_00]: Real.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a producer named Guru who does
a wonderful job.
[SPEAKER_00]: He contributes heavily to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a great podcast with a very
loyal following, as do I.
[SPEAKER_00]: They threw an event in Denver that was
called the Dude Grows Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of a community based grow off
kind of an event where a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: came together from all over the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to show off our products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to enjoy each other's company.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to educate each other and mainly
just hang out and smoke down and enjoy the
[SPEAKER_00]: community that has been created around the
Dude Grows Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what the Dude Grows Cup was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friend was able to come out and hang
out and he got to meet me there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's more to this review.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says Rasta Jeff was the coolest vendor
at the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that means a lot to me, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did have kind of a party going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: at my booth the entire time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got a little bit crowded over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say it seemed that the other
seed vendors were not priced with love.
[SPEAKER_00]: My man Jeff hooked me up with five packs
of seeds for the price of one pack from
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the other guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one pack was a 10 pack because he was
out of five packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually remember this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave you a 10 pack of Hellfire OG
because I'd ran out of five packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, many of the seed companies there are
higher priced than my self.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a attack at anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: My seed packs are more friendly priced
than many of the other seed companies out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll also notice that I've got a smaller
crew than everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got more people to pay for.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got more stuff to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep my overhead small.
[SPEAKER_00]: That allows me to keep my pricing down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I want everybody to have access to
quality seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of why I started breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of why I started putting seeds out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them to be affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason why everybody shouldn't
be able to afford quality seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I offer is a quality seed
at an affordable price.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just as good as the other expensive
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just everybody can afford it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to feel like you're
breaking the bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to feel like you're going
to go broke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dig in too deep into your pockets to get
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do appreciate it that you notice that
my stuff is a little bit more affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, you asked for a five pack of
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have a fiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to make sure you got the seeds
you needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I gave you a 10 for the price of a
five.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we could do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to take care of the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say they all had more than
five in the packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's also something I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to put six or seven seeds in the
five packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 10 packs will have 12 to 14 seeds in
them quite often.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how I do it when I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on to say it was so cool to meet
Jeff and the Cup was the best party I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been to since my wedding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, my friend, I remember you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember this interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great meeting you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to seeing you at the next
Dude Grows Cup event, which will be on 713
[SPEAKER_00]: at Cultivated Synergy, the same exact
place where we had the last event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a lot of details and a lot of
information right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is still being put together and
still being worked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is another Dude Grows 710 event
on 713 at Cultivated Synergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will keep you updated as often as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want up to date information,
I suggest listening to the Dude Grows
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel no sense of competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all a community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want everybody to grow the highest
quality cannabis that they can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can get more information by
listening to the Dude and Scotty and Guru,
[SPEAKER_00]: why not do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So listen to my friends, the Dude Grows
podcast, and join us at the Dude Grows 710
[SPEAKER_00]: event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Casey, Benny, thanks again for the great
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, thank you for the five
stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, bro, I look forward to seeing
you in July.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another review.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline for this one says Rasta Jeff
and the Airy Army kicks butt.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave us five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is from a person who calls
themselves Daddy Yo 45.
[SPEAKER_00]: They left this review on April 29th.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the review goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one kick butt show on auto
flowering and moving plants back and forth
[SPEAKER_00]: from indoors and outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of good information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's talking about a recent episode I
did where I talked about moving plants
[SPEAKER_00]: from an indoor grow room, putting them
outdoors to get some sunshine and bringing
[SPEAKER_00]: them back in at the end of the day to keep
them in a flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of recommended not to do that
because of the simple fact of bringing
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs into the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what they're referring to there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I could put a smile on your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be too scared when I read your email
on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes people get tripped out because
they put their name or whatever in the
[SPEAKER_00]: email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I say anything about you or anything on
the show, the only people listening are
[SPEAKER_00]: fellow growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not going to know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my friend Bill has this grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many Bills on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know it's you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way that people are going to know
it's you is if you make a big deal out of
[SPEAKER_00]: it and snitch on yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I ever say your name on the show,
if I ever say your nickname on the show
[SPEAKER_00]: because of an email or something,
don't get too paranoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the only one that knows and it's
supposed to be for you anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the one that feels the pride inside
because I said your name, like Sour D.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know who Sour D is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know who Keith K is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Keith K, he knows who he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave him a shout out at the start of the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keith K knows exactly who he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are thousands of Keith K's out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are looking over at their
buddy Keith going, is that you,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going, it wasn't me,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the one that it was, he's excited
inside and he feels it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't ever feel weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ever feel nervous if I give you a
shout out or say your name on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knows but you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm rambly as shit today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to blame that on our friend
Caffeine and also Larry Oakley.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to blame that on our friend
Caffeine and also Larry Oakley.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, there is one more review on the
screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was left on May 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline is so awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, they gave us a five star
rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is from a person who calls
themselves, how do you say that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Morgan Lucci, Morgan Lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how to say that, but I do
appreciate the great review because it
[SPEAKER_00]: goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo man, I just started listening to your
show about two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, welcome aboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it goes to say, I started from the
beginning and I'm already on episode 107.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, you have got a lot to go and it's
kind of embarrassing when people go listen
[SPEAKER_00]: to that old shit, but I'm glad you're
listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you're getting a solid
foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see that my growth style
and my approach to growing and my attitude
[SPEAKER_00]: about some methods and techniques will
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to change as things
evolve, but you will see me evolve and
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So join me on that journey and thank you
for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I'm sure you're probably up to 200 by
now since this was a few days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, this show rocks and I
appreciate you sharing your wisdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will most definitely take a dab and give
my mom a hug for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you feel that the show rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I'm helping you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are very welcome for sharing the
wisdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I would be cheating or doing
the world some sort of disservice or being
[SPEAKER_00]: selfish if I didn't share all of the
things that I have gathered and learned
[SPEAKER_00]: along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for noticing and you're very
welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says, I'll definitely take a dab
and give my mom a hug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's following all the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy's doing it perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: He ends it out with cheers, mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody for the great
iTunes customer reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, everybody left us a five star
rating, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if you would like to leave an
iTunes customer review, it is really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply open up your Apple device,
either your iPhone or your iPad,
[SPEAKER_00]: go to the podcast application.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not already subscribed,
all you have to do is search for the Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: From Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click subscribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will show you the available episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scroll right past the available episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will give you the option to leave the
amount of stars which you feel I deserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on the amount of stars you feel is
fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then right underneath that is the tab to
click write a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where you can write a review and I
will read your review on a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to hearing from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, that is all the
iTunes customer reviews for today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move into a quick email.
[SPEAKER_00]: This email comes from our friend Ryan and
Ryan ended his email with thanks Ryan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a first name bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that I can say your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not gonna freak anybody out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This email goes a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Jeff, I love your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks for listening, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, can I vacuum seal my nugs
after they get to the desired ripeness in
[SPEAKER_00]: the jar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you can absolutely vacuum seal your
nugs once they have reached the desired
[SPEAKER_00]: ripeness in your jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure they are actually the
ripeness you want them to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do seal them up and there's too
much moisture in there, you do run the
[SPEAKER_00]: risk of creating a mold problem inside of
that container.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you are a smart man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you know how far to take
them before you seal them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as you get them to the correct
ripeness, as long as you get them to the
[SPEAKER_00]: correct moisture level before you seal
them up, yes, you can absolutely vacuum
[SPEAKER_00]: seal your product so that your nugs stay
nice and fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're anything like me, you'll
probably write the strain name and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll probably weigh that product before
you vacuum seal it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll be able to write the strain
name, the amount of product and the date
[SPEAKER_00]: that it was sealed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you have a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of details on that product
because you probably, if you're vacuum
[SPEAKER_00]: sealing shit, you've probably got quite a
stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have several things stashed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, you can absolutely vacuum seal
your nugs, but make sure to label them so
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't forget what it is because we
are, again, cannabis consumers and we like
[SPEAKER_00]: to forget a lot of small details.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, podcast world, that is all I've
got for you for this quick Thursday
[SPEAKER_00]: episode of the Grow From Your Heart
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you again for listening.
