[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for episode number 81 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, if you're a new grower,
if you're a professional grower,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're a new smoker or a veteran
dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or
[SPEAKER_01]: even someone who's just curious about the
current state of cannabis, this,
[SPEAKER_01]: my friends, is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I want to send a huge thank you
shout out to the Mystic Roots band for
[SPEAKER_01]: letting me use their music on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks to Kat, Coop, and the entire
Mystic Roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's everybody doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the first of the month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get too far into the show,
let me give you guys a warning.
[SPEAKER_01]: There may be some loud pops and sizzles in
the background here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the 1st of July.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody is getting prepared for the 4th
of July.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that music was loud, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the 1st of July as we record.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody in my neighborhood is already
begun celebrating the 4th of July.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll hear some M-80s, some mortars go
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll hear some, all kinds of great shit
happening in the background here as we
[SPEAKER_01]: record.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been scaring the shit out of me for
the past couple of hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep forgetting that it's right near the
4th of July and I keep hearing these loud
[SPEAKER_01]: booms and I want to get up and go look.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time I think, I'm going to go
look, I realize that's just damn
[SPEAKER_01]: fireworks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at least I hope it's fireworks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of live in not the best
neighborhood in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like this time of year because then
you can just really convince yourself that
[SPEAKER_01]: that boom was fireworks this one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So guys, thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy first of the month.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will probably come out on Monday.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that'll be, fuck, I won't even know the
date.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be Monday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy Monday as you listen to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get too far, this podcast is
brought to you by my good friends at Hygro
[SPEAKER_01]: Indoor Growing Supplies.

[SPEAKER_01]: Let them know that you listen to Rasta
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll really help them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me also mention before we go too far,
I am on Periscope once again.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an application called Periscope
where we can record everything live.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm broadcasting live to, there are 10
people watching me right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be hopefully a few more by the
end of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ever want to watch me on Periscope,
I kind of record randomly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't set a good schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to set a schedule so
that I can get you guys on Periscope with
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll start making a date of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now to the people that are on
Periscope watching, you guys, I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to pay attention to the comments
until toward the end of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to record about a 20 minute show
and then I'll open it up for questions and
[SPEAKER_01]: I will accept questions from my viewers
that are on Periscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to have to make this a
regular thing so that I can schedule this
[SPEAKER_01]: so that my friends and fans can get on
here and listen at the proper time and
[SPEAKER_01]: watch me on Periscope and interact.
[SPEAKER_01]: But tonight, this is kind of my test run.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to advertise that I was
going to do this because I didn't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: get bombarded and get overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of this podcast,
once I do my news articles and talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: the email I received, I will open up the
floor for questions from my Periscope
[SPEAKER_01]: viewers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me keep the show going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much respect to the sponsors, to Hydro and
or Growing Supplies for making the show
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do help me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are interested in sponsoring the
show, send me an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get you all of the information that
you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, where do we want to start?
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the first of the month.
[SPEAKER_01]: I already mentioned that and I talked
about the fireworks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked about Periscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since it's the first of the month,
let's jump right into this news article.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today is the first of the month and it is
also the first day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me just read the article to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, Oregon opens door to legal pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Retail sales still in the works.
[SPEAKER_01]: This article is by Jeff Bernard from the
Associated Press.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, I found it on The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to our friends at The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The article says, Williams, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: 42 years after Oregon became the first
state to decriminalize small amounts of
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana, the state is taking its first
steps along a road leading to state
[SPEAKER_01]: licensed stores selling limited amounts of
it to anyone over 21.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon has long been a pioneer on sensible
marijuana policy, said Anthony Johnson,
[SPEAKER_01]: chief pioneer on Measure 91, which on
Wednesday makes Oregon the fourth state to
[SPEAKER_01]: adopt laws legalizing recreational use of
cannabis for people old enough to drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, July 1st, 2015, the state of Oregon
has legalized recreational cannabis for
[SPEAKER_01]: folks 21 and over.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's all celebrate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't taken a dab on the show lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is grounds to take a
celebration dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So join me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give you guys a couple
seconds to get a dab ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do a medium sized dab here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not one of those big fat dabs I like to do
because I don't want to be choking on the
[SPEAKER_01]: show here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a show to run.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this dab I'm going to take is in
celebration of all of my friends in Oregon
[SPEAKER_01]: who can now smoke and possess recreational
cannabis without worry of arrest,
[SPEAKER_01]: without any sort of trouble from the
police.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do a dab for you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're on Periscope, do a dab with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're listening to the podcast,
do a dab with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Join me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the Garden of Weeden for
delicious dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anthony Johnson added, though he doesn't
expect much increased demand for it,
[SPEAKER_01]: he means for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he goes on to say, smoking it in
public is illegal, but in Portland,
[SPEAKER_01]: police are discouraging residents from
calling 911 to report pot smokers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Portland chapter of National
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: Laws posted on its website that it would
have a tent set up at the west side of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Burnside Bridge for a midnight countdown
to the end of marijuana prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: The site offers a big neon sign in the
shape of Oregon as a background for
[SPEAKER_01]: selfies of revelers who light up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I could just imagine that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, a big ass sign shaped like
Oregon with people just dabbing out and
[SPEAKER_01]: puffing down in front of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll continue with the article.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, adults will be allowed to possess
up to a half a pound and grow four plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: but not yet to buy or sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be a few months to more than a
year before it is legal to sell and then
[SPEAKER_01]: only with a state permit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now it says adults will be
allowed to possess up to a pound and
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll be allowed to grow up to four
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about the last episode,
that pound or that half a pound,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, that half a pound has to stay
at home and you're allowed to carry up to
[SPEAKER_01]: one ounce with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just in case you were confused,
Oregon issued a nice little statement that
[SPEAKER_01]: showed you that one ounce of cannabis is
approximately the size of one Voodoo
[SPEAKER_01]: donut.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how much you're allowed to carry
around with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the article goes on to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I stumbled over that word,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: A state regulated retail system is not
expected to be fully up and running until
[SPEAKER_01]: late next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growers are expected to be able to start
applying for licenses in January with
[SPEAKER_01]: permits for processors, wholesalers and
retailers rolling out in succession.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growers are already gearing up,
particularly in Southern Oregon,
[SPEAKER_01]: long known as a prime climate for outdoor
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jackson County building services director,
Kelly Matting said they have received 17
[SPEAKER_01]: complaints over the past six months of
marijuana growers violating land use laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, if you're gonna grow cannabis and
you're gonna do it out in somebody's land
[SPEAKER_01]: or out in some land, be aware of what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be mindful of what you're destroying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go fucking bulldoze a lake.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do that kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't cut down a bunch of trees
ridiculously and irresponsibly,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially on somebody else's land.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay attention to what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your profit and your cannabis crop comes
second to our environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, with the legalization of
recreational marijuana, I think that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing a move to our area by people who
may be from out of state, out of the area
[SPEAKER_01]: who don't really know or understand our
land use laws and our environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: protection, she said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once a month, veteran medical marijuana
growers and hopeful newbies gather in the
[SPEAKER_01]: old Grange Hall in the community of
Williams to hear the latest updates on the
[SPEAKER_01]: legislature's process on framing
regulations and tips on how to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy, happy marijuana plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really hostile business
environment, but things are improving,
[SPEAKER_01]: said Cedar Gray, the Grower's Guild
president and a local home builder who
[SPEAKER_01]: along with his wife grow medical marijuana
and hope to move into growing for retail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today is the first day, but you cannot
buy it in a store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be a year before you're
able to buy cannabis in a store,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're able to grow it and it looks
like you're able to give it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out to Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm proud of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the fourth state to have
recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are on our way, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are only so many states left and
they can't all fight us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that takes me to another thing I wanted
to read.
[SPEAKER_01]: This kind of drags me over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I had it open on the computer here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just find it again, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody sent me an email and I answered
half of their question on a previous
[SPEAKER_01]: episode, but I wasn't able to answer the
full question because I hadn't had time to
[SPEAKER_01]: think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I've had time to think about it
and Mike and I brainstormed on this a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to read part of the question
because I've already answered part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: question on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this question says, dude,
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for saying that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is really kind of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for, first of all, loving and
listening to the show and thanks for
[SPEAKER_01]: listening to it while you were in your
garden because I want to promote a good
[SPEAKER_01]: vibe while you're in your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second of all, thanks for respecting my
judgment and noticing that I give out
[SPEAKER_01]: great tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Respect is hard to earn and I appreciate
that you respect me and you've got my
[SPEAKER_01]: respect in turn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your question says, with Oregon about
to turn recreational, I was interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: your opinion on niche business
opportunities and how recreational might
[SPEAKER_01]: affect medical rules and regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I answered the second part of
your question, which was about trim
[SPEAKER_01]: machines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me jump into the one part that I can
answer without a lot of ranting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have some that I wrote down on
the other part.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said how recreational might affect
medical rules and regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me tell you that here in Colorado,
when we rolled out recreational cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: it looks like we have turned our back on
medical marijuana completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've given the finger to the medical
marijuana patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is not me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just how I feel about the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like the industry does not care
about medical marijuana anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more support.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more demand in recreational
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it feels like the medical side in
Colorado is being forgotten and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: almost attempting to eliminate it,
is what it feels like to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's being pushed away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel that the medical rules are going
to affect your area probably very
[SPEAKER_01]: similarly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The growers are going to see more profit
in the recreational side of things and
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll start getting greedy and they'll
stop giving to the patients like they have
[SPEAKER_01]: been.
[SPEAKER_01]: The compassion will go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to start raising prices and
they're going to start selling everything
[SPEAKER_01]: on the commercial side of things instead
of the medical side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I predict.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I have to open up a couple of notes
that I have in my computer here because I
[SPEAKER_01]: wrote a nice list of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other part of your question is what
are niche businesses that I think might
[SPEAKER_01]: open up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe some information or tips about since
Oregon is going recreational.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got a list here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can close.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one, I will be able to open the next
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fighting with my computer while we're
at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So businesses and business opportunities
that will arise with recreational cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: in your area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this will go for everywhere,
not just Oregon where it has just become
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational legally, recreational legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was hard to say, but this will go
along with everywhere where cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: becomes available medically and
recreationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Businesses that I have seen pop up
personally that are attached to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this is not a cannabis related
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say you're not wanting to be in the
dispensary game.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to work at a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to open another business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a nice list of opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Electricians, certified electricians are
getting paid huge money.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're an electrician and you're
willing to work with a dispensary or a
[SPEAKER_01]: grow, you are making huge money right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the first step I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we were able to grow medical cannabis
here in Colorado, everybody built a grow
[SPEAKER_01]: room in their house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody that had a med card.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody on Periscope just made a great
recommendation and that's the next one on
[SPEAKER_01]: my list.
[SPEAKER_01]: So electricians, everyone's going to need
an electrician.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as it goes commercial and
everyone's allowed to grow four,
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep saying commercial, recreational.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as it goes recreational,
everyone's allowed to grow four plants in
[SPEAKER_01]: their house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means everyone's going to want to
build a grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most houses aren't equipped to run a
couple thousand watt lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone's going to need an electrician
and then shit's going to go wrong and
[SPEAKER_01]: people are going to want to up grade so
more electricians all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Following electricians would be HVAC
technicians.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the dispensaries have super fancy,
super high tech HVAC systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could design state of the art HVAC
systems for grow facilities and or
[SPEAKER_01]: residential grows, that would be very
useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also construction crews that are familiar
with grow room construction.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you had a crew that knew how to build a
grow room, if you're a consultant and you
[SPEAKER_01]: can design a nice grow room and you can
have a construction crew that knows what
[SPEAKER_01]: the goal is on building a grow room,
that would be super helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So HVAC electricians and construction
crews to design and build dispensary grows
[SPEAKER_01]: and personal grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that, photographers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that sounds crazy, but there are
two or three photographers in the Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis scene that if you told me right
now, I need a photographer for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say, is it for like an event where
we're photographing people or is it
[SPEAKER_01]: something where we're going to take
pictures of plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you said, and I'm going to give two
shout outs here, I'm going to give two
[SPEAKER_01]: huge shout outs to two people.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you said, I want to take pictures of
cannabis plants, I would definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend a guy named Ripe Richard.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is the guy you want to take pictures of
your ganja plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you were taking pictures of a
cannabis event where there are people and
[SPEAKER_01]: things happening, you want Kim Sidwell of
cannabis camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they didn't pay me to say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are just who I think of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you want to do is become that
camera person, the photographer man,
[SPEAKER_01]: photographer woman in your area and master
the shit out of that and market yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the new industry photographer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, another good thing, lawyers,
cannabis lawyers.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can be a lawyer and focus on the
cannabis industry and work on either
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary rules or personal rules or
caregiver rules or whatever, people are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to, there are all these new rules
and people are going to fuck them up and
[SPEAKER_01]: go to jail and get themselves in trouble
trying to mingle with the new rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be a lawyer, help those people out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's a lot of schooling and you
didn't, you can't just go to a school
[SPEAKER_01]: tomorrow, but if you're a lawyer,
and you're looking for a new niche,
[SPEAKER_01]: this could be it for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also accountants, the dispensaries have a
lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need an accountant, advertising
teams.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need good marketing teams for the
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need good advertising schemes and
advertising campaigns for the
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Design teams to design the signs and our
boots and things like that for the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need those types of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Testing facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's not a testing facility in your
area, if Steep Hill Labs, if Steep Hill
[SPEAKER_01]: Halent hasn't already moved in in your
area, then open a testing facility,
[SPEAKER_01]: or even if they're already there,
open another testing facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that I'm on Periscope and people
are throwing up the ideas that I've got on
[SPEAKER_01]: my list here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good one, but I see it and I've
got it on my list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_01]: Testing facilities, other ancillary
businesses like head shops and grow
[SPEAKER_01]: stores, you guys, like Hygro Indoor
Growing Supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys are aiming at the outdoor and
indoor farmer that is producing tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this cannabis business is also
boosting their sales ridiculously.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a grow store, a head shop, most of the
dispensaries have smoking gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have dab rigs, they have bongs,
they have pipes, they have papers,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's grossly overpriced in that son of
a bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you opened up a head shop down the
street from a dispensary and sold things
[SPEAKER_01]: at a decent markup, you would make money
because people will know that this
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary charges me good price for weed,
ridiculous prices for glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go to the glass shop and buy
my smoking accessories there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody just wrote on Periscope,
they said security.
[SPEAKER_01]: Security guards are always needed at the
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need security guards for our grows,
for the dispensaries, for all of our
[SPEAKER_01]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Packaging, if you know how to make
packaging, if you can design packaging,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you are a packaging person,
that sort of stuff is needed in our
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that people overlook is
clothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: People, cannabis clothing, locally aimed
cannabis clothing sells.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got your state, if you can make
your state flag into something,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of cannabis-y, then that will sell in
your area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Web design, all of the dispensaries need
some sort of web design.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that Colorado specializes in,
we have something called a compliance
[SPEAKER_01]: specialist.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you run a dispensary or work in a
dispensary or own a dispensary,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything has to be done under a certain
set of rules that are set by the MED.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need one or two people that know all
of those rules and if you ask them a
[SPEAKER_01]: question, it's their job to go in the
office and get the book and figure out
[SPEAKER_01]: that rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your compliance specialist.
[SPEAKER_01]: He needs to be finding out all of the new
rules as they come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He needs to be walking through the grow,
through the sales area, through all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary and making sure that everything
is under compliance so that if the
[SPEAKER_01]: inspectors come in, you are cool and legit
and he keeps you out of trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dispensaries need assistance from
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, a taxi service of some sort would be
really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the obvious one.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can open a smoking club,
that would be cool as shit, but the rules
[SPEAKER_01]: are always going to be strict for that
sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I have seen is a lot of smoking
buses.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have the cannabis tour bus because
it's a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the rules on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd have to find out that in your area,
but a taxi service of some sort would be
[SPEAKER_01]: really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Transportation for intoxicated people
makes you look good and it's a good
[SPEAKER_01]: business.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else do we have?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there's a service around here that
actually hires specifically for
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a temp agency and you go and apply
and you have to get your MED badge and
[SPEAKER_01]: once you've got your MED badge,
they send you to a dispensary and you work
[SPEAKER_01]: there and it could lead to permanent
employment just like a normal job at a
[SPEAKER_01]: normal temp agency.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're designed specifically for the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could open your own temp agency to
hire people for the dispensaries so that
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary owners and managers don't have
to spend their day interviewing people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They pay you to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You send these people to the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: They work.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get paid a certain amount of money
and then you take a dollar or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You make sure that they get paid minimum
wage, but then you take a dollar or a
[SPEAKER_01]: portion of whatever they get paid to make
your business work.
[SPEAKER_01]: That happens around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, there'd be a need for
lodging, hotels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hotels will be serious when cannabis goes
recreational in your area because people
[SPEAKER_01]: will be coming from afar to the nearest
dispensaries to get cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get people from Texas, Wyoming,
Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come from all over to get weed from
us here and they're filling up the hotels.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll come take weekend trips just to
buy weed all over and they'll have to stay
[SPEAKER_01]: in a hotel somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of things that you guys could
... Those are business opportunities that
[SPEAKER_01]: you could take advantage of.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could open somewhere to actually
consume cannabis in your area,
[SPEAKER_01]: that would be ideal because here you can
buy weed at 13 different places within 10
[SPEAKER_01]: miles of each other, but there's nowhere
to legally consume your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big ass list of ancillary and
niche businesses that you could
[SPEAKER_01]: participate in without opening up your own
cannabis, but you could still capitalize
[SPEAKER_01]: on this cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, there's those little hippie stores
that sell hippie clothing like patchwork
[SPEAKER_01]: pants and tight-eyed t-shirts and fucking
hemp jewelry and all that kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you open one of those near a
dispensary and you capitalize on that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis theme, and like I said earlier,
if you use your state or your city and
[SPEAKER_01]: weed out your slogan, my logo for
iRegenetics is the Colorado flag that's
[SPEAKER_01]: turned into the Rasta colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't even know about the company
when they see it and they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: holy shit, I love that shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be a good way to take your
state flag or your city logo or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: and turn it into some sort of cannabis
theme to flag and make a spoof of it and
[SPEAKER_01]: sell that in your store in your area.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would sell, that would crush.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all right, I've gone on a long time
about this subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna take a drink of root beer and
then we're going to actually check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have been on Periscope the entire time
I've been recording and I told those
[SPEAKER_01]: people on Periscope that we would take
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see that we have 17 people on Periscope
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to go about nine or eight more
minutes in this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if Periscope has got any questions for
me, please type in your questions while I
[SPEAKER_01]: take a drink and I will read my favorite
questions and then I'll try to answer them
[SPEAKER_01]: the best that I can for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while I take a drink, you guys start
typing your questions there on Periscope
[SPEAKER_01]: for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, that's funny because usually
Periscope is filled with questions and now
[SPEAKER_01]: they seem like they're stumped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Earlier on Periscope, somebody asked me,
what is the difference between wax and
[SPEAKER_01]: shatter?
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically I am not the hash maker here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my experience from watching and
hearing my hash maker friends talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference between wax and shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most BHO, okay, somebody asked me a
question there and I'm gonna write it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm writing it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel about smoking and driving?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna answer that in a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm writing it down, smoke and drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, but I was answering the first
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the difference between wax and
shatter?
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically when you make BHO, if it's done
right, they'll both come out very near,
[SPEAKER_01]: when it's done right, it'll come out very
near shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: The consistency will be very near shatter,
if not sappy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this point, if you vacuum purge it
properly and don't mess with it too much,
[SPEAKER_01]: it will stay shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will come out, shatter is more like,
sorry, I'm burping after my drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shatter is like a Jolly Rancher
consistency where it's kind of snappy,
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll break.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we call it shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a little piece of glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you chip at it too hard, it'll shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most hash, most BHO ran properly will
turn into shatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the way that you make it into wax is
right before it cools.
[SPEAKER_01]: How tight's the open container law?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody asked me a question on Periscope
that said, how tight's the open container
[SPEAKER_01]: laws?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not experienced with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my area, they don't give a shit,
but in some areas they really do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me continue with my shatter versus
wax part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we've got this shatter,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard, it's stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you could turn that into wax by
heating it or before you even let it warm,
[SPEAKER_01]: just keep it warm, before you let it cool,
keep it warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you do is whip it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know what they use to whip it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a few things like I saw one guy
use a metal pick like for your Afro
[SPEAKER_01]: because it had four or five little fingers
coming off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess their teeth if they're on the
pick, but he would put that in the Pyrex
[SPEAKER_01]: dish of hash and just stir it around
really rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what he was trying to do is whip it
like he was stirring some kind of food and
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to put air into it and make it
fluffy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what that does is it fluffs it up
and then when it dries, there's air
[SPEAKER_01]: trapped in there and it just dries up a
little bit differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the science behind why,
but it makes it waxy and it's a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: easier to handle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they put that in the vac oven just
like they do the shatter and they clean it
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that's not the most technical
answer, but the main difference between
[SPEAKER_01]: wax and shatter is the whipping action
that happens right before it's finished.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just whip it up and put a little bit
of air in it and it makes a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: fluffy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody on Periscope says, keep the vac
at 120 and it will bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but 120 is a little high.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when you start burning off turps is
about 106, 110-ish.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So somebody asked me how I feel about
smoking and driving.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot advocate you smoking cannabis and
driving.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say to do that, but again,
I can't be a hypocrite because I do it
[SPEAKER_01]: myself occasionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: How I feel about it is if you know your
limits and you're not going to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: dipshit out there on the road and you're
not fucked up, drive if you've had a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're the kind of person that
smokes and goes full retarded,
[SPEAKER_01]: don't get behind the wheel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Know your limitations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check yourself before you hurt somebody or
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I really feel about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be a hypocrite if I came on here
and I said, don't take dabs and drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe don't take dabs and drive
simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try not to smoke in the car.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just don't be that asshole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about the news article about you
when you fuck up in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out what you're doing and say,
huh, I'm about to be a news story.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I crash into somebody right now
while I'm smoking this bong in the car,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be on the news.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to look like an asshole.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be a black eye for the
cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I don't want to get pulled over while
I'm taking this dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about that kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want to get blazed before you
drive and you can handle it and you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: an idiot, that's your thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't drink a drop of alcohol and drive
because I'm a hypocrite maybe,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I feel alcohol really fucks with your
equilibrium, your balance, your depth and
[SPEAKER_01]: perception.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really fucks you up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're a medical marijuana
consumer, you've got a tolerance,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're experienced, and you're not smoking
it just to get retarded high.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're smoking just to get retarded
high, don't drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chill out for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let somebody drive for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call an Uber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do whatever you got to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my opinion on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Periscope, you have one more
question for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be perfect to get one more question
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on Periscope, they're sending me a
bunch of hearts, which means they got love
[SPEAKER_01]: for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it technically illegal to drive high?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is technically illegal to drive high.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's driving under the influence of
drugs or driving with the ability
[SPEAKER_01]: impaired, depending on how they book you
or how they write it down or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what the difference would be,
but it is absolutely illegal to drive
[SPEAKER_01]: while you're high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's definitely looked down upon.
[SPEAKER_01]: DUI, somebody on Periscope says DUI,
it's driving under the influence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, don't be high when you're
driving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the cops ask you how long ago you
smoked, say six hours ago, be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's been at least six hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you, but if you're smoking a joint
in the car, if you got a blunt burning,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's no excuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm waiting for Periscope to throw up one
more question.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they don't throw up one more question,
we will start closing up the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's my favorite part of my job?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, open container.
[SPEAKER_01]: So favorite part of my job in open
container.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to write down the open
container.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I wrote down open content.
[SPEAKER_01]: That looks terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be in the cannabis, cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I get involved in the biz?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to write that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's, and now guys slow down with
the questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I've got fucking one that I wrote
down and one that I forgot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remind me the one, what favorite part,
fave part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm writing all this shit down guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I got to go fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I work in MJ?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got three questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to answer these.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you throw up more questions,
I'm sorry, I probably won't get to them
[SPEAKER_01]: unless it's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's my favorite part of my job?
[SPEAKER_01]: My job is to provide the best quality
cannabis that I can for the customers at
[SPEAKER_01]: the spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dispensary my other job is to provide the
best quality cannabis that I can for the
[SPEAKER_01]: medical marijuana patients, which have
designated me as their caregiver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the other part of my job is to host a
podcast that teaches other people how to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow better cannabis to improve the
quality of their own lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, another big part of my job that people
don't realize is I'm a father,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I am shaping somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm creating another person into what I
hope to be a successful and happy human
[SPEAKER_01]: being.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the favorite part of my job is,
uh, helping other people out and seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: the positive effect that the, the work I
do has on other people's lives because
[SPEAKER_01]: honestly, I grow weed and I'm a dad and
play on Instagram and I play on Periscope
[SPEAKER_01]: and it feels like I'm just playing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big man child because my job is what
I love.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't feel like I'm working and
that right there may be my favorite part
[SPEAKER_01]: of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't feel like I'm working ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll become completely sweaty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's a good question, but I'm
probably not going to get to that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, text that to me on, uh, on Twitter and
I'll answer that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, I do play the drums.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think my favorite part of my job is
seeing people happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've got a patient named Doug.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a 60 year old guy and he feels like
shit half the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I grow cannabis that I know he loves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go to his house and I roll up a big
fat joint or I give him a dab and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: like, Hey Doug, let's hang out and smoke
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I get there, he's hurt or sick
and depressed and he's got a shitty look
[SPEAKER_01]: on his face.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time I leave, the dude's got a
smile on his face and he loves the world
[SPEAKER_01]: and he loves life again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of that is my interaction with
the guy, but a large portion of that is
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a large portion of that is the
cannabis that I grew from my heart and
[SPEAKER_01]: gave to this whole guy to feel better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's probably the favorite part of my
job is that I get, I'm healing people,
[SPEAKER_01]: even the people that are smoking cannabis
recreationally, it's healing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels better to take a fat puff of
ganja and blow out that smoke and just
[SPEAKER_01]: feel better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get to do that to people every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to see that it is all in the love.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: So somebody asked me, what's my favorite
part?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to see people improve their lives
with from my work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that makes me feel golden inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody asked me about an open container
law here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've, we've started treating cannabis
like alcohol is our new model here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got what's called the open
container law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, I am not up to date on the
open container law.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know enough about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my city, you can drive around with your
dab rig on the dash.
[SPEAKER_01]: My city is a little bit gangster and
nobody cares what you're doing here,
[SPEAKER_01]: as long as you're not shooting at each
other when you drive by.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other places, you've got to have your
stuff in a childproof container or a
[SPEAKER_01]: sealed container in your vehicle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got to be out of your reach and
in the trunk, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my vehicle doesn't have a trunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I put it in my backpack and then I put
it in the back seat.
[SPEAKER_01]: But quite often, honestly, there's a dab
rig in my center of culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know enough about that open
container law to be useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not a lawyer, so don't follow my
advice on that shit at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody asked, how do I get to work in
the marijuana industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to start by applying for your,
if you're coming to Colorado, you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: start by applying for your marijuana
enforcement division badge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to go to the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure which website it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have time to research,
but if you search it, how do I find my
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana enforcement badge for Colorado?
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll find the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be a list of instructions,
fill out the application.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have to come to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have to be fingerprinted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they'll let you know if you pass
that background check or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much is the badge?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are two levels of badges.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is $150 and one is $300.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to take a check.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not accept cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to make an appointment,
download the application, fill out the
[SPEAKER_01]: application, make an appointment to go,
get a check.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, it's a money order.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a check or a money order.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a money order.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a money order.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get yourself a money order.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to the appointment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody just asked me what's allowed to
be on your background.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically no drug felonies.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have got college loans and shit,
you got to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be in good standing with all
of your college loans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your child support has to be up to date.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be pretty legit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're fucking around, they're going to
want to know why you're fucking around.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to ask you questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get the application filled out,
get yourself a badge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the thing to do is hit every
dispenser you can with a resume and
[SPEAKER_01]: explain to them why you're the employee
that they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're not experienced in the
cannabis industry here in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to be difficult getting your
foot in the door because the dispensaries
[SPEAKER_01]: are full.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have been employed there for quite
a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you can get into the
cannabis industry with marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: misdemeanors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really do not know the, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have that right on hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I would have prepared that question,
I would have researched it for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But since we're doing it right off,
right off the cuff here, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so you get your badge and then you
come here and then you apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then hopefully you get somebody's
attention and you're probably going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have to start by being like a tremor or a
bud tender or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would learn how to trim weed is
probably where you're going to start
[SPEAKER_01]: because unless you're a master grower and
you can prove it, nobody's going to let
[SPEAKER_01]: you start off being a master grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be an hourly tremor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So work on your resume, start learning how
to trim weed, learn how to be chipper,
[SPEAKER_01]: crow some boobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate to say it, but dispensaries will
hire you if you have got some boobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a cute 22, 25 year old chick and
you can flirt with the customers and you
[SPEAKER_01]: can sell them some shit, there's a good
chance you're going to get a job in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's enough of my Periscope questions
for today, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much on Periscope for asking
questions and participating in the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys that aren't on Periscope that are
just listening on iTunes or Stitcher or
[SPEAKER_01]: the website, thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to find me on Periscope,
it's at Rasta Jeff 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would appreciate you checking out my
Periscope videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do about one Periscope, maybe two videos
every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take some dabs and hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody said, let me trim for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will you teach me?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll show you on a video.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do some Periscope and trim on the
video.
[SPEAKER_01]: I trim on Periscope quite often,
but you guys that are listening,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you want to check it out, it would be
really fun to see you on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can ask questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will start scheduling podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard for me to schedule when I'm
going to record because I don't know when
