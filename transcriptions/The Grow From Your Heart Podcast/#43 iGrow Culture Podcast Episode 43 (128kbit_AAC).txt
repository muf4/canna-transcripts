[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, what's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time for episode number 43 of the I
Grow Culture podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: The podcast all about cannabis news,
education, and culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a new grower, a professional
grower, a longtime cannabis consumer,
[SPEAKER_04]: a brand new smoker, or even someone who's
just curious about the current state of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks again for joining us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, as promised at the table today is
our good friend, King Cola.
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing, brother?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks a lot for coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for taking time out of your busy
schedule.
[SPEAKER_04]: All these growers are super busy.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're sitting here talking about all the
stuff we're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing, Jesse?
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You looking better this week?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: My skin complexion is the right color.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on both feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Quit making fun of Jesse.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's back.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's on his feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: We took a lot of dabs today.
[SPEAKER_04]: He redeemed himself.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's on his game.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sean brought some solventless.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Jesse did not die.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: My blood sugar is correct today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was worried about coming on here
with you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a big BHO smoker.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even ask that question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to ask that as the show
progressed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a BHO question for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was going to see if you're a dabber.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up with Spencer, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the same sense, I was pampered.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you smoke his chatter,
you can't really go to smoking a
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was just like, screw it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll make some ice wax.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you smoke live resin?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had the pleasure of trying it a
couple of times from his personal stash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And good gracious.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to steal some of his tech on that
one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Terpy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Terpy, slurpy.
[SPEAKER_04]: By the time this episode airs,
in my mind, I feel like Spencer will have
[SPEAKER_04]: won the Secret Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's a safe assumption.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's there now.
[SPEAKER_04]: The competition actually happens Sunday
night.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the judging happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: So by the time this episode comes out,
he will be the champion of the Secret Cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can reveal what was entered.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was White Widow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grown by Rasta.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's like, oh, no, no, you can't.
[SPEAKER_04]: You look to me like you can't say that,
but this won't come out.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is now that everybody knows now it
was White Widow grown by Rasta Jeff of
[SPEAKER_04]: iRegenetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Spence gave me the cut a while back.
[SPEAKER_04]: I crossed that cut to Grateful Dog and I
actually made Capelton with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that White Widow, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: It grows like a boss.
[SPEAKER_04]: It kicks out multiple donkey dicks,
like menorahs of donkey dicks.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope that does well for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you brought home a trophy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Either way, if he won or not, I plan to
get him here on the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: He might be the episode after this.
[SPEAKER_04]: His schedule pending.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's up to him.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's invited.
[SPEAKER_04]: He knows he's welcome any time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully we can get him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out Spence.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Big D.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Jeremy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out everyone involved with the
Secret Cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do a wrap up on that one in the next
show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do an ad real quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to pay some bills before we get too
far.

got.
[SPEAKER_04]: My buddy Giddy up in Emotec sent me the
sweetest brand new G nail.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It works like a boss if you're in the
market for a G nail.
[SPEAKER_04]: An E nail that stays hot at the perfect

[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to save you a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're buying a Nano Lux Lite,
you're going to save quite a few bucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse just looked at me like, we didn't
think of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got them in stock now too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got enough to get going there in the
store.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just saw you visualize the shelf.
[SPEAKER_04]: He looked up at my wall as if the shelf
would be there and he could see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think he counted them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how many is there or if we're
going to get the order by the time the
[SPEAKER_02]: show shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's two different numbers going
through my head there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Either way, they will get your Nano Lux
lighting needs taken care of.
[SPEAKER_04]: They look to be quality lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: Much love to all the sponsors.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, thanks for helping us out.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're interested in sponsoring the
show, email me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hygroculture at hotmail.com and we'll
get it going.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've got a couple of things I got to
say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to Angela, Adam and Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, you guys trimmed for seven hours
last night.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have gotten nuts without it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sean just looked over and saw the trimmed
pots and shook his head.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are big pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been at it for like a week trimming
by myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know good trimmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you need them, I'll give you their
numbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're yours.
[SPEAKER_04]: They need money.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just got to pay them decently.
[SPEAKER_04]: So big shout out to those guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: They helped me out trim and I could not
have got through it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also a big, huge shout out to Hanky B.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hanky B gave me some live res into dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was hanging out at his house and as I
left, he goes, here man, take some of this
[SPEAKER_04]: and just gave me like a gram of live res.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure you follow him on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's hankyb11.
[SPEAKER_04]: He told me to make sure I say that because
he gave me a hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a big shout out to Hank.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll skip some shout outs for now.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get onto the meat of the show here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a guy that does all kinds of
organics and we've been talking about a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of grow lessons.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess the first question to jump
right into it, dude, if we just want to
[SPEAKER_04]: get down to it, you want to tell me all
about organic as fuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well organic as a fuck is just a
hashtag we started using.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was created by Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse actually started the hashtag and
stole it off of his page.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, the idea is that all organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't like the idea of any bottled
fertilizers, synthetic nutrients,
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically pesticides, anything with
mineral salts, MAP and DAP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mono ammonium phosphates, preservatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea is to create a clean product,
food grade, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably buy half of the products I use
at our local natural grocers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really big emphasis on growing style.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most growers tend to focus on flour where
we focus on the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel a lot of stuff is lost when you're
just focusing on weight, high vegetative
[SPEAKER_01]: yields, quit flowering times.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just losing a lot of money,
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just losing so much in that
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then hurting the environment and a lot
of other people along the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: That part is what's really got me
interested.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to learn a lot from you to maybe
shift my grow toward this style.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my reasoning is the sustainability.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a kid and she's 11 now and I keep
thinking about the stuff that I hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: I read about what they're making my
nutrients out of.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'm thinking about, I toured a
large grow facility that runs a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: hydro and they have lots of water that has
to be flushed out as waste.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought, where does that go?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going back to our municipal water
supply and being filtered out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you get water out of the sink,
that's what we're drinking.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that really that stuff the past few
years has had me think.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to get more sustainable and no
offense to the hydro shops, but I love
[SPEAKER_04]: them because they help us out.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we don't need to be paying over marked
prices for a botanic air bottle because it
[SPEAKER_04]: says botanic air.
[SPEAKER_04]: When Sean can teach us how to take that
chicken shit and seabird guano and make
[SPEAKER_04]: something that we can, one day the end of
the world is coming and you can't go to
[SPEAKER_04]: the hydro shop then.
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sean's going to outgrow us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sean's going to outgrow all of us when
that day comes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do feel hypocritical sometimes because I
use very few products from our store as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But see your store, it has the option.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ours is a little different than most I
like to think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was pretty blown away when I first
walked in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's coming from a guy who just who
absolutely hates hydro stores.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're doing it mostly out of the
organics for the clean product,
[SPEAKER_04]: for the food grade.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm interested more for the
sustainability.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's both a great reason to do
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing that got my attention right off
the bat, you said you don't use any
[SPEAKER_04]: pesticides or nonorganic pesticides.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really curious and I bet the listeners
are too.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you keep bugs out of your crop
without some nuclear attack right at the
[SPEAKER_04]: beginning of the fall?
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody I know got three types of bugs
at once.
[SPEAKER_04]: Three letters, I-P-M.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I guess what that means?
[SPEAKER_04]: Ladies and gentlemen, integrated pest
management.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please write that down.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's important.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will talk about that a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be a glossary term that
you need to mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: I-P-M, integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prevention is the only guaranteed form of
pest control.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't want to deal with pests,
then you have to start a program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that starts with a nice organic base.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to start out with things high in
chitin, insect frass, crab meal,
[SPEAKER_01]: things, neem cake, all of that into the
soil mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you want to start off on a regiment
of silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Aloe vera.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to strengthen the plant,
help it build its cell walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, you need to build its immune
system so it can take care of itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: So throw away the bottle of potassium
silicates and use the aloe vera and the
[SPEAKER_04]: neem.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the other one that you said that
I felt would really build the cell walls?
[SPEAKER_01]: The silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Silica is just such an underutilized thing
in growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure both of you guys can
contest to that in synthetics or hydro,
[SPEAKER_01]: organic, whatever you're running.
It builds cell walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all the fiber growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the stronger your leaf wall is,
the stronger it's going to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: stand up to attack.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you use to get silica in organics?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of different options.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, there's thousands of different
options on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potassium silica is probably the number
one most common.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good one to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most organic companies sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally use silica derived from
diatomite through the majority of my
[SPEAKER_01]: growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potassium silica, though, does have its
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: From my clones, obviously, Leighton
Flower, I do prefer potassium silica a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the stuff that's in desiccant
packs in your box of shoes?
[SPEAKER_02]: New shoes, or you guys know what I'm
talking about?
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like a familiar word.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that I'm thinking about that,
it looks like the same word on there,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I can't promise you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it says on the side of those
little packs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: It says desiccant pack on there,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it says potassium silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't surprise me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all very common stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the diatomite, the silica derived
from diatomite is basically diatomaceous
[SPEAKER_01]: earth, which you're probably more familiar
with.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a rough texture.
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of cuts up the bulk.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like walking on glass for a bug.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your plants never get sprayed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually, they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I foliar spray every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably overkill on my foliar spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every grower likes to spend time in their
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can find a way to do it,
go for it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my way is to spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do break it down into regimens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Dragonfly Earth Medicine with
their natural mystic teas of foliar
[SPEAKER_01]: sprays, their soil inoculars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other herbal inoculates, but that's a
big part of my spray regimen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Homemade compost teas, FPJs, FFJs,
so fermented fruit juices, fermented plant
[SPEAKER_01]: juices that I make myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're actually spraying that on your
plants?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm spraying that on the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: How late into flower would you do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually don't go past week four or five,
just like a traditional spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though it's organic, things just tend
to stick around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can cause problems going past week
four or five, I assume.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially everything that I use is very
sugary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fruit juices and plant juices and
everything's got molasses.
[SPEAKER_04]: He brought some nugs, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to say that I was a hater of
organics, but I feel he stood up for
[SPEAKER_04]: himself before anybody even mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, I brought this to show you that
it's dense and it's odorifice and it's
[SPEAKER_04]: covered in trichomes and it's all of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The trichomes are actually real.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't stick off the bud that he
showed me real far, but they're compacted.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're everywhere all over that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nugget, even between where the two little
buds touch on that branch, they're between
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got resin everywhere on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the organics do work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see the proof.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do some consulting on the side,
but I'm actually working with a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out Blood Diamond Extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really killing the game right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out your consulting company,
too, if you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Rocky Mountain Natural Farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can check us out on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Follow them, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these guys, they're making BHO.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's funny you have your little meme
on the internet of says he grows vegan and
[SPEAKER_01]: can only smoke BHO.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm pretty sure there's plenty of guys
out there who will back me on this when
[SPEAKER_01]: saying organics produce better hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel the trichomes more fully developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your membrane is more intact.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to get that mush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see it a lot, especially when making the
ice wax.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, this is some stuff that's
locally grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I smoked this the other night.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of your buddies had some of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually made it for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's organically grown,
but in the sense that you probably went to
[SPEAKER_01]: the store and bought some organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Organic soup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can look at this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It still has a nice smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the solvent list, it kind of
loses the odor, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's still got that dank smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I believe that maybe it's degrading a
little quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check the quality of that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like this one a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then check that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hit this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who did you say made this?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was made by Trichome Heavy Extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Jibs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And grown by Growing Kush One Mile High.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out Rob.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was just killing the game right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I walked into the first cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody knew who iRegenetics was.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hadn't put my face on Instagram yet,
and I had my shirt on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Growing Kush One Mile High spotted me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he goes, dude, you're iRegenetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And took a picture with me and posted it
to Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now my face was out.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what did it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what put my face on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when I was like, well, I'm the tall
guy with dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a very humble dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to get your genetics out
there, get him to grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kills it.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: At Growing Kush One Mile High,
email me, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting a seed tag.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some stuff should be ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some stuff should be ready here in a
couple of weeks, if everything goes well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that you were, I'm going to
kind of back loop here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You said that the trichomes have a better,
the trichome heads have a better casing
[SPEAKER_04]: from organics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that it's because we're using
what the plant actually wants instead of
[SPEAKER_04]: feeding it junk food out of a bottle?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel the synthetic approaches,
like you said, junk food is just such an
[SPEAKER_01]: appropriate term.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your buds are going to get denser.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to get bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to get fatter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that necessarily mean they're any
better?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only better for your wallet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're fortunate enough to be in an
industry or at a point in this industry
[SPEAKER_01]: where maybe that doesn't matter as much
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that people aren't all obsessed with
hitting seven pounds per light,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can focus a little bit more on quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: What stream was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was from BC, I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were trimming last night and there was
one plant and that's a perfect example.
[SPEAKER_04]: One plant kicked out donkey dicks the size
of my arms and then the Girl Scout cookies
[SPEAKER_04]: had little popcorn, but there was as much
resin on that little popcorn of Girl Scout
[SPEAKER_04]: cookies as there was spread amongst that
entire other plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so dank.
[SPEAKER_04]: That little cookies plant is just coated.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd rather grow more of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I didn't have picky patients,
if my patients weren't demanding of the
[SPEAKER_04]: grateful dog and other strains,
I'd grow all cookies just because the
[SPEAKER_04]: resin it puts out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd grow cookies, Yeti and SFV.
[SPEAKER_04]: There'd be some grateful dog in there,
but I'd definitely have like a 36 light
[SPEAKER_04]: room of just cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cookies, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of want to mention things,
but I don't want to say too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am in the process of possibly taking on
a bad-ass position running 227 lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If everything works out within the next
month, I will be in there growing under
[SPEAKER_04]: 227 Gavitas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a little stoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all hydro tables.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So better trichome heads because of
organics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does the aloe vera have anything to do
with that, you think?
[SPEAKER_04]: The same way it makes my skin more supple
and doesn't burn under the sun or under
[SPEAKER_04]: the grow light?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can really go into the
properties of aloe and yucca and the
[SPEAKER_01]: saponin and all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 30 minutes worth of conversation,
but bottom line is, it increases the
[SPEAKER_01]: health of your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Silica, aloe, coconut water, those are the
bases outside of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad you say that because I preach
those products other than the silica.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm always about aloe and coconut water.
[SPEAKER_04]: I teach a lot of people that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's a necessity.
[SPEAKER_01]: The coconut water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yucca, it's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I drink coconut water myself and I feel
amazing when I drink it.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the style of gardening that I use,
I like the idea that me and my plants
[SPEAKER_01]: share the same food.
[SPEAKER_04]: The more I grow and the more I evolve into
this, I think my plants, I was a
[SPEAKER_04]: vegetarian before I grew.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took decent care of myself, but I think
learning about the plant biology has made
[SPEAKER_04]: me take better care of myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's influenced my shopping when I go to
Vitamin Cottage or whatever grocery store
[SPEAKER_04]: I hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse has done it too.
[SPEAKER_04]: His organic practices have influenced my
shopping and my eating a little bit,
[SPEAKER_04]: which in turn has affected my growing
because now you're here to teach me how to
[SPEAKER_04]: be more healthy, more sustainable.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see it going full circle.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a passion there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like people maybe put a little bit
too much emphasis on the switch.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're running soiless and you're
running botanic care, you're almost there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just scared, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: My patients love what I do and I've got
Grateful Dog grown to perfection with the
[SPEAKER_04]: way I do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can get it that way with a few strains,
but it's a big jump for me to just go
[SPEAKER_04]: change.
[SPEAKER_04]: I may do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to write down what you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: People will probably disagree with me on
this, but I don't think you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: lose yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: I swear up and down that this whole
organics yields less.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a misconception in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, you do have people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a different approach than traditional
gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got guys out there who have been
doing hydro or soiless mixes for years,
[SPEAKER_01]: switching to super soils and burning their
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organics doesn't yield anything,
but it reflects a lot on the grower also.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think somebody like you could definitely
just take off with it, especially with
[SPEAKER_01]: your experience with additives.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the key.
[SPEAKER_01]: With organics, you start a base.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people like to water every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't use anything but water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me personally, I like to water never.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your style now where you're giving
it ... I don't know all the product name,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're giving them silica and you're
giving them yucca and you're giving them
[SPEAKER_01]: everything that I am.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just in a liquid bottle.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing it the lazy way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how most of that stuff is made is
it's a compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make a compost tea and then basically
they'll arrest fermentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They stop and kill all the living
organisms in there, run it through a
[SPEAKER_01]: protein skimmer, bottle it up and then
sell it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just cut out the middle, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just make it yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: By the summer, guys, we should all be
making our own newts.
[SPEAKER_04]: When it's warm and we're in Colorado,
I'm not going out in the backyard and
[SPEAKER_04]: doing it this week, but I got a garage.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I had some space, by the summer,
we'll get it going.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll all be grown organic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get away.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to support the hydro shops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go buy the organics there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get the stuff that's in the box,
the blood meal, the bone meal things.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're doing that, get your worm
castings and stuff, whatever you eat
[SPEAKER_04]: locally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to Hygro and make sure that when you're
mixing your soil, talk to Jesse about that
[SPEAKER_01]: because he can fill you in on the whole
bone meal and blood meal thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse loves to talk to people at Hygro.
[SPEAKER_01]: He loves to just stand there and get paid
to talk to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's better than advanced, but bone meal
and blood meal can be approved upon as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: This goes back to the veganics we were
talking about before the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: By no means do I claim to be a veganic
grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use a hashtag called Beyond Veganics to
poke fun at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just for the simple fact, vegan growing is
funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like vegans are, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you know someone's a vegan?
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry, they'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: These vegan organic growers, they're using
just bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just plain and simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're not, they're really depriving
their plants of certain things they could
[SPEAKER_01]: be using.
[SPEAKER_01]: Earthworm castings, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, there's a nice little shout out you
can get right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Jay, Rocky Mount Earthworm Castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Jesse uses it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're super high quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is killing the game right now,
dedicated his life to making castings for
[SPEAKER_01]: people like me and Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard a lot of good things.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a customer of my store and you
use earthworm castings, ask me for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, please do.
[SPEAKER_01]: As an organic grower, I've been in
Colorado for about two years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before then, I grew- Is that all I've
known you, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's two years?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only been two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seems like it's been a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time flies, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a degree in horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from North Carolina, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: But back there, I grew also.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was organically, small scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've been doing teas and soil mixes
for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming out here really opened my eyes to
the fact that you think you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: come out to Colorado, you think you're
going to grow organics, you think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: this big popular thing, but it's all about
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I met Jay, and then he had these high
quality castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never turned back, met him probably
within a month of being here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been using his castings ever since.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does all testings on his stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super high quality, and that's
really- Yeah, I saw you posted some today,
[SPEAKER_02]: actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and that's really the key to
basically what I do is my castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plain and simple, everybody wants to know,
how do I do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Jay's castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without a microbial inoculate,
not microbial source, I couldn't do what I
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people source, you know,
wrigglers or castings from stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make your own compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably the best way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your own worm castings is probably the
best way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, a lot of people,
I call it green washing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go out and they buy something because
it looks organic or it looks like it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be- All natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this environmental friendly product.
[SPEAKER_01]: These companies are preying on the
consumer just like they would in any other
[SPEAKER_01]: organic companies aren't any nicer than
synthetic companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a company right now, for example,
that loves to kick out this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They throw numbers at people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your average grower doesn't really
understand how these work.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, like Jesse was saying,
Jay actually posted something earlier
[SPEAKER_01]: about the worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, I wanted to bring this up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do your research.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, you've got a company out
there who's throwing this number around
[SPEAKER_01]: 30,000 plus microbe, living microbes in
your tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use it and multiply it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you read Jay's test and it's like 6.9
million protozoa in one gram of material.
[SPEAKER_01]: In one pound, that's over three billion
protozoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's before you multiply it in your
brewer.
[SPEAKER_01]: To everybody out there that's using these
products, these sales pitches,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're selling you the shake.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting seeds and stems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think you're getting a leg up,
but really you're paying for an overpriced
[SPEAKER_01]: brewer and somebody to put stuff in a bag
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all you're paying when the bottle
... It's a lot like clothes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're paying for the label.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're paying for that Nike symbol,
that botanical symbol, that advanced
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Jay.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's doing it big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only worm castings, he can source a
lot of things that grow stores can't get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse can probably attend to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of things that you're just
not going to be able to source.
[SPEAKER_02]: He approaches it a little differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you get to a certain scale,
it's time to adjust from being a garage,
[SPEAKER_04]: basement, attic grower, to actually being
a horticulturalist and setting up a grow
[SPEAKER_04]: and doing horticulture.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what Jay's more aimed for.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got an email up there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he can get whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a weird question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to feed botanic hair.
[SPEAKER_04]: Will it kill my neem meal if I put it in
my soil before I mix?
[SPEAKER_01]: The only reason you really have to be
careful mixing synthetics and organics is
[SPEAKER_01]: you can really throw off your micro herd.
[SPEAKER_01]: You feed too much of something,
your fungus is going to feed at a faster
[SPEAKER_01]: rate than your bacteria, which will kill
your bacteria out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then your fungus will actually start to
pull things from the plant if it's not in
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a balancing act.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of people I've seen on
Instagram who are just absolutely killing
[SPEAKER_01]: the balancing act with the synthetics and
organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would never recommend it to anybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something we talked about in the
last shows.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, stay away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you were just extremely well versed
in what you do, I would highly recommend
[SPEAKER_01]: staying away from running synthetics and
organics at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a guy that mints his coconut soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's running full blown general
hydroponics and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: These probiotic guys now, I've seen a lot
of them running cocoa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probiotic Farmers Alliance is getting
crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's killing me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think everybody at this table knows
there's one grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: He runs organics all the way until about
week six.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then he starts just pummeling with
hammerhead and all kinds of ridiculous
[SPEAKER_04]: PGRs just to make them explode.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said that gives it the flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: To each his own?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's his grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: He can do what he wants in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just don't sell it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard they didn't make that stuff
anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they don't, but I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Bushmaster or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are two or three bottles on the
shelf at Hygro indoor growing supplies.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you use hammerhead, dude, I don't use
it anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did use it in the past.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was a new grower, I tried every
brand and I tried hammerhead.
[SPEAKER_04]: That shit made my buds larger.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll say it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're an advanced nutrients grower or
a hydro farmer and you want to clean that
[SPEAKER_04]: shit off the shelf at Jesse's shop,
go get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's $107 a bottle.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll make you a deal for a whole bunch of
advanced nutrients stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Advance is on really good sale right now
at Hygro indoor growing supplies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Say you listen to the Hygro culture show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of advanced, I had something
written down.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've already gone a half hour guys with
this show, maybe a little longer than an
[SPEAKER_04]: hour if nobody minds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't you guys, I'm going to take a
dab and I'm going to, this is,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm starting to fight right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me a little bit about PGRs and how
you feel about them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to, I'm going to jump in real
quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: PGR stands for plant growth regulator,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I'm going to let Sean tell us
about those while I take a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a time and place for everything,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not in my food crops, at least not
synthetically made PGRs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's obviously plenty of ways to use
natural PGRs, plant hormones, gibberellic
[SPEAKER_01]: acid, triacan and all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gibberellic acid?
[SPEAKER_01]: Gibberellic acid, you know, it goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to talk after the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a buttload of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do raw alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say barley sprouts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, barley sprouts works great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Barley tea every two weeks on my veg
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always actually alternate alfalfa and
barley for veg and then corn and barley
[SPEAKER_01]: for flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't used corn yet, but that's just
cause I haven't found, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Foxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh really?
Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Organic?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's I've been, yeah, learning that,
you know, a lot of cool little additives
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't find at grow stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I'm going to start having so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ferments, ferments, ferments, ferments,
like cold processed extractions.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how you're going to get your
natural PGRs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fermented plant juices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically you're going to collect growing
nodes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you teach us what a PGR actually is?
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of explain like what it is and what
it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say like what axiom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you familiar with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Explain that to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, basically what a PGR is,
is it controls the plant's growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it contains either real or synthetic
forms of plant hormones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's going to make the plant
react in a certain way, usually by
[SPEAKER_01]: triggering like apical dominance or
stimulating the plant's SAR.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different ways that these PGRs can
affect the plants, but for the most part,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're just applying it to the plant at a
certain stage in its growth cycle to make
[SPEAKER_01]: it do what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just manipulating nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the most popular one, I think that a
lot of us have used in the past would be
[SPEAKER_04]: Snowstorm, Snowstorm Ultra.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically they've taken, I think it's
Sea Kelp and other plant proteins and
[SPEAKER_04]: concentrated them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't I want to feed that to my
plants?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just being, I'm just trying to,
so that we can get the listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is, is a lot of those,
you know, I can't really tell you without
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at the bottle what exactly is in
it, but if you're telling me it's the
[SPEAKER_01]: kelp, me personally, my favorite flower
hardener back when I used to use bottled
[SPEAKER_01]: organics was, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendo Avalanche, Mendocino Avalanche,
which is basically two different types of
[SPEAKER_01]: kelp and molasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that I've actually kind of adapted that
to my.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just replace the old crap and use kelp
and molasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just make the real deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Natural, healthy PGRs versus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that goes right back into the
fermented like plant juices, extracts is
[SPEAKER_01]: the way to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically the same idea as if you
want to, if a human wants to get ripped,
[SPEAKER_04]: you shouldn't go inject steroids and sit
on the couch.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should go to the gym, eat protein,
eat vegetables, get all the things you
[SPEAKER_04]: need and work out.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not giving our plants a workout.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're feeding them energy bars and protein
shakes and treating them like shit and
[SPEAKER_04]: expecting them to be fully healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need balanced healthy plants,
not just steroid boosted plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use PGRs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Axiom is one of the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've used lots of it, not on my personal
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen the results of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, just the idea of it is,
you're using this synthetic to stimulate
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant's SAR.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it systematic automated response?
[SPEAKER_01]: The first word might be off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's some sort of automated response.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically it's the plant's ability to
protect itself and its defense mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the reason the plant produces resin
is to protect itself basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what Axiom does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stimulates that chain reaction inside
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going into defense mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: It almost stresses the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's exactly what it's doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's chemically stressing the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jess can probably contend with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're messing with gibberellic acid
and stuff, I get a lot of fox tailing when
[SPEAKER_01]: I use it later into flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's usually with any PGR.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gibberellic acid at one point was a choice
for people creating pimini seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes them too stretchy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've found silver thiosulfate that I make
myself is the best way for reversing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was meeting with some old heads this
morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were talking about colloidal silver
and cloning.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to reverse seeds,
definitely make your own silver
[SPEAKER_04]: thiosulfate at home.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really easy to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make everything at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really easy to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to apologize also.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you live in an apartment, if you're a
new grower, if you're not striving for
[SPEAKER_04]: what we are, don't feel bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Use your bottles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do what you can.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a medical patient and you don't
have the physical ability to mix this shit
[SPEAKER_04]: up, we're not hating you.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just recommending.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're encouraging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reach out to us because we definitely have
ways that we could help you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you live in an apartment, if you are
unable to mix your soil or make your own
[SPEAKER_01]: teas, there are definitely options out
there for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: See that stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Community on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody deserves that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get in Jesse's awesome ass truck and
we'll drive up your mountain and we'll
[SPEAKER_04]: come mix up soil in your yard for you and
we'll put it in pots and we'll carry it in
[SPEAKER_04]: and hopefully you can get your wheelchair
between the plants to water them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I think people kind of
overcomplicate things with organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, if you want to grow organics or
start growing organics, I'd recommend
[SPEAKER_01]: going and finding a nice organic bottled
line of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Roots organic, general organic,
age old organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the list goes on and on and
their bio-biz.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty simple stuff too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their fish hydroslate is very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to use it when I was back in the
disay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, I'd recommend picking up a
nice bottled organic nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then outside of that, go and get you some
nice Rocky Mount worm casting style worm
[SPEAKER_01]: castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: The quality is extremely important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot stress that enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find high quality worm castings or find a
high quality microbial source and then
[SPEAKER_01]: molasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's your compost tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sean is pretty much describing the way I
grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're supposed to call him something
different the whole time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's basically the way I grow inside and
I can promise you, you get stuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just replacing, you know,
synthetics have chelates and that's kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of the idea of using the tea with your
organic bottled nutrient is when you feed
[SPEAKER_01]: with the nutrient, you're putting it in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're feeding with your tea,
you're activating that soil to help it eat
[SPEAKER_01]: those nutrients to give it back into your
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a really good way to put that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great way to... So if you're
growing with bottled organic nutrients and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not using a tea of some sort of
microbial source, you're just hurting
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself plain and simple.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a couple of questions written down
for you and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Will you give us a quick run through five
gallon bucket on how to make a nice,
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse's done this for us, but will you
tell us how to make a nice microbial tea
[SPEAKER_04]: for just to start off with that we can use
almost any time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, without a doubt, worm castings
and molasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't get anything else,
just those two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's your microbial source and
there's a food for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on your quality of castings,
a fourth a cup per gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Molasses, depending on how often you're
using it, one teaspoon to one tablespoon
[SPEAKER_01]: per gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outside of that, kelp meal is always a
good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kelp meal, I mean, if you're not familiar
with the benefits of kelp, you should
[SPEAKER_01]: really look it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plenty of plant hormones.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a decent NPK value in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then really, go crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just molasses, earthworm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can go into kelp.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go into alfalfa depending on veg,
flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how you're going to kind of deliver
more of an NPK value to your plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you agree with the Rev's book,
True Living Organics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the Rev.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read his book, the Rev.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up learning organics just like
everybody else did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really don't agree with his stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I learned everything that I know now
from his book.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I wouldn't have went through that
trial, I wouldn't be where I am today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't be mad at him.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to learn what works for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people who have used his stuff with
great success.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's not saying to skip it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, definitely not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to read that book.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen some people crush it and have
amazing buds with super soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've seen other people have burnt up
shitty buds with super soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's how you grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done both.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are really funny about organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even with my Rocky Mountain Natural
Farming page, we kind of had to take a
[SPEAKER_01]: break with posts for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like to put informative posts up trying
to help the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're met with a lot of defiance.
[SPEAKER_04]: I quit posting a lot of stuff on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because as soon as you put up a helpful
thing, 10 people tell you why you're
[SPEAKER_04]: stupid for doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to each his own.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to agree with the way I
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if I say something wrong,
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot easier for you to focus on one
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a lot of stuff I've got to
remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've actually made mistakes on this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I felt proud to come back and say,
hey guys, last week I told you the wrong
[SPEAKER_04]: way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesse called me.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, you just said this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh shit, I did say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like people are getting too caught
up in this growing style, or that growing
[SPEAKER_01]: style, or he grows like this, or they grow
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people need to choose their own
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amateurish, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And bro science.
[SPEAKER_02]: All three of us grow different ways,
and you don't see us fighting like
[SPEAKER_02]: children.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we all borrow something from each
other.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure you've learned something,
and you've learned something from me,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I've learned five things from you,
and five from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because we're all still doing the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love talking to synthetic growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never grown marijuana synthetically.
[SPEAKER_01]: My background is in commercial
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown millions and millions of GMO,
horrible, horrible synthetic plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not proud of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Food crops?
[SPEAKER_01]: Food crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, all edible food.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can look on my Instagram and
see them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, thousands.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was 30 acres of glass greenhouses we
were running.
[SPEAKER_01]: People got to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a certain point in time that
you've got to figure out what means more
[SPEAKER_01]: to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it your money or your morals?
[SPEAKER_01]: I walked away from making $45,000 a year,
which is a good bit for me as a guy
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking student loans, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, I walked away from that and got a
part time job here in town working at a
[SPEAKER_01]: hydro store and just grew because that's
what I wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a lot easier to wake up and look
at yourself in the mirror saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I started a seed company,
because I got tired.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's kind of what led to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's how I ended up self employed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to work for somebody all day
for something I don't support for a
[SPEAKER_04]: minimum wage and hate myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd rather be kind of struggling and
really happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And have a cool job.
[SPEAKER_04]: And have a cool job.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've got everything I want.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a cool ass girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can do what I want.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a seed company.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not rich.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if I were rich, I'd just be
depressed and confused on all this money.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wouldn't know if you guys are my
friends because I'm rich or because you
[SPEAKER_04]: guys are cool as shit and we're brothers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be like, do these guys just want to
come smoke all my live resin because I've
[SPEAKER_04]: got an ounce of it in my pocket?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I've got, we are rich.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're rich.
[SPEAKER_04]: This way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause we make, we make the, we know that
we're not poisoning people.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're growing a quality product.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're contributing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're moving it forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're making the cannabis a good thing
instead of a scary thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I walked away from a $25 an hour job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they asked me to leave, but I walked
away, stomped your feet away.
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually told me, uh, I had to quit
smoking weed and I said no.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of people will tell you that
that's ridiculous, but you have to choose
[SPEAKER_04]: the decisions that make you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Happiness over money is way important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't drink a fifth of whiskey every
night now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to sobriety.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't had alcohol in a long time and
it feels so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a drinker either.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still enjoy beer, but I don't know if
I'm really, really good at drinking or
[SPEAKER_04]: really, really bad at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure which one it is, but either
way, I'm not a big person.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can tell, like one beer wasted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biggest lightweight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I bet you two beers would crush me
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be silly sitting in the corner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted, uh, you kind of, I told me
earlier, what is your average,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, harvest weight per thousand watt light
running your organics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, it varies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So last round we ran with the kind of like
the style Jesse was talking about,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, with, uh, just a bottled nutrient kind
of, or a bottled organic, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: supplemented with teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were hitting around, I say 1.7 pounds
per light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this organics guys, this last grow,
um, which is what I brought you today was
[SPEAKER_01]: grown with no bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: No bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely none.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this was all fruit juices,
plant juices, the calcium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I probably run a pretty mild
soil too, compared to like TLO or yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't, I really, uh, go light on
my soil mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think over mending is a big problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's really impressed me about
that jar you got there is that I know
[SPEAKER_02]: your, your soil mix is almost minimal.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm holding the boat up to the microphone,
but it's not loud enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we hit, uh, I hit probably 1.2.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not done pulling yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll text you with a final weight and you
can throw it up on a later show.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, right now I'm kind of looking at
1.2, but that's with no bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and these are new strains that I'm
running this round.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you have a limit on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a favorite strain to grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I'm still so, I still feel
so like new to the growing game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, growing back East and kind
of growing what you have to, you get out
[SPEAKER_01]: here and you know, so I guess flow would
probably be my favorite strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great, she loves to take good
pictures too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, outside of the flow, Citrex,
I think we were talking about that
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one is definitely going to be in the
garden for a long, long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah, outside of that, I've grown,
I've had a pleasure growing some of your
[SPEAKER_01]: gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown the grateful dog, the heart of
gold, lemon, Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the heart of gold was my personal
favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it was racy to say the least.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's, it's not like you wake up in
the middle of the night and you
[SPEAKER_01]: accidentally grab that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to put you back to sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: You fucked up.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the golden goat in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: The golden goat is definitely Sativa
heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I wish I had taken it like a week
longer than I, how long did you let it go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think I cut it at like nine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I think about 10 weeks is usually
what I recommend for the heart of gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took once at 76, 77 days once.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I think probably 72 as far as I go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So DJ short's been preaching this 11,
13 light cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I tried it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sean had a reaction right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad I decided to go that route.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a couple of things written down a
couple of ways to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm glad I went that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'll tell you my experience,
but what did you think about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Confusion, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, a little bit of information is a
dangerous thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I have to say about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I see, I was saying, I see more
expression.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plants showed more color.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, a Sativa strain that has never really
Fox tailed on me kind of made fingery
[SPEAKER_04]: buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I got a lot of color.
[SPEAKER_04]: I keep saying that the color was
tremendous on this run, but I feel like it
[SPEAKER_04]: lowered my harvest weight by somewhere
between 10 and 20%.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not, I haven't cut everything down
yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got more to go, but I could tell it
diminished my harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: That may have been from the cold,
but I really think it was from that light
[SPEAKER_04]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: I felt the same thing about it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we always preach that the most
important nutrient to our plants is the
[SPEAKER_04]: light.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we took a full hour and that's,
we took 63 hours, 65 hours away from our
[SPEAKER_04]: plants, honestly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one thing I did notice they finished
quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I probably saved two weeks on some of
my 10 or 11 week strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to finish week nine and
they'll be done.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I'm worried to let them go too long.
[SPEAKER_04]: One may herm out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see it kind of getting, it's pissy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you got to cut me down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll cut her, but I just wasn't ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, it's a neat tool and a breeding
aspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, if we were testing a cross
we had made.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're looking for phenol, if you're
phenol hunting, that is a good point,
[SPEAKER_04]: but that's probably the only time I'll use
it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hear that you've got growers and
advanced breeders and people talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just please don't try this at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's no need for you to do it
on your day to day crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stick with 1212 you guys stick with 1212.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to get adventurous,
if you're, uh, if you're kind of advanced,
[SPEAKER_04]: do what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, I don't, I don't want to hold
anybody back.
[SPEAKER_04]: But be responsible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause if you do go and herm out that crop,
you got to do something with that hermed
[SPEAKER_04]: out crop and don't go try to, you did not
just make a seed company.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not called calypso seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you hermed your crop, you didn't just
not make a seed company.
[SPEAKER_04]: You made a mistake.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to get those seeds out of there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grow them, grow them yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give them to your friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give free.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are free seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: That shit is free.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the seeds you give to your
friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: You warn them these are from herm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you'll understand hopefully what
we're, you know, all the breeders are
[SPEAKER_02]: bitching about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sean, I'm just picking on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you're good.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's another guy named Sean figure
lover.
[SPEAKER_04]: His name is Sean also.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know that's what his name is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I should even say that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: He posted a picture of himself today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you, I don't even know what he looks
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been apparently it was like seven
years or 15 years, the GMOs or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: He posted the guys a nut.
[SPEAKER_02]: His cats go, that is, that is wild.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, that is crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when you, when somebody's
standing next to you and you scroll
[SPEAKER_01]: through your Instagram feed and then you
hit vigorous page of a cat taking a shit
[SPEAKER_01]: in the toilet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our buddy vigor lover trained two
kitties, adorable kitties.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a cat guy, uh, he trained these
kitties to full on take a shit in the
[SPEAKER_04]: toilet like a human and they do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the only thing is he posts a video of
it every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I've seen more cat butthole on his
feet than I have plants lately.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to vigor lover, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, start tagging that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cats poop and hashtag I read genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, guys, we've got about 10 minutes to
go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to start.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have Sean back because we
got more stuff to talk about.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to start another long rant
because we get them going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, do you guys have any plugs or shout
outs or anything you want to do people you
[SPEAKER_04]: want to say thanks to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, just a Rocky Mount worm company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't give enough thanks to Jay and his
father.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they have an Instagram or anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: They do Rocky Mount worm company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, follow those guys, check them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what cool kids are on these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've also got a website, uh,
rockymountwormcompany.com and then they
[SPEAKER_01]: ship all over the country to high quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I happen to know a high quality nutrient
company that smuggles the stuff into
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just be thankful.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you, if you live in Colorado,
go and get the damn castings because
[SPEAKER_01]: there's people out there who just want
them so bad and just can't afford the
[SPEAKER_01]: shipping or they don't have access to
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's just such an underutilized thing
here in town.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it doesn't sound like you need a whole
bunch.
[SPEAKER_04]: You said like a quarter cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, most people are putting in a cup
per gallon, these outrageous rates and you
[SPEAKER_01]: can use a fourth of cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you have five to 10% cutting into
your soil mixes just more than enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I use like 80 pounds of it on my six
outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys will notice a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, grow a clone, grow two clones,
keep them in cups for like three weeks,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, until they're starting to get
root bounce where they're pissed off root
[SPEAKER_04]: bound.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, feed one consistently with your
microbial tea with the worm castings in
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't add that to your other one when you
feed it and pull them out of the cup and
[SPEAKER_04]: watch, you'll have thicker, fingery,
dank, happy roots on one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other one, you'll have these thin
angel hair pasta, wispy, shitty,
[SPEAKER_04]: sad roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you mulch the one that you're giving
the microbe, Jesus tripped on the net
[SPEAKER_02]: word.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if you put some mulch on there,
you'll see some really cool shit happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So try it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or just a plastic cover, some fungus among
us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Hey, uh, where do we find you on
Instagram, bro?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: King Cola.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: King underscore Cola.
[SPEAKER_01]: Follow them on there guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check me out in Rocky Mount natural
farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you can link through that on my
Instagram or Jay's Instagram, Rocky Mount
[SPEAKER_01]: worm company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a store opening soon?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I hear something about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we have a shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Up in Colorado Springs, four 11,
a four 11 a Tijuana street in Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can come and check us out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, see the worm operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check it out for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got any questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just come and ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
