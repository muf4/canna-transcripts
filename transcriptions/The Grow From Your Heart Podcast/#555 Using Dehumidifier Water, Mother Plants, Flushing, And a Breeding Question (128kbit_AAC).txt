friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, ladies and gentlemen,
let's not waste too much time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump right into the Patreon messages
for today's episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first Patreon message comes from girls
grow too big shout out to girls grow too.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says that dabbing video was bomb as
fuck man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure they are referring to the
710 episode where I took a couple of dabs
[SPEAKER_00]: and shared my dabbing equipment and showed
you guys how to take a proper dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did take a big fat chunky dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of comments on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of people said that dab would
kill me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was more concentrate than I smoke in
a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my weak supply of dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a lot of great compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for watching that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say thank you for doing
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for enjoying and learning and
thank you for the Patreon contribution and
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you for the feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I'm still new to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that video was really helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The comment I got the most was that people
got answers to questions they were
[SPEAKER_00]: embarrassed to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people were taking dabs at places and
they weren't sure how to handle some
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment or maybe they were watching
their friends take dab somewhere and they
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to join, but they were intimidated
or afraid by gear, afraid of gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they knew how to jump in because they
watched me do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed them how to use the gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're dabbing like a pro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're right up to speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting blaze with their friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message goes on to say, I can't wait
to meet you someday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as all of the restrictions are
over and we're allowed to play with our
[SPEAKER_00]: friends again, I cannot wait to meet you,
take some dabs, give you a big fat proper
[SPEAKER_00]: dab out of my rig from my concentrates,
get you so high you're uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be a really good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get some food or something after
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not too blazed for too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wraps up with take it easy,
stay safe, stay stoned, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love from Missouri.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big shout out to all of my friends out
there in Missouri, working in the new
[SPEAKER_00]: medical and or recreational cannabis
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if it's medical or
recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure they went medical out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do have cannabis in Missouri.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the last places I ever assumed,
imagined or thought would have any access
[SPEAKER_00]: to legal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep kicking ass down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you ever have any more questions,
please reach out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon is the best way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, ladies and gentlemen,
let's jump right into the Patreon message
[SPEAKER_00]: portion of today's episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first message from Patreon came from
our friend North North Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up North?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to hear from you again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message starts off a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, what's up my diggity dog
motherfucker?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he called me a bad motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, you listen to too much Joey Diaz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a break, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to love Joey, but settle down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, anyways, for the PG
version, I love you dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had a grow hack question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What works for me is I have a portable air
conditioner with an insulated ventilation
[SPEAKER_00]: going out of my tent with a fan and a
dehumidifier and the portable air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioner working again.
And so I'm going to say, what works for me
is I have an air conditioner in my tent,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the fan is working against each other
for humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that the balance works in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of wastewater that comes
from my dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wastewater does not read on my EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can I recycle this water into my
system?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my question.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our friend's got a system that's got a
dehumidifier and an air conditioner in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're finding that the dehumidifier
is creating a lot of condensation and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gathering a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen this happen a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pulling the air from the air or the
water from the air, gathering it into a
[SPEAKER_00]: little container.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got all this water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This North North Terps is going to say
this listener, but it's North North Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: North wants to know if they can use that
water, if they can recycle it into their
[SPEAKER_00]: watering system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not measuring anything on the EC
meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've put an EC meter and a PPM meter in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing in that water for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that that water is safe,
but what could happen is gunk and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly what, but buildup
could build up in your dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buildup could build up gunk, buildup,
mildew, calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly what, but random shit
could build up inside the dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get things in the hoses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get things in the filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you've had a water filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you've seen what just basic water
can do to filters and pipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes things really grody and really
dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that stuff will build up over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Possibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what's in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what's in that humidity that
you are getting into those filters,
[SPEAKER_00]: into those parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my advice would be you can use it
probably, but continue to test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that it's always testing at
zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe don't use that water right away on
all of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe test it out on a couple of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is testing at zero now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, maybe stuff will build
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe gunk, mold, junk, dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows what's going to build up in the
filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what will build up in that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't keep it super clean,
that water may have something in it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, while the machine is
new, yeah, you can probably get away with
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but I don't know that I would do that
in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure it's clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my best advice that I can give you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had varying opinions from different
expert growers on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us say, go ahead and use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us are also very paranoid that
there could be other shit in there in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my final answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use it, but pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep testing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay attention to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe dilute it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe do like 10% this water and 90% the
other water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you're kind of spreading it out,
but not wasting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe use this water for cleaning or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think you can use it as long as it
stays clean and as long as over time your
[SPEAKER_00]: machine doesn't get dirty and get junk
developing inside of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit, crap, dust, dirt, grime,
goo, whatever can build up in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boogers, it's air boogers, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's machine boogers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want that part going to your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I think I've thoroughly
discussed it everybody so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep moving with these Patreon
messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody else out there has a question,
that was harder to say than it looked,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll catch on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody else out there has a question,
I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email address is
growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the quickest way to get your
email to the top of the list is to join
[SPEAKER_00]: the Patreon campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find a tier there that gets your
email, your message right to the top of
[SPEAKER_00]: the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contribute to that campaign level,
then send me a message and I will read it
[SPEAKER_00]: on one of the next shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to do two episodes every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may have to increase it to keep up with
the incoming messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see how that goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get myself back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message came from our friend,
easy057.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up, easy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you're doing well out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The message goes, when you decide to keep
a mother plant, do you ever top,
[SPEAKER_00]: pop, crack, twist, or just grow it
naturally?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are multiple parts to this question,
so I'll stop and handle this part.
[SPEAKER_00]: A mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm growing a mother plant,
it is mainly for preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have room for a lot of plants in
production, so I don't need to produce a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep a very small mother plant and I try
to keep them growing very slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep them alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need them doing too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need them racing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need them too excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do top them because I don't need that
one big top bud touching the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I top them, make a little canopy and get a
nice little bush going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will top it, but then as it grows,
I'm taking branches from the top to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: that branching going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes, my mother plants become my
flower plants also.
[SPEAKER_00]: They become a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a few clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shape them the way that I want them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep them for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once they're big and they're shaped
the way that I want, I take a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: clones off of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those new clones then become my future
mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That big plant that's been getting worked
on goes in the room and gets worked with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It either gets flowered out or pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need small mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm just keeping a plant for
preservation as a mother plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't require a lot of clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't require a lot of production from
my moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep them small.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep them under minimal light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not even under a whole bunch of
light, just enough to keep them going,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep them alive, keep them on a 19-5
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not really pop, crack, or twist my
mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just let them grow naturally,
take the top out so that they start
[SPEAKER_00]: bushing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my first clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That first clone right off the top,
that's my next production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one veges for a while, gives me a
couple clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I flower that one generally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too much work on the mother plants
unless they're being groomed and trained
[SPEAKER_00]: and manipulated to be future flower
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another part to the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, in your experience, how long does
it take a plant like Lemon Jeffrey to go
[SPEAKER_00]: from 20 to 30% perfect trichomes to
overripe?
[SPEAKER_00]: You picked a very specific plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said Lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most plants, I'm going to say that's a
window of seven to 10, maybe seven to 14
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a three to five day period when
they're perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, ooh, tomorrow will be just
the right day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look and they're perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you got three to five days of
perfection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then about, I don't know, seven,
10, 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you start going, oops, I probably
should have cut those down a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: days ago, maybe a week ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about a week window of prime cut down
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then by day seven, you're going,
oh, they're starting to get a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: By day 10, you're like, that's a lot of
amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: By 14, you're like, oh, I should have cut
that shit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say it's a five day window of
good cutting, a seven day window of you
[SPEAKER_00]: better get it done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then by day 14, you've kind of missed your
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says, could I go into that 48 to
72 hour darkness right when I get to 20 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 30% and then harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for everything you do and the
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: High five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love the new Instagram live feeds and
YouTube videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They mentioned the Instagram live videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't mentioned that here on the show
in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every Monday at seven, 10 ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't hold me to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about seven, seven, 10, seven,
15 every Monday at seven ish mountain
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go on Instagram live.
[SPEAKER_00]: My Instagram account is irie underscore
genetics, I R I E underscore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you can spell genetics,
irie genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ramble for about an hour on
Instagram live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let the chat throw me questions,
anything they ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do my best to field the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're alive in the chat and answer your
grow question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a basic grow question,
that is a good place to catch me Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get lit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk to my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much more informal than the show,
just to relax, hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you were enjoying the
Instagram lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you're loving the new YouTube
videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take a little bit more work,
a little bit of editing, but I'm glad
[SPEAKER_00]: you're checking those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's address the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I put it into 24 to 72 hours darkness
right when I get to 20 to 30 and then
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lemon Jeffrey is not a big fan of that
long dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ran this plan a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: More of the wider leaf, shorter squatty
plants prefer that dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: The taller, thinner leaf plants are not as
much of a fan of that type of treatment,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plan, your strategy will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see a lot of dead leaves when you
take it out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be all yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll fall off, but it will work for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will not be a bad strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get them to 20 to 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about where you want them anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw them into that 48 to 72 hour and
then chop them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be just about perfect for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe cut down one plant on one day and do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut down the next one another day and do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been growing multiple plants in
the same area, just see how much they
[SPEAKER_00]: differ.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how much, which one you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way you dial it in perfectly
for your setup, but you're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: notice too much difference cutting down
two or three days apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that 48 to 72 hour darkness,
that should harden them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may make them beef up a little bit at
the end, but lemon Jeffrey is not a big
[SPEAKER_00]: fan of that sort of treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the sativa dominant cultivars are
the things that want to be put in the,
[SPEAKER_00]: or not put in the dark, the indica
dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I messed that all up, but you know
what I mean now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say it correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The indica dominant cultivars are the
plants that seem to prefer that extended
[SPEAKER_00]: dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sativa plants, they just go a little
bit crazy, get kind of angry.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is another part to this
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy followed up a few days later.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, when you were ramping down PPM
and you go into flush, do you maintain the
[SPEAKER_00]: same distance with your lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started to ramp down and go into
flush, it seems like my plants act like
[SPEAKER_00]: they are too close to the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love and appreciation for everything
you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could attach pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, my lemon Jeffrey is killing it,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am excited to smell and smoke some of
that lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hang out one of these days and talk
shop, but let's address this question
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we are ramping down PPMs and going
into flush, do I maintain the same
[SPEAKER_00]: distance with my lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at this point, my lights are
probably raised as high as they go because
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants have grown all the way into the
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't waste any space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get the plants as tall as they can go in
my spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a lot of commercial environments,
the lights stay at one height.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're 12 or 16 or 18 feet high.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stay there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't move.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where they go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't move them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on a trapeze with a hundred lights
in one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not movable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lights stay there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a personal grow, like I said,
the plants have grown so tall that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: nowhere to move the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were saying that it looks like the
plants are starting to act as if they are
[SPEAKER_00]: too close.
[SPEAKER_00]: I followed up with the backup question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, what gives you the idea that it
looks like the plants are too close?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said that the leaves start doing
funny things and the pistols start
[SPEAKER_00]: curling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is just the plant being done.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no more nutrient left.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant's like, Hey, you were feeding me
and now there's no more nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to freak out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves kind of curl up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sucking all of the nutrients,
all the sugars, all the energy from those
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's just the end of the
plant's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's done and it knows it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks a little bit upset about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the good thing is we're not growing to
smoke a leaf, consume leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those leaves look a little shitty at
the end, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want big fat trichome covered buzz that
tastes delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your leaves are kind of yellow and
crispy and fallen off, that's a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good sign that you possibly
probably flushed and there's nothing left
[SPEAKER_00]: in that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to burn nice and smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll burn clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll taste real well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All your friends will be really proud,
be really impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't choke.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be a great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think you're too close to the
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like you're too close,
if the plants are too close, raise it up a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's not an option, maybe you can
turn it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure your situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're in a tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a room, I don't know if
you're limited on height.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you can go any higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you can turn down the
ballast, but the only way to find out is
[SPEAKER_00]: to experiment and do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, I think that last little bit
is when the plants want the most light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't stress too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're going to be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, the only way to learn is to
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, I've got one long
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long is this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: This one may take us a minute to get
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to take a little bit of a
drink here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to journey into this
message that comes from our friend Blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys sing the Jeopardy song in your
head or something while I do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I feel much better about my
life and about myself now that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into this message from our boy
Blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one goes, Hey, Rasta Jeff,
I've been listening for some time now,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I've been meaning to give you some
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ever feel like you have to
contribute to get help from me,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is a good way to get you to the top
of the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I listened to your show,
I'd work regularly and it really helps me
[SPEAKER_00]: get through some of the long, tedious,
hot and mundane work days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love knowing I'm getting people through
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was working in the commercial grow
and I was getting all sweaty and had Joey
[SPEAKER_00]: Diaz in my ear, I felt the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe Diaz, Joey Rogan, just getting me
through life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels real good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I can give you that feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it goes on to say the production
quality is excellent and the advice is
[SPEAKER_00]: even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you noticed I went back to the
big mic and the big headphones today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just trying to put out a super quality
show while I learned the other microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was more comfortable with this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say on one of your recent
episodes, you said everyone thinks you are
[SPEAKER_00]: a psychic because you knew to answer the
air conditioning questions, but you've
[SPEAKER_00]: been dropping the exact episodes I have
needed at the perfect times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love hearing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love knowing that I put out an air
conditioner episode right when everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: room got hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love knowing that I put out an episode
about whatever you were thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: right at the right time you were thinking
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that life is happening as it is
supposed to, and I'm able to help people
[SPEAKER_00]: right at the right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that feels good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say, I've recently purchased
a couple of packs of your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a rise and double dragon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great selections, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plan to purchase many more build that
collection, brother, like Pokemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta catch them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I decided to pop the double dragon
seeds first and was very happy to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% germination rate on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says that he's got some less than
satisfactory results with other breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it says I was even more excited to
see that four out of the five turned out
[SPEAKER_00]: to be female.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full germination and a lot of girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the girls are growing beautifully
and are approaching week seven of flower
[SPEAKER_00]: currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will email you with some pictures very
soon as I know you would enjoy seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, please send me some emails of my
kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to see what they look like,
what they're wearing, what they're doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: how they're doing in school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me pictures of those seedlings,
those fucking week seven flowers now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't wait to see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, so back to you being a psychic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, psychic Jeff here at your service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Call me now for your free read in says a
couple of days after starting the double
[SPEAKER_00]: dragon seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought to myself, I wish Rasta Jeff had
a strain review episode on double dragon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went to check and it was like two
weeks earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had dropped that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I was psychic and ahead of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put it out there for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I decided I was probably going to self a
couple of these girls and create some S
[SPEAKER_00]: ones, something I've done before with
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was right about the time you're
feminizing episode, which offered me a
[SPEAKER_00]: plethora of additional knowledge on the
subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so our friend got some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I put an episode out about the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he wanted to self them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put out an episode about selfing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is working out pretty well for you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, then it says, I am rambling as I'm
sure you understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will get to the topic at hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, no worries about rambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody knows rambling, that is me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the ramble club hashtag.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like it when we ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys notice, I do keep checking my
phone cause I'm hoping to get some
[SPEAKER_00]: rambling in with white Mike today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just waiting for him to text back and make
no promises.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get to the, uh, rest of the,
I apologize for holding this email right
[SPEAKER_00]: in front of my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you guys are watching on the
video, I just blocked the whole camera
[SPEAKER_00]: with this paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to be professional here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say my question now is how
does female pollen react with different
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I throw some other girls of different
genetic background in with the plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm selfing, what traits and
characteristics should I expect the
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring to keep from the plant producing
pollen and the plant producing seeds if
[SPEAKER_00]: they are not the same?
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are not the same genetics,
that's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I assume they will still mostly be
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you were making, if you used a
reversed plant, a reversed female to make
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen, they should all be female.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did it correctly, if you selected
properly, if that plant is a true female,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it doesn't have intersex traits,
then you should have all 100% female
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know they should all be female,
but how does an F one notes, not an F one,
[SPEAKER_00]: which you were working with is an R one
and an S one.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you take that reversed pollen and put
it on a plant of the same cultivar,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is an S, you are selfing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've described this in another
episode, the selfing, the S one,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is when a plant basically fucks
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a crass way to put it,
but you'll never forget it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take pollen of golden goat,
put pollen of golden goat on golden goat,
[SPEAKER_00]: it just selfed itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fucked itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made S one seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all golden goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about if we take that
pollen and put it on other cultivars,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we took the golden goat pollen and put
it on a lemon skunk plant, we have now
[SPEAKER_00]: created lemon Jeffrey, that is an R one,
a reversal one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said tooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to edit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you guys to hear me say tooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took reversed pollen and put that
reversed pollen on a female cultivar and
[SPEAKER_00]: that made reversal seeds, R one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So S one, when it fucks itself,
that selfed.
[SPEAKER_00]: R one, reversal pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: R one, reversed pollen onto a different
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure you're never going to forget
that with those terms in your brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says they'll all be female,
but how does R one and S one differ when
[SPEAKER_00]: using male and female pollen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, if a plant is hemp and I
breed it to a plant that produces almost
[SPEAKER_00]: all THC, I assume I would find phenotypes
that express CBD dominance, THC dominance,
[SPEAKER_00]: and some that are mixed ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your input would be very valuable on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to read this on the next
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I got you up there pretty quickly,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says, thank you for keeping me
entertained.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for supercharging my grow with
excellent advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love your style and thank you for
breeding fire genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, this is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gives me an opportunity to talk a little
bit about breeding and everybody knows I
[SPEAKER_00]: love to talk about breeding and I don't do
it enough on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you take the pollen from your
reversed female, you want to know what
[SPEAKER_00]: traits to expect if you put that on
different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plant producing seeds and the plant
producing pollen are not the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you want to know about THC and
CBD ratios from different ratio parent
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take that reversed pollen and put
it on other cultivars, depending on the
[SPEAKER_00]: dominance of traits of those plants,
you are most likely going to see basically
[SPEAKER_00]: 50-50 crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take golden goat and lemon skunk
and you reverse that golden goat,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've done this before, put that reversed
golden goat pollen onto the lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes lemon Jeffrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at those two plants,
if you were able to grow those two plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never released the lemon skunk that
I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a very unique cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at that plant and you grow it
and you know it, and then you look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: golden goat and you grow it and you know
it, and then you see lemon Jeffrey,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see exactly which traits came from
which parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see it very clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you take that pollen and you put
it on other plants, most commonly you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get 50% plants that look like
50%, the mommy and the daddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to get, I should say
closer to 30-ish percent, because there
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to be some outliers,
but in the main scope of things,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to get 50% that look like 50%,
50% of the mommy and 50% of the daddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to get 25% that look like
the original mom plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to get 25% that look like
the original pollen donor, which we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: call the dad plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the three main phenotypes
you're going to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, depending on recessive traits of the
parent plants we use, we may see signs of
[SPEAKER_00]: the grandparents popping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever the grandparents of each of those
plants were, you may see some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to get the main three,
then maybe a couple of others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's probably going to be three
dominant phenotypes, one major phenotype,
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of secondaries, and then two
outliers that kind of come up is generally
[SPEAKER_00]: what I think you're going to see in a
feminized cross that you're putting pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: on other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very similar to crossing
non-feminized stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to find very similar punnett
squares, charts, results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's talk about the second part of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a plant is hemp and you breed it to a
plant that produces THC, and by hemp,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're just indicating that that plant
contains 0.3% THC or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a hemp plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got high in CBD, very little to
none THC in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to breed that plant to
King Solomon, who is very high in THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to happen there?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to find plants that are rich
in CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to find plants that are rich
in THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one did I say first?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to find the other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got stoned and forgot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to find THC rich plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to find CBD rich plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to find plants with crazy
numbers either direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the beautiful thing that will happen
is hopefully we will find outliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we find something that surpasses
both parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we find something with way more CBD
than the starting parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we find something with THC that far
surpasses the starting parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be our goal here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That number will be in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabinoids, in my opinion,
in my experience, the cannabinoids don't
[SPEAKER_00]: breed as solid as a lot of the other
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to focus on just cannabinoid
breeding, you kind of have to line breed
[SPEAKER_00]: for the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't look for growth and vigor and
flavor and structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to go for the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has not been my goal is breeding for
cannabinoids, but watching and seeing that
[SPEAKER_00]: is what I think you got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you breed one line that you go straight
up that line breeding for cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's CBD or THC, then you breed your B
line and you breed that one for whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking for flavor, structure,
whatever else you're missing from the
[SPEAKER_00]: other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once you've got those both solid,
how you want them, you breed those
[SPEAKER_00]: together and that's how you make a true
F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a long way to get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my experience, from what I've read
and seen, it's a little more difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to line breed to get the
cannabinoids exactly how you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're going to see a lot of different
combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see THC, you'll see CBD,
you'll see them down the middle,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then you're going to find outliers on
each direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then hopefully you find some
skyrockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that called?
[SPEAKER_00]: Transgressive segregation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be what it's called when you
find some plants that are way better than
[SPEAKER_00]: the parents that surpass the performance
of the parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Blue, I hope I answered your
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I went over that one pretty
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of quick, but I feel like I
covered it quite well.
