[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back, cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for episode number 128 of the
Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source
[SPEAKER_03]: for cannabis news, education, and
conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a new grower, if you're a
professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_03]: smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a
cannabis activist or even someone who's
[SPEAKER_03]: just curious about the current state of
cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast
[SPEAKER_03]: for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank you guys for joining me.
[SPEAKER_03]: As always, I want to send a huge thank you
shout out to my friends in the Mystic
[SPEAKER_03]: Roots Band for letting me use their music
on my show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to Kat, Coode, and the
entire Mystic Roots crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't cough into the mic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing happened there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never knew you did that freehand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always figured that was pre-recorded and
plugged in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, I do that at every episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I cough in the middle of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This time I had something in the mustache
that was going to make me sneeze,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I got through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, that voice joining me,
you might recognize that deep,
[SPEAKER_03]: sexy, soulful voice over there,
that Barry White guy over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good friend, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for joining us, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man, any time you want to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a great episode to have you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just realized that these episodes are
kind of recorded.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do two a week sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do three a week, and then I won't do
one for a couple of weeks, and then we'll
[SPEAKER_03]: put one out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They come out once a week, but right about
now is two years of recording this
[SPEAKER_03]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's our two-year anniversary,
so thanks for joining me on the
[SPEAKER_03]: two-year-ish episode, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is fun.
For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a good chance I was sitting here
somewhere around two years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's very likely and been hanging
out quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet the folks that have been listening
consecutively, consistently, I bet they've
[SPEAKER_03]: learned a shit ton of outdoor stuff from
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to learn a lot more today,
and the folks that have never met you are
[SPEAKER_03]: going to learn a lot about outdoor
growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our episode is all about outdoor growing
this time, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you guys are dabbed out,
because we're dabbed out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're smoking some turpex.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to give a huge shout out to our
friends at Elevate Glass in Colorado
[SPEAKER_03]: Springs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have their address written down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 517 South Tejon in Colorado Springs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you check out Elevate Glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all the commercials.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all the commercials for this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse, you haven't been here in a while,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: How have you been?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very busy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's good for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got some licensing happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got some big things going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm proud of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our MIP and our ... Fuck,
I can't remember the initials for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many initials in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our wholesale grow with no store
attached and a hash producing license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: BHO hash or water hash?
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_03]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't own the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the choice I would have made,
but ... It's still a good product.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not cutting any corners with it,
I can tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you tried any of the distillate
that's made from CO2?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard about it, and I did not know
that was made from CO2 oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: This here, this is Spherex.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm about to drop it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got two containers stacked up,
because it's hard to get that bottom bit
[SPEAKER_03]: out, so I just turned this one upside down
and put it on there, and it dripped into
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It did it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ingenuity.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's some Spherex.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's made from CO2 oil, and then they turn
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They use a fractal distillation process,
as far as I understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know exactly what that is,
but I know the basics, and they pull out
[SPEAKER_03]: the goodies, and that's what it looks
like.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll take a dab of it here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't do it right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just too much of a pain in the ass,
but we'll do it after the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll leave it here so we see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's made from CO2 oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it got some serious turps on it?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got some serious turps on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to crack this one open and see
what ... So now you're reaching for the
[SPEAKER_03]: clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the clear, honestly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the Spherex better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's clear from California.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Super Lemon Haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Spherex.
[SPEAKER_03]: OG Kush, and I liked the turps on this
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I prefer the Spherex.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to my friends in the clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are my homies.
[SPEAKER_03]: They listen to the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm honest about the things I smoke and
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost overwhelming, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost too turpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to take little dabs of that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take a big dab of something else and
dip it into that a little bit so that it's
[SPEAKER_03]: not so overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one, the Spherex, I could dab a gram
of it by itself and not cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: My throat doesn't burn.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's super smooth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So shout out to the guys at Spherex.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just got some free advertising from
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that happens when you make a good
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you make a good product, Rasta Jeff
will give you a shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, let's talk about outdoor growing,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's going good for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got the new, the business running.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time to grow some outdoor weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully people have access to some
clones or some seeds because now it's time
[SPEAKER_03]: to get those going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be a little behind if you're
growing from seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might be by now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess the first question,
when should we put our plants outdoors in
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado?
[SPEAKER_00]: Second week of May is kind of rule of
thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like the earliest I do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've put them out, you know, first of June
and they still yielded just as good as the
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that went out the second week of May.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get a little extra attention to catch
them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you got about a two week window that's
primed to put them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get them out by the first weekend of June
though.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you haven't done it by then,
carry them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm burping.
[SPEAKER_03]: Carry them out that weekend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get them started.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get them outdoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know offhand when we're going to
start the flowering season?
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of varies from strain to strain,
but typically it's around the end of July,
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of August.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that does change a little
regionally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dates when you put stuff outside,
the timeframes are going to be a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit different, varying from coast to
coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: California, you could put them out today.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's probably be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have friends on Instagram that they're
already out today.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been out for weeks, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're in Oregon and Northern
California.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're spoiled out there though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bastards.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't do it like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do crush it though.
[SPEAKER_03]: We figure out how to fix that.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So get them out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first week of June at the latest,
get them out there, get them ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully you've got some clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got some seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've had them sexed already.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if they're boys or girls,
get some plants healthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get them too big because they're
going to grow really quickly outdoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year, a lot of people weren't
prepared for the size of plants that they
[SPEAKER_03]: were growing and that shit got way too
big.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their camouflage got away from them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their fences were way too low.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit went crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good thing, but it's also a bad
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So be prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your plants are going to get really large
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure they're not root bound either.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really important.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you take them outside?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you put them in the ground,
I've noticed through my years of
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, root bound plants,
sometimes they go into shock going
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they go into shock in a way that
they want to start flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right away?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's no good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure they're not root bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the weather is holding or you have a
greenhouse or something, you can put out
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier than the second week of May.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also right now we're around 12 hours
light here in the first week of April.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you put plants outside, there is a
chance they can go into bloom and you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want that to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to re-vege, aren't they?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to flower, then they're
going to go back and they're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: re-flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hormones are going to be all fucked
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ugly ass plants, bad structure,
limbs break off and it's just no good.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't let them get root bound.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that leads me into my next question
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to ask you if we should plant
into the dirt outside or if we should take
[SPEAKER_03]: them outside in pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my preferred method, being kind of
a crunchy hippie, I like to plant straight
[SPEAKER_00]: in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's less work I feel like and the plants
just are healthier.
[SPEAKER_00]: But doing it in containers is very,
very possible too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year I did plants in 150 gallon smart
pots for the first time and I was really
[SPEAKER_00]: stoked with those.
[SPEAKER_03]: How big were your stocks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Gigantic.
[SPEAKER_03]: The size of your arms?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first and second round of plants that
got put in there got stolen by some
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucked thieves and plant rippers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't talked much about it,
but I had a horrible summer last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never mentioned it on the show,
but we talked about some people getting
[SPEAKER_03]: ripped off.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were one of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck whoever took Jesse's plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they didn't get as big as they... If
the first ones I put out there would have
[SPEAKER_00]: got left there, the stocks probably would
have been as big around as a two liter
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ended up about as big around as one
of these 16 ounce or 20 ounce of water
[SPEAKER_00]: bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was with about four and a half weeks
of edge.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were going to be beasts.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first ones that got taken,
they were my string government mule.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to tell us about government mule?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you an opportunity to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made by Chimera, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chimera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chimera, which is a company that's not
really an existence anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's still around though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just doesn't make seeds anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a deep chunk, Tom Hill's deep
chunk, crossed with a G13.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were growing the shit out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phenol I have is like periodica.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real short and stocky.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant that was in the 150 gallon
SmartPot last year, within maybe six weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: of being outside, or no, it didn't make it
that long, probably about four weeks with
[SPEAKER_00]: being outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was seriously eight foot tall,
six foot around, six foot, it was just
[SPEAKER_00]: beast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a strain that really beasts
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That big SmartPot was making it happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That leads me perfectly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You keep helping me out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're segueing into my next questions on
accident here.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we're going to put our plants into the
ground, do we just want to throw them into
[SPEAKER_03]: the dirt that's in the backyard,
or do we want to dig a hole and put some
[SPEAKER_03]: good dirt in there, some good soil that we
buy from the store, or do we just want to
[SPEAKER_03]: use the backyard soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if that's all you have,
you can use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't know, especially here in
Southern Colorado, native soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty dusty and kind of clay-like
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been killed off pretty good,
especially in residential areas and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't hold water well.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's dusty like that, the nutrients
that are in it, because it's shale-based
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, there's a shit ton of nutrients in
it, but it's not accessible to the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the structure of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically end up growing in a pretty-
Super salty environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the very minimum, to have pretty good
results, I'd recommend cutting your native
[SPEAKER_00]: soil with one part cocoa coir or one part
peat moss, and then one part native soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then one part worm castings or
compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: By default, that soil recipe pretty much
works everywhere, and you'll end up with
[SPEAKER_00]: some really great soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys wrote that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be your base, so then you can still
add extra amendments to that, also,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you wish.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can afford it and if you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like farmer recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Produce gets grown on that recipe,
like in the raised permaculture beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So can we throw that same recipe into
those 150-gallon smart pots?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually exactly what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I added a little more aeration to it and
maybe went a little bit heavier on the
[SPEAKER_00]: peat moss, but yeah, that's exactly what I
did, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It worked out great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stalks the size of football of two-liter
gallons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's huge, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish you had pictures to show me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to throw out a little bit of a
soil mix that I wrote down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would buy, if I were going to use
150-gallon smart pots outside,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's got to be a huge pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: How is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: About six feet around?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: About three feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a kid pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about that tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: About 24, 28 inches-ish?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a fucking kid pool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fill it up with jello and people wrestle
in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would buy some bagged soil-less mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not too picky about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever the store has, I like the roots
organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Tupper.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty much all the same shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You run a hydro store.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all the same different shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots has more aeration in it,
like your Fox Farm products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always feel like they need a little
perlite or something added to it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they need to be sifted because there
are sticks and shit in Fox Farms all the
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell are they doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd go with some bagged soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter what you use.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would definitely put worm castings in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the cocoa coir, like Jesse said.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it gives the plants a little bit
of, it adds moisture to the plant's life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their vascular system's a little more
healthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just seem more hydrated with the
cocoa in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they get more flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cocoa most definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it holds water differently than peat
moss does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're doubling down right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can use a little more nutrient.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need a little more nutrient with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to put perlite in there just to
keep it airy and fluffy and then it helps
[SPEAKER_03]: you not overwater.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially in outdoor situations,
you might get a rainy ass night.
[SPEAKER_03]: That perlite will save your life.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: The peat moss, or the peat, like you're
saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for pest prevention, we learned
this from our good friend Sean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Kingkola.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're listening, I like to mix in the
caranja meal and neem cakes if we're going
[SPEAKER_03]: outdoors just to keep those bugs away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of my personal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, you came real close to my
personal recipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you put some oyster shell in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: See?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm learning the outdoor from you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't do it myself, but that's why I
bring you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a trick on the oyster shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add, go to hydro store guy giving away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the feed store and get oyster shell
for chickens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been collected off the beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not ground up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's whole oyster shell breaks down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes it more time to break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So put that in as a bit of a time release
and then get the powder, powderized oyster
[SPEAKER_00]: shell from your local hydro store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got two different available times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get all the way through the season.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that you're a hydro store guy that
doesn't just make a shop at the hydro
[SPEAKER_03]: store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You recommend the feed store stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to pay for the shit too,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I want to mention.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can use bottled nutrients in your
outdoor grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're just going to throw the plants
into some soil containers or dig a hole in
[SPEAKER_03]: your backyard, you can go to the store.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can buy some botanic care.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can buy some nectar of the gods.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can buy whatever brand they've got
their A and B, their bloom feed solution,
[SPEAKER_03]: their bloom boosters.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can mix that up.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're throwing it into some outdoor
soil, you can actually mix it up kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: heavy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can feed it pretty damn strong with
that stuff outdoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do that if you're not able to,
maybe somebody's not able bodied.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're pretty healthy dudes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could do things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe somebody doesn't have the physical
capabilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can throw a few pots in the backyard
and mix up some nutrients and have
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody help them do that way instead of
having to mix up a big batch of dirt and
[SPEAKER_03]: plant these.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do that, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would just, as a ganja farmer,
myself an indoor ganja farmer and Jesse an
[SPEAKER_03]: outdoor farm boy, I think we'd rather lead
people into this way of mixing up some
[SPEAKER_03]: soil outdoors and letting nature kind of
do its thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of the guesswork out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This will promote pest prevention and a
healthy environment using those bottled
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrients isn't going to contribute to
plant health.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only going to contribute to big buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil recipes we're talking about here,
they actually help with the healing of the
[SPEAKER_00]: earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They contribute back to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make the soil better.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you leave there, that piece of ground
is better than it was before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suppose you can do that with bottled
nutrients too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just watch out for salt buildups and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not as friendly.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do grow outside, do it on your
land.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do it in some national forest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be an idiot like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clean your shit up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take your bottles inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Jesse said, make it better than when
you found it, just like when you go
[SPEAKER_03]: camping.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make it cleaner than when you found it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pick up some trash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out Four Pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have told the story on some of
the older episodes or the earlier ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few years ago, there was a gigantic
cartel bust here in the mountains real
[SPEAKER_00]: near here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have family land that neighbors the land
where they got busted on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hiked in after the cops just to check
it out and look around.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of trash up there was just
appalling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up on that mountain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost brings a tear to your eye to see
that up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it accessible to folks like us?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be trespassing.
[SPEAKER_03]: What if we went to clean it?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not really trespassing,
is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think Bob would say anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say four years ago that
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still hauling trash out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a pretty good hike from the road or
from where my cabin is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make a few trips up there a year and
haul some trash out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ridiculous how much was up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's ridiculous how much the cops
and the DEA left up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell the trash from the cartel
growers and you can tell the trash from
[SPEAKER_00]: the cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just left shit up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Dunkin' Donuts was from the cops and
the Beans and Rice was from the cartel?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's real.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my friend's dad was a police
officer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how much I'm supposed to talk
about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not a cop anymore so they can't
probably do shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was retiring at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: They called him and had him go stand there
and watch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once they raided, everybody ran but they
needed the teams to get up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The DEA and shit wanted to go and
investigate.
[SPEAKER_03]: He stood there and watched.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just made sure that nobody went in that
area.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said that he walked around and they had
little camps set up like stoves with beans
[SPEAKER_03]: and rice.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the food was from Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was all Mexican packaging.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were straight up making Mexican
dinner up there every night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the Miracle Can Grow containers that
I have cleaned up off there, they have
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexican writing on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no English on them whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like segueing into the things that
I have in my mind for the show on
[SPEAKER_03]: accident, which is fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you add anything to the soil mix
before we move on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you use azomite?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to write that down for next
year's lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like doing minerals so I do basalt.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is real similar to the Clackamas Coot
recipe from the forums, Build a Soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's old school, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't heard that name in a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basalt, gypsum, these are all things you
can find at your local garden stores,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially gypsum, dolomite lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all pretty easy to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I use azomite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those four combinations of minerals,
you got pretty much every single trace
[SPEAKER_00]: mineral in the world covered right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to make your plants terpy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to make them healthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to smell real well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then oyster shell, shrimp mill,
fish mill, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like aqua products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stay away from bone mill, blood mill,
slaughterhouse products.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would use kelp mill if that were up to
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to write down kelp mill for my
style, just for what I prefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use tons of kelp mill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alfalfa mill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, good for nitrogen.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alfalfa breaks down really quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can give you some of that real early
season boost to get them exploded to pot
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle sized stocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your plants are going to take up 90% of
their nitrogen during the vegetative phase
[SPEAKER_03]: of their lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, you don't want to overspike
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why alfalfa mill is good because it
breaks down so quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the middle of flowering, towards the
end of flowering, you don't want them to
[SPEAKER_00]: find a source of nitrogen that can eff
some shit up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make them taste funky and it'll slow down
the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just stretch the buds out a little.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll start to finger.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get the little fingers, fox tails.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said a minute ago, you cleaned up a
bunch of fucking Miracle Grow containers
[SPEAKER_03]: from that Cartel Grow site.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, if you want to Google the Cartel
Grow site, I'm sure you could find it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a Cartel Grow found in the San
Isabel National Forest area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Off Highway 165.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was about probably four or five years
ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was well covered by the news around
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: They threw out a bunch of Miracle Grow
containers, which tells me that they
[SPEAKER_03]: probably weren't growing super quality
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk for a minute about why we
should never use Miracle Grow or any
[SPEAKER_03]: Scotts type of product.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, Miracle Grow is made by
Scotts, which is owned by Monsanto,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is trying to force the entire world
to be force-fed seeds that are made by
[SPEAKER_03]: them, which are all GMO produced to be
able to be sprayed by their products that
[SPEAKER_03]: are made by them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're ruining a whole bunch of things
and not healthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just fucking talking in a circle right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're killing the bees.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're real.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about money for those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Science has shown they're pretty much
single-handedly responsible for the bee
[SPEAKER_00]: die off right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do not want to support any anything
with Monsanto in the first place.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we don't want to use any type
of Miracle Grow or Scotts products.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to buy stuff like that,
go to a hydroponics store, go to your
[SPEAKER_03]: local grow store, get a decent grow soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't go get like a turf builder at Home
Depot or at Lowe's.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people hate on the Fox Farm
brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's actually available at some
of the larger hardware stores like Ace may
[SPEAKER_03]: have Fox Farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fox Farm isn't amazing, but it's
definitely not bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to buy something at Ace or
Home Depot or Lowe's, get Fox Farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get the Scotts brand stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: ProMix is available at most of those
places too.
[SPEAKER_00]: ProMix is a good product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sunshine 4 ProMix?
[SPEAKER_03]: The Sunshine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Different companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty much the exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different proprietary blends of
Mycorrhizae and Inoculation.
[SPEAKER_03]: ProMix is good shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can buy that in bulk.
[SPEAKER_03]: They sell that in.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're doing some outdoor ProMix,
go get that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not bad at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mix it in these amendments.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be fucking golden out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about why not to use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, the obvious reason is that
they're Monsanto products, but they're way
[SPEAKER_03]: overloaded with the wrong NPK ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tons of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tons of nitrogen, way too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: That soil is loaded with these little ...
They used to be green when I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: These little green speckles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are time release nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, they're little time release
vitamins for the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: What sucks about that is you don't have
very good control of what you're feeding
[SPEAKER_03]: your plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: However often you water, those are going
to dissolve and your plant's going to get
[SPEAKER_03]: that nutrient.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want nutrients going to your
plant every single time you water.
No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to start getting salt
buildup.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to start getting crinkled
leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to see burnt tips.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your buds aren't going to taste funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't use that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't use any of that Miracle Grow
feeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to a real grow store.
[SPEAKER_03]: I recommend Botanicare.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nectar of the Gods.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen great results from Nectar of the
Gods recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to my buddy Steve Dufino.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you listen to the podcast
bro, but you grow with Nectar of the Gods
[SPEAKER_03]: and the stuff you grow tastes really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nectar of the Gods is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Botanicare is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've used advanced nutrients and I had
okay results, but I was more happy with
[SPEAKER_03]: Botanicare by a long shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not like Psycho at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Psycho brand, I do not approve.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of brands available at the
store.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's super hot right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't been paying too much attention
to the new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nectar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nectar's coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a while to get people switched
over to the line from my perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the retail setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Botanicare and General Hydroponics are our
biggest sellers.
[SPEAKER_03]: GH is definitely reliable.
[SPEAKER_03]: General Hydroponics, General Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mills pays the bills.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen some good shit with Mills.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned last week some things about
Mills that even this organic grower is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to give him a shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spence was killing it with the Mills.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was crushing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Spence with the Mills.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's doing a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biobiz is always good stuff, especially
for outdoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kana is a great line if you want to spend
some money.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're Dutch and they're well made.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jungle Juice is really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earth Juice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see the labels.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen it in so long.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really recommend, if you're going to use
bottled nutrients, I like to add Humboldt
[SPEAKER_03]: Honey.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good product.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got good stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to the Hydro store.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get yourself bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're confused, don't buy that stuff
at the hardware store.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try not to buy your soil and stuff at the
hardware store.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're a grow store somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, if you live somewhere where that
shit's inaccessible, maybe you're better
[SPEAKER_03]: off not growing there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to have real big balls to grow in
that area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to you if you're going to do it,
but we can't condone it and we can't
[SPEAKER_03]: encourage it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're only listening to this for
entertainment purposes where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's illegal, but also it's not immoral.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're probably a grown ass adult.
[SPEAKER_03]: You better be a grown ass adult listening
to this podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: In iTunes and Stitcher, it's an 18 and
over show, so hopefully you're an adult.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got kind of ranty there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, last year in our area, we live in
Pueblo, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the valley, but we are kind of in
a valley.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're surrounded by mountains on every
side.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in a bowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in a bowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great way to put it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other day, we were in the dust bowl,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was so much wind and dirt just
blowing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought my car was getting sandblasted.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was miserable.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was cold too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was weird, but it was super sunshiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was horrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in this weird bowl and we get really
strange weather changes and drastic
[SPEAKER_03]: weather changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today, I used my heater and my air
conditioner, both in my car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, me too, several times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, it's 749 in the evening and
I've got the front door open and two
[SPEAKER_03]: windows open.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I just heard the front door as I
said that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was really strange.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking for an open window.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of judged what the weather was
like.
[SPEAKER_03]: The weather changes a lot here.
[SPEAKER_03]: My point is this caused a lot of folks to
get powdery mildew last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of folks that grew outdoors,
their plants were riddled with powdery
[SPEAKER_03]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I'm getting at is you've been growing
outdoors for a lot of years now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your dad's been growing outdoors for 100
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to the old man.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, brother?
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you guys go about preventing and
taking care of powdery mildew outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Prevention, planting the areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have plenty of circulation around our
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't cram them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hollow them out in the middles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We clean, shape the legs up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that only goes so far though.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few products, Azimax.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't really recommend spraying anything
on a bud, but if you have to, you have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Azimax Green Cleaner, just good old H2,
or hydrogen peroxide, H2O2.
[SPEAKER_03]: 30% hydrogen peroxide diluted at about 20
to 30 mils per gallon will help keep it
[SPEAKER_03]: away, but it will not stop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: More organically, teas would help.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could even brew a tea with neem milk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Sean would tell you to brew a nice
compost tea with some Karanja and neem in
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're going to want a fungus
dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll disrupt the pH on the surface of
the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some plant teas you can make.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been experimenting with chamomile,
which is a natural herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: You find it in a lot of tea blends for
drinking hot tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's considered a weed in most of the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows naturally here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be able to wildcraft it in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just been buying it from the health
food store right now, but it's a natural
[SPEAKER_00]: antifungal and antifungal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it makes a tea that has a higher
pH was another thing I heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: With those two properties, it battles PM
pretty good, it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, added benefit of it is it's high in
P and K.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just another- You're going to help
increase trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually right now at my current run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave half my Yeti OG plants a tea made
of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm week five right now, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave half of them a tea made of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I gave the other half for that
feeding, they just got water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kicking back, seeing what's happening
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Going to wait and see what does what.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's always a good thing to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you feel about, is it Osa 28?
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like a really great- Yeah,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get the numbers mixed up.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium silicate, I think, or something
like that.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of growers I really respect are
preaching it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't used it personally yet,
but it's a different silica.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you mix it in with almost any of your
store-bought foliar feeds, it really
[SPEAKER_03]: increases the effectiveness of both
products, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've used it in conjunction with my
integrated pest management system,
[SPEAKER_03]: and my plants love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It helps the whatever you're putting on
the plants, it helps it stick a little
[SPEAKER_03]: better, I think, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It works like a sticker spreader a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got the consistency of dish soap,
almost, when you open up the bottle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always stick my finger in shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I'm not supposed to, but I want to
know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, what is this like?
[SPEAKER_03]: I smell it and play with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smell it and almost taste it sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I want to, but there's Soul
Synthetics makes some products that I
[SPEAKER_03]: would drink.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you served me a cup, if I went to the
Monte Factor and they handed me that,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd go, that's fucking delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Soul Synthetics nitrogen blend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get it on, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nectar for the God smells kind of good,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're very similar to Soul Synthetics,
I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Soul Synthetics and another brand
that I got some samples of, but there was
[SPEAKER_03]: a bunch of molasses in one of them,
and it just smelled so yummy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, oh, I can drink this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Humic acid and molasses together just give
me this yummy flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of that, full power, you actually
can drink, and it's actually good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a humic and fulvic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to label it as humic acid,
but it's actually fulvic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has something to do with labeling
laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no warning on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no real MSDS for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard Jeremy from Build A Soil talk
about drinking it, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what got me to research it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, this guy's nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is nuts, but he's got a lot of great
ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: He seems like a guy concerned about what's
going into his body.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the Dragonfly Earth medicine
products are consumable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's mostly just alfalfa and woop
juice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that shit, by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's such good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you need roots, use that Lush Roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just take your little baby clones where
the roots are showing and just roll the
[SPEAKER_03]: clones in that Lush Roots and then put
them into soil, and they'll be root bound
[SPEAKER_03]: the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fat flowers is a good one,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've run too big of a crop for the price
of Dragonfly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, most definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for a boutique grower, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's for three lights or less or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insect frass is amazing, but we could
never use it at either one of our works
[SPEAKER_00]: because the price it would take to make
300 gallons once a week of this shit is
[SPEAKER_00]: ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to give a shout out to a product,
but I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let's go for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big Time Exterminator.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems to be working.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I've got to say about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big Time Exterminator.
[SPEAKER_03]: This comes in a black bottle with a skull
on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Big Time Exterminator on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty rad.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's mostly organic, and it's approved by
the MED rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is very important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very important, and I feel like I've been
adapting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I run a personal home grow, a caregiver
grow for my patients, which is all legal
[SPEAKER_03]: and legit, and I can do whatever I want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody looks at it, but I adapted the same
MED rules to my personal grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of do, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they don't allow it there, then I got
to throw it away also.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no need for me to ... And it keeps
me learning here also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It keeps me prepared for both places.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife, Bernadette.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's been studying that list very good
and getting to know pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually really proud of her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Bern.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has head growers from some of our
clients calling her and asking her about
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and what they can use and what they
can't use, because she knows more about it
[SPEAKER_00]: than the head grower for these gigantic
grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: They email out lists to everybody in
metric.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get a list of all the new pesticides
and all that stuff changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're signed up for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I read it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I read it often.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: She tried calling the MED to talk to them
about it one day, and a certain lady with
[SPEAKER_00]: her name starts with an M, called her
back, and was not cool at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we called the Department of
Agriculture, and she ended up spending
[SPEAKER_00]: about an hour on the phone with the lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys are super cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Department of Ag is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope they're the people that actually
regulate us one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of my hopes and dreams.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gary had some great points on the show
that we recorded last night that hasn't
[SPEAKER_03]: been released yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody that listens to the show has
heard it by now, but you'll hear it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's some great things that go
along with that statement.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be entertaining.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: How the hell are we getting rid of that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Remind me again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we're mixing up some spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chamomile.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chamomile tea all over the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll disrupt the pH.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to make sure that we covered that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet adding some silica to that tea to
help raise the pH even more would probably
[SPEAKER_00]: be real killer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big time exterminator with some osa-28 in
there would be really effective on PM is
[SPEAKER_03]: what I would assume.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to try the big time
exterminator.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have it at the store, but I've never
used it.
Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flying skull.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have another one of their products too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember what it's called.
[SPEAKER_03]: The enzyme.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big time enzyme.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big time roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big time inoculate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should see the store.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just got a good shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are good products.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the big time.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one with coconut oil and some
other things in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really approve of that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, if you guys do, here's another side
note.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do have buds that have powdery
mildew on them, I know it sounds like the
[SPEAKER_03]: easy way out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not blast them and turn them into BHO.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't press them and turn them into rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want to taste your burnt popcorn
and powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen any powdery mildew rosin
yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know it's going to happen though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eventually it's coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made a joke the other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, well, since everybody learned how
to make BHO, nobody gets powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_03]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a sick truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: You never see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody's like, I lost a whole crop to PM
or yeah, we got PM.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, no, we have a whole bunch of
shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you see now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a few people, they think it's safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a scientist.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a chemistry student.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not qualified to give this speech,
but this is what I understand about the
[SPEAKER_03]: idea of blasting powdery mildew covered
buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some folks say that the PM will not get
through the screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good enough if it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it won't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it'll stay in the tube.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's right there pressed up against
the screen just like your coffee and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: not getting through and only the coffee's
coming through.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what is coming through, maybe not the
spores and not the mildew, but there are
[SPEAKER_03]: mycotoxins inside of those spores that
have been extracted just like your
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids and your terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been washed off.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're getting the mycotoxins which are
going to affect you in the long run.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you inhale the spores, you'll get that
sooner.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll get an infection in your lungs.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll get an irritation.
[SPEAKER_03]: The mycotoxins are going to take a little
while to infect your body and it's going
[SPEAKER_03]: to be different.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have fungus inside your
body.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got mycotoxins running around inside
your lungs now.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to get in your bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know enough about that,
but I do know that it's not a good idea
[SPEAKER_03]: because you're just washing the mycotoxins
off the mildew into your hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then people are going to make edibles
out of that hash sometimes and they're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to consume and eat that shit and
they're going to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is supposed to be something that
improves the quality of people's lives,
[SPEAKER_03]: not makes us sicker, not fucks us up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So please do not blast your powdery mildew
buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing that I recommend,
I've never done this, shout out to Sean
[SPEAKER_03]: and Jordan, that's all their, I don't know
what else to call them, Sean and Jordan,
[SPEAKER_03]: some friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: They say that you can take the 30%
hydrogen peroxide and put it in distilled
[SPEAKER_03]: water and you can mix that up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they say you can dunk your PM covered
buds or PM dosed buds in that and then
[SPEAKER_03]: hang them up and they will dry and that
will cure your powdery mildew problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm skeptical.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know that I can recommend that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If anybody has done that, email me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to hear what your experience
about with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard that you can wash your buds the
exact same way like your outdoor buds to
[SPEAKER_00]: wash the dirts and stuff off of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing that exact same thing, but without
the hydrogen peroxide, just water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go out there with the hose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anyone's done that, let Jeff know
about that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'd like to hear.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a friend named Donovan who was known
as DJ Danki online back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: He, I don't know if I'm supposed to say
his real name and his online name,
[SPEAKER_03]: that doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: He used to say that he would rinse his
buds off just like a week before harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, I'd just go in there and rinse
them off with a spray bottle and hose them
[SPEAKER_03]: down just to get all the dust off of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is a good idea because in my
opinion, all that dust that you kick up
[SPEAKER_03]: during the grow season, it's been windy as
shit out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: If people got plants out, if it's this
windy in the middle of the flowering
[SPEAKER_03]: season, people are going to have buds that
are just covered in dirt on one side.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going into your hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just going to blast that right into
the pot of gold right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dirt extract.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to taste like earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe cleaning off the buds is a good
idea in this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try it this summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds lazy, but in my personal grow
room, I quit sweeping around week six.
[SPEAKER_03]: The buds are getting sticky.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's real sticky and I don't want
to stir up any dust or dirt off of the
[SPEAKER_03]: floor into those buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will let it get kind of funky from
about week.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's not a lot of shit on the
floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not even eating snacks or anything,
but there are leaves and you spill soil
[SPEAKER_03]: when you kick pots occasionally and shit
happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I won't sweep sometimes from like week
six or seven until after harvest right at
[SPEAKER_03]: the end of harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll cut off all the leaves pre-harvest
and then sweep up and it is pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So cut down the plants, pre-harvest,
cut down the plants and then sweep up and
[SPEAKER_03]: clean up and start fresh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spray the whole room with hydrogen
peroxide water and fucking clean it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bomb it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clean it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Redo the flooring, fix all the ducting.
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be a whole episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: What to do between grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could probably talk for six weeks about
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Untouched subject a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've been going for about 40 minutes,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we gave the folks a decent start.
[SPEAKER_03]: All we did was tell them how to mix up
some soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So dig some big holes and put all that
stuff inside of it and then put your
[SPEAKER_03]: little baby plants in there about May 15th
to June 5th ish and then keep an eye on
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep them watered decently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your soil at least two weeks before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cover the top of the hole with plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Accelerate the composting process of the
raw amendments being broken down and being
[SPEAKER_00]: plant available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earthworms are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw some worms in there if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mulching is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your hole size too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of depends on the size of your
plant and how big it can get, but at least
[SPEAKER_00]: three by three hole and you only need to
go with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only need to go down about 18 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need to try to fill a fucking
six foot hole full of highly enriched
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets expensive quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a lot of work and it gets really
expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go get you some bales of pro mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good start.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, thanks for coming and being on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell everybody how they can follow you on
social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I, can I shout out mine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can follow me on Instagram at Jesse
grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you can hit me up on Facebook,
uh, if you know how to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can also check out, uh,
my podcast that, uh, um, I would have
[SPEAKER_00]: never started without being on Jeff's
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of, uh, and he's already taught me a
lot and everything, but, uh, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the Colorado dope podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's C O L O R A D O P E podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, right now we're just on sound cloud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then we're also on Facebook as the
same thing and our emails Colorado 420
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast at gmail.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you guys talk about on the
Colorado dope podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, cannabis, um, lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the other hosts is a 44.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he has special little flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to 44.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then our other, uh, 44 and two now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried calling them 45.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't think that was too funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we still love you, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're still on the team.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my good, uh, lifelong friend,
uh, despicable Derek, uh, uh, dank Derek,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you want to call him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dirty Derek.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, uh, is pretty involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that fish?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't heard him called fish in a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we all of us that have known him a
long time knows cousin too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all met the cousin first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's fish number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's backup fish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, he's real active.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and the local hip hop and music scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he adds that to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are quite a bit more unorthodox
than Jeff's very professional show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we cuss and talk about a few gross
things and chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we've done that on this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: 44 has been on this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: True.
[SPEAKER_00]: True.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember a moose knuckle episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clint's been here also.
[SPEAKER_00]: True.
True.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Clint.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you listen to the podcast,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do message me and let me know,
we got to get together.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you left something here last time
you're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it wasn't as virginity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that stole it from me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're going to wrap up the show on
that note.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, dude, thanks for coming and taking an
hour out of your day.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to take some dabs before you
leave, smoke some of the Sphere X.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, if anybody out there is interested in
sponsoring a podcast or if you'd like a
[SPEAKER_03]: product or if you've got a product,
you'd like us to review.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have any paperwork to read off of
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Going no script lately.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, it's so much fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free balling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free form.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got a product you'd like me to
review, I will not talk about free balling
[SPEAKER_03]: in the advertisement of your product or as
I review your product.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you've got a product you'd like me
to review, or if you'd like to advertise
[SPEAKER_03]: on the show, send me an email.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to work something out with
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think that's all I've got.
[SPEAKER_03]: Follow me on all the social media on
Twitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's at GFY podcast on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the grow from your heart podcast on
Instagram.

[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on all the crate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been at it for awhile.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that means a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I like your style.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on a lot of the social media.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should not be hard to find.
[SPEAKER_03]: So search me out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, interact with me.
