[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just packing up seeds I'll sit there I
got my head down but I got my air pods in
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm just packing up seeds and talking
to the crew I need someone to hang out
[SPEAKER_00]: with sometimes I decide to go to the
discord channel and hang out with the crew
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to everybody over there hanging
out right now keeping me entertained
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes I just pop in and take dabs and
I say I'm gonna go hang out in the discord
[SPEAKER_00]: for a minute or five and it ends up being
55 minutes to maybe a hundred minutes you
[SPEAKER_00]: never know how it goes with me all right I
am stunned and rambly let's keep me moving
[SPEAKER_00]: the next portion of the show is not the
best news I do have some terrible bad news
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate these parts of the podcast I've
been talking about the endo expo quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit the endo expo is the world's largest
indoor cultivation expo it is a
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation expo it's focused on hemp and
cannabis a lot of the leading nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: companies a lot of the leading light
companies any innovative company and brand
[SPEAKER_00]: and product that is trying to put
themselves into the market or advertise in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis and hemp space comes to the
endo expo a lot of your favorite breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: would normally be at the endo expo I
usually have a booth at the endo expo I've
[SPEAKER_00]: paid for a booth and at this time I do not
know if the Denver endo expo is happening
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately Chris the owner of the endo
expo passed away suddenly it was not
[SPEAKER_00]: expected I guess no death is expected but
rest in peace Chris you will be missed he
[SPEAKER_00]: did a great service to the industry in the
community but the owner of the endo expo
[SPEAKER_00]: has passed away at this time the endo expo
is up in the air the Chicago show was
[SPEAKER_00]: canceled the Denver show is up in the air
nobody will give anybody a heads up any
[SPEAKER_00]: details or anything I'm not sure how much
I'm allowed to say so I won't say too much
[SPEAKER_00]: here on the show but I don't have anybody
to contact for the endo expo anymore they
[SPEAKER_00]: are not responding to emails nothing is
happening so if you were making plans to
[SPEAKER_00]: travel across the country across the world
I've got friends this is why I'm saying
[SPEAKER_00]: this I've got friends that were planning
to travel from across the country or
[SPEAKER_00]: across the world from other countries from
all over the country to Denver for the
[SPEAKER_00]: endo expo in the middle of winter they're
making a big adventure a big trek and big
[SPEAKER_00]: plans I'm giving you a heads up and
warning if you are planning on attending
[SPEAKER_00]: the Denver endo expo you're spending money
making plans putting energy and effort
[SPEAKER_00]: into effort into that you may want to put
all of that shit on hold until further
[SPEAKER_00]: notice I do not know if the endo expo will
happen I'm trying to do a positive service
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to start rumors talk shit
create any sort of thing like that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: letting my friends and the community know
you guys are my crew it's important that
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody knows the endo expo may not
happen if you're spending money putting
[SPEAKER_00]: energy and effort into that slow down
don't waste your time energy money effort
[SPEAKER_00]: it may not even happen so unfortunately
there was a death there's nothing we can
[SPEAKER_00]: do about that we have to give the family
time and space and let them handle all of
[SPEAKER_00]: their stuff then the business will come
whenever they care to deal with the
[SPEAKER_00]: business right now obviously it's not the
time when the time comes they will do that
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm not talking any trash I'm not
creating any drama I'm letting you know
[SPEAKER_00]: don't spend your money your energy yet
because you might buy might buy a plane
[SPEAKER_00]: ticket book a hotel room might buy a new
banner and a bunch of special packaging
[SPEAKER_00]: and it might be a waste of time so don't
do that just yet I'll try to keep you
[SPEAKER_00]: updated as soon as I know something again
though truly honestly rest in peace Chris
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to make this sound like I'm
bashing anybody the man is gone there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of grieving to be done but also
business needs to be mentioned so mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: emotions mixed things going on there now

[SPEAKER_00]: into the main part of this podcast I feel
like I've paid all the bills done all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the housekeeping let's get to the part
that you signed in for the main topic of
[SPEAKER_00]: today's podcast in the previous episode I
talked about bud washing that was a
[SPEAKER_00]: process a practice of dunking our buds
into a solution of water and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly hydrogen peroxide in an effort to
clean those buds of any contaminants that
[SPEAKER_00]: may have stuck to those buds whether it
was dust powdery mildew we talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: bird poop and bug poop anything that may
have gathered on those buds during their
[SPEAKER_00]: process I said this was doable on indoor
and outdoor greenhouse garden you can do
[SPEAKER_00]: this on just about any grow then I
realized as I was watching the video and
[SPEAKER_00]: doing some editing I should have mentioned
that you can do the same type of process
[SPEAKER_00]: while the plants are growing while the
plants are still growing alive happening
[SPEAKER_00]: you can treat them with the same type of
solution if you do encounter a powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew situation in your indoor grow
environment of course the first step is to
[SPEAKER_00]: find what is causing that powdery mildew
it's probably a vapor pressure deficit
[SPEAKER_00]: issue a VPD issue you probably have either
too high or too low of humidity too high
[SPEAKER_00]: or too low of heat or possibly
insufficient airflow those are most common
[SPEAKER_00]: causes of powdery mildew so we need to
diagnose and correct the cause of the
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew the first thing you're
gonna do is freak out and want to fix the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants which sounds good but if you don't
fix the cause even if you fix the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: it's coming back in a few days so you
could do everything you could you could
[SPEAKER_00]: polish every single leaf but if you don't
cure the room correct the issue find a
[SPEAKER_00]: good solution or find a very good
preventative measure that you can apply
[SPEAKER_00]: other than the room then you're going to
keep getting it so let me segue into
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about how to treat with a hydrogen
peroxide or h202 solution for powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew first step of course is to figure
out why you're getting it try to correct
[SPEAKER_00]: the room that is going to be your own
adventure you're going to have to correct
[SPEAKER_00]: that maybe add some airflow maybe add some
fans correct your VPD do you have too much
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity do you have too much heat do you
have too much cool do you have big swings
[SPEAKER_00]: when the lights come on lights go off are
you getting big humidity swings humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: spikes humidity drops are you getting
crazy swings during the night during the
[SPEAKER_00]: day are your temperature swings drastic
during the night during the day if you can
[SPEAKER_00]: get everything sort of more stabilized
that will prevent the production and
[SPEAKER_00]: development of powdery mildew giving so
there are a lot of different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew so some people will say
keep it more dry keep it more humid keep
[SPEAKER_00]: it warmer keep it cooler unfortunately
there's a type of powdery mildew for all
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions if the plants can live in there
and thrive in there so can the powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew so can the bugs so can all the
other shit they all love the same thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just how nature works wherever you
want to put on flip-flop sunglasses take
[SPEAKER_00]: off your shirt wear some shorts and have a
good time so do the plants so do the bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: so does the powdery mildew it loves all
the same shit as us the thing that brings
[SPEAKER_00]: it on the most is those crazy drastic
changes and improper VPD now let me focus
[SPEAKER_00]: in on how to take care of it let's say you
see some powdery mildew happening let's
[SPEAKER_00]: say it's getting a little thick on the
leaves we got a couple of options in the
[SPEAKER_00]: last episode I talked about using 30%
hydrogen peroxide H202 is very similar I
[SPEAKER_00]: believe they will work at the same rates
and same consistencies and they'll work at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same efficacy as the word I'm
searching for in my head as I ramble my
[SPEAKER_00]: way to it so hydrogen peroxide and H202
will work just as well the good hydrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: peroxide the 30% not the stuff from
Walmart you've got to get the good stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: they may sell the 30% at Walmart by now
who knows but the good shit then the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: you normally buy I think is 3% so you've
got to get the better stuff and when you
[SPEAKER_00]: use either of these products here comes
the dad in me here comes the pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: trainer in me make sure that you use the
proper protective personal equipment when
[SPEAKER_00]: you were using these products they're both
caustic they'll burn your skin they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: burn your fingers they'll burn the living
shit out of your eyes I know you're saying
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna put these on the plants yes
we're going to dilute it very heavily so
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're using these bottles these
products please wear gloves and wear
[SPEAKER_00]: goggles or some sort of eye protection
most of you are going to ignore the eye
[SPEAKER_00]: protection please do it but please for
sure at least wear gloves when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: mixing and applying this product in the
last episode I focused mostly on the
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen peroxide and H202 because those
are what I would recommend for a bud wash
[SPEAKER_00]: if we're going to harvest the plants dunk
them into a product and then they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to dry and basically be cured and smoked
pretty soon from there that's why I was
[SPEAKER_00]: recommending the H202 and the hydrogen
peroxide those products dissipate
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporate they don't stick around very
long they're gone from your plants quite
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly so they are safe to consume they
don't leave any residue any aroma you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: never know they were there so that's why I
was recommending those those are very good
[SPEAKER_00]: to use as a preventative and corrective
spray as well so you see the powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew coming you can hit it with the H202
or the hydrogen peroxide I would start
[SPEAKER_00]: with approximately 10 to 15 milliliters
per gallon then work your way up I did say
[SPEAKER_00]: to use about 50 mils I think per five
gallons of water last time honestly the
[SPEAKER_00]: way that I measure it in a commercial grow
is I fill up a few five gallon buckets and
[SPEAKER_00]: I put just a couple of bloops in there the
bottle goes bloop bloop bloop that's my
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement one bloop if it's really bad
put a couple of bloops in there if you've
[SPEAKER_00]: worked with me you know for sure that's my
unit of measurement just a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: bloops per bottle don't do glugs just a
couple of bloops glug glug that's too much
[SPEAKER_00]: bloop that's enough I when you do it
you're gonna go it's a couple of bloops
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's enough you'll figure it out start
low go stronger go until the powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew is dissolving but don't bleach the
plants and be careful when you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: this increase slowly so mix up the
hydrogen peroxide or the H202 don't mix
[SPEAKER_00]: them together mix that up into your water
and then spray that onto the plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: just spray it directly onto the powdery
mildew try to wash it off this product
[SPEAKER_00]: will dissolve the powdery mildew at the
same time as washing it off at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time you're washing off all the other dirt
and contaminants that may have gathered up
[SPEAKER_00]: on these plants you're just giving them a
nice little peroxide bath and this is not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to damage we have diluted the
caustic products to a level to where they
[SPEAKER_00]: are not going to damage the plants but
they will damage the powdery mildew the
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew is much weaker than the trichomes
the turps anything else in there and those
[SPEAKER_00]: products are the trichomes are protecting
everything that we don't want destroyed
[SPEAKER_00]: the powdery mildew will get decimated by
these products so start off with around 15
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliters per gallon of water work your
way up if necessary I've gone pretty hard
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to encourage you to go too
hard now I was focused on those other two
[SPEAKER_00]: products because I was doing the bud wash
let's talk about some products that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: use as a preventative and as corrective
sprays you can mix the following products
[SPEAKER_00]: together but do not mix them with the
peroxide or the H202 the following
[SPEAKER_00]: products I'm going to talk about would be
destroyed by the H202 or the hydrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: peroxide you can possibly switch hydrogen
peroxide with zero tall in most cases as
[SPEAKER_00]: well let me throw that in there I forgot
to mention zero tall is a good product let
[SPEAKER_00]: me get back on track don't mix the
hydrogen peroxide zero tall or H202 with
[SPEAKER_00]: the following products but do mix the
following products in any way you'd like I
[SPEAKER_00]: think they will work great together in
many combos or by themselves or in
[SPEAKER_00]: rotations so let's talk about them a few
products I like for powdery mildew and
[SPEAKER_00]: fungicide and mold control in an indoor
environment a greenhouse environment or
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor is a product called cease cease is
very cost effective I don't have a bottle
[SPEAKER_00]: of cease near me I should have researched
to see what was in there it is a
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial bacteria that will gather on
your leaf when you spray it and it out
[SPEAKER_00]: battles the powdery mildew and this
beneficial bacteria does no harm to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant it doesn't hurt us or anything but
it does make it undesirable for powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew so you've laid a protective layer
over your plants by applying cease another
[SPEAKER_00]: great product that does a very similar
thing is double nickel you can apply
[SPEAKER_00]: double nickel and cease each at 45
milliliters per gallon of water both of
[SPEAKER_00]: these products are approved by the
Colorado Department of Agriculture for use
[SPEAKER_00]: in the production of recreational and
medical cannabis so cease and double
[SPEAKER_00]: nickel you can use those in a commercial
environment or in your personal grow they
[SPEAKER_00]: will work great for the powdery mildew
other things you can use a product called
[SPEAKER_00]: regalia is great for powdery mildew and
then also sometimes you can use Grandivo
[SPEAKER_00]: but Grandivo kind of makes a mess and I
would use the other three products first
[SPEAKER_00]: so cease double nickel and regalia are the
three things I would recommend for your
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew problem if it's getting out
of hand if it's getting thick if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: getting chunky hit it with hydrogen
peroxide h2o2 or zero tall but that will
[SPEAKER_00]: destroy the colonies of beneficial
bacteria as you have built up with the
[SPEAKER_00]: cease the double nickel the regalia and
the Grandivo so that is kind of a final
[SPEAKER_00]: resort sort of a thing or that's a panic
mode or a holy shit this is thick and it
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like frosted donuts in here sort of
attack but the h2o2 zero tall hydrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: peroxide will work one of those don't
don't triple double up on those products
[SPEAKER_00]: just use one of those they're costing they
will dissolve the powdery mildew it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: you need excuse me for the kombucha burps
you guys I'll get that under control we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: drink kombucha before the next episode so
other things that we need to do we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to apply either preventative or
corrective sprays we're gonna start off
[SPEAKER_00]: with things like cease and double nickel
or regalia and then if it gets too out of
[SPEAKER_00]: control we'll step up our game and use
hydrogen peroxide h2o2 or zero tall the
[SPEAKER_00]: good thing about the cease and the double
nickel is in most cases if you are using
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects they will not destroy
your beneficial insects the hydrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: peroxide and h2o2 is really going to piss
off the beneficial insects cease and
[SPEAKER_00]: double nickel they should stick around the
regalia I can't testify I do not know what
[SPEAKER_00]: the regalia will do to your beneficials I
have not tried that with beneficials in
[SPEAKER_00]: the same mix the cease and double nickel
I've done that with swarski's persimilis
[SPEAKER_00]: hypoaspis miles green lace wings I've done
with all those guys still around and they
[SPEAKER_00]: survive and live through it it doesn't
disrupt them so that's the cease and
[SPEAKER_00]: double nickel that you can do with the
beneficial bugs now other things that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can do we've got to put some work into
this you're going to have to correct the
[SPEAKER_00]: room then before we spray why not
defoliate if we just go in there and take
[SPEAKER_00]: off most of the leaves if those leaves
aren't there they can't be problematic let
[SPEAKER_00]: me back up it's we know what time it is
put on a mask you should probably already
[SPEAKER_00]: have a mask right it's in the car it's in
your pocket grab a mask put on a mask
[SPEAKER_00]: let's not fuck with this powdery mildew
too heavily without a mask maybe a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit but if the powdery mildew is getting
funky if it's getting thick why not put on
[SPEAKER_00]: a mask you might not want to breathe it
just put on a little just a c-word mask I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to say it I don't want to get
us in that category on YouTube but just
[SPEAKER_00]: put on a light mask just to cover it up so
you aren't breathing the dust because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna jostle those leaves rattle
the leaves you'll have it on your fingers
[SPEAKER_00]: let's just try not to inhale too much of
that powdery mildew let's put on a mask
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely put on some gloves so you don't
have sticky hands and powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: fingers and let's defoliate any leaf that
has got some frost on it just go ahead and
[SPEAKER_00]: feel free to pull it off why not those
leaves are contributing to the over humid
[SPEAKER_00]: condition in the room those leaves are
where the powder powdery mildew is hiding
[SPEAKER_00]: if there are no camping spots there are no
hippies camping so get rid of the camping
[SPEAKER_00]: spots you won't have spots if there are no
donuts there's no powdered sugar bro get
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of all those spots is really what I'm
trying to say so get rid of all that
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew stuff put that in a trash
bag burn the shit no you don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: burn it get rid of it put it in the trash
get that stuff out of the grows quickly as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible seal it up get it gone then after
we've defoliated then spray at that point
[SPEAKER_00]: then spray the room follow the appropriate
instructions on the container of whichever
[SPEAKER_00]: product you choose to spray and keep in
mind if you spray indoors add two hours to
[SPEAKER_00]: the reentry interval time because some of
those products you don't want to go in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room too early they're expecting wind and
sun to help break that down you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: that in the grow space add two hours then
ventilate the room if we are spraying for
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew these products all of the
products which I have listed we don't need
[SPEAKER_00]: those to stay wet for very long we want to
hit the plant and get the plants dry so
[SPEAKER_00]: don't put fans on them and dry them
rapidly but let's dry them naturally
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly get ventilation in there get some
air movement in there we don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: hurricane-like conditions but we want some
movement some airflow we don't want crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking rustling leaves but we want like
movement on the leaves want them rustling
[SPEAKER_00]: and not fucking when I'm jostling and not
rustling you know what I'm saying right
[SPEAKER_00]: don't don't fucking go in there destroy
the growth now just go in there and blow
[SPEAKER_00]: around a little bit and get it drying blow
dry its hair just a little tiny bit get it
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaned up but don't give it an
opportunity to build mildew with the
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture you just fucking sprayed in there
most of the products I mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely the peroxide the h2o2 and the
zero tall you can spray those three the
[SPEAKER_00]: day of harvest you could spray those all
the way up to harvest we're gonna do a bud
[SPEAKER_00]: wash with those anyway so don't be afraid
to use those all the way up to the very
[SPEAKER_00]: end cease and double nickel you can use
those quite late in flower they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to disrupt the flavor of your buds
are not going to cause any problems with
[SPEAKER_00]: your product I think those will work well
the regalia and grandivo I can't testify
[SPEAKER_00]: to using those very late I would use those
very early in flower if it were up to me
[SPEAKER_00]: so we're gonna defoliate we're gonna spray
we're gonna ventilate the room we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: get the room dry while we're doing this
we're going to wear a mask and gloves
[SPEAKER_00]: we're also gonna put on some good music
and spread some good vibes then spray when
[SPEAKER_00]: the lights are off or the Sun is down
don't spray with the lights on don't spray
[SPEAKER_00]: with the Sun up this will cause you some
problems a lot of little boys remember
[SPEAKER_00]: burning ants with the magnifying glass or
doing some maybe you burned leaves I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know what you burned but we did some
experiments in science class and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: kids we had a magnifying glass and the Sun
would hit it just right and you can move
[SPEAKER_00]: that fucker around and you could catch
shit on fire just think about the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: light or the Sun hitting a little droplet
those grow lights are super close to your
[SPEAKER_00]: to your plants in some cases especially
some of those new LEDs I've seen plants
[SPEAKER_00]: get little burns from it some people say
it doesn't happen some people say it's
[SPEAKER_00]: impossible I think it's very likely I
think I've seen it happen and it grows so
[SPEAKER_00]: spray when the lights are off or when the
Sun is down if possible please all right I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that covers my recap of treating
powdery mildew some stuff that I should
[SPEAKER_00]: have talked about in the last episode
honestly the main thing you guys is to
[SPEAKER_00]: correct the room have some sort of
monitors in there and oh another thing the
[SPEAKER_00]: products I listed nobody's paying me to
talk about those products nobody pays me
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk about sea stubble nickel regalia
grandivo H202 zero tall nobody paid me for
[SPEAKER_00]: any of that so that's something important
that I think I should say I was on the
[SPEAKER_00]: track to saying something else I don't
even know the fuck it was oh the most
[SPEAKER_00]: important part have some monitors in there
so that you know what's happening is it
[SPEAKER_00]: too humid in there is it too hot in there
I don't care if you use a pulse monitor if
[SPEAKER_00]: you use a PL grow unit minder unit I don't
care if you got a little kid in there
[SPEAKER_00]: taking notes all I do care if you put a
little kid in there all right let's be
[SPEAKER_00]: real maybe if you have an adult that's
paid hourly on a living wage and is giving
[SPEAKER_00]: meal breaks if they're in there all right
if you got a helper monkey in there that's
[SPEAKER_00]: reading a thermometer and writing down the
hourly notes and just keeping track of it
[SPEAKER_00]: have some way of knowing what's going on
in your grow when you're not there are you
[SPEAKER_00]: using a PL minder unit are you using a
pulse monitor unit what do you have in
[SPEAKER_00]: there letting you know what the conditions
are like when you are away are there
[SPEAKER_00]: drastic humidity or temperature changes
during your nighttime cycle are there
[SPEAKER_00]: drastic heat spikes or humidity spikes
during your daytime cycle is something
[SPEAKER_00]: going awry at a switch that's where things
really go weird is when you flip from day
[SPEAKER_00]: to night or night today is when you see
drastic temperature and humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: fluctuations those are the things that are
going to cause trigger influence and
[SPEAKER_00]: continue perpetuate your powdery mildew
situation so have something in there
[SPEAKER_00]: letting you know what is going on you
might not even know that it's getting 90%
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity right when the lights go off
maybe you need to get a blower or an
[SPEAKER_00]: extractor fan and hook that up and that
way when the lights go off that can run
[SPEAKER_00]: for 30 minutes or they sell another device
that plugs into the wall this piece itself
[SPEAKER_00]: plugs into the wall it's got a meter on it
and you tell it when it hits whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: percent humidity you set it to a meter and
when it hits that percent it triggers on
[SPEAKER_00]: and the power comes on so you just plug
your exhaust fan into that you hang the
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor in the middle of the room when it
hits 70% humidity this thing goes I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to turn on it powers electricity
to your extraction fan and it sucks out
[SPEAKER_00]: some humidity until that sensor says oh
it's 69% humidity I can turn off because
[SPEAKER_00]: he wants it at 70 and that thing clicks
off and it keeps you at 70 or below you
[SPEAKER_00]: could set it at whatever you want most of
the time those are a cap switch or
[SPEAKER_00]: something similar to that maybe that is
your solution maybe a dehumidifier on the
[SPEAKER_00]: same type of switch maybe both there are a
lot of options for fixing humidity and
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew but the main thing is
correct the room and how do you know if
[SPEAKER_00]: something's wrong in the room well we know
because we've got powdery mildew but how
[SPEAKER_00]: do we know when and how to correct it if
we don't have some kind of meter so if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to win your battle with powdery
mildew the first thing to do is to fix the
[SPEAKER_00]: room I would recommend some sort of
monitoring device to monitoring device to
[SPEAKER_00]: let you know what is going on in that room
it doesn't have to be something super
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive of course like a PL grow minder
unit a pulse monitor something in that
[SPEAKER_00]: same realm would be beautiful would be
excellent or you can get one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: hygrometers thermometers with the it just
keeps records for you it shows you what
[SPEAKER_00]: the high and what the low was those will
work but how do you know when that
[SPEAKER_00]: happened so something a little more
high-tech that you can keep some data
[SPEAKER_00]: would be ideal but get what's in your
budget and get what is within your
[SPEAKER_00]: technical means I understand some people
are not highly technical these days some
[SPEAKER_00]: of us just want to go in the garden and
get dirt under our nails and grow weed
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to worry about too much
monitors and stuff get what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable with because we do need to
know what is going on in the grow all
[SPEAKER_00]: right I think that wraps up my powdery
mildew recap section of this podcast I do
[SPEAKER_00]: have a couple of great questions here in
front of me this message came from our
[SPEAKER_00]: friend fat ankle foot and it goes a little
bit like this it says hey Rasta Jeff thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you for all you do I have a question on
reading the pesticide labels correctly
[SPEAKER_00]: that is always a good question says first
off is an indoor grow facility considered
[SPEAKER_00]: a greenhouse a nursery or neither you know
I'm not an expert on that part I guess
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trained by the Department of Ag
and I never asked that question I think
[SPEAKER_00]: when they wrote the pesticide bottles I
honestly don't think they have indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation in mind that's why I always
add that disclaimer to add two hours to
[SPEAKER_00]: your re-entry interval time because it is
a little bit different than all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: above it's kind of it's new it's what they
didn't expect us to put a bunch of lights
[SPEAKER_00]: in a warehouse so I don't think those
companies thought of that when they wrote
[SPEAKER_00]: those labels which I'm gonna get off on a
side tangent here that caused a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: controversy when it came to deciding which
pesticides we could use in Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: because there are a lot of weird things
written on those bottles and none of the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff specified what could be smoked none
of it was designed for smokable products
[SPEAKER_00]: really some of it probably was stuff for
tobacco and things none of it was designed
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis so we had to kind of develop
rules here with the Department of Ag and
[SPEAKER_00]: the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement
Division and the Colorado Department of
[SPEAKER_00]: Public Health and Environment and citizens
and growers and cultivators and industry
[SPEAKER_00]: leaders and all kinds of people got
together and made a bunch of rules on what
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides and what the fundamentals of
what pesticides would be allowed in
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial production so those rules
didn't exist they had to kind of create
[SPEAKER_00]: those rules now I could be completely
wrong that your indoor grow it sounds like
[SPEAKER_00]: a nursery to me but when I think in
nursery I'm thinking like outdoors with a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of airflow there's a couple of
nurseries in my neighborhood and they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't look anything like any indoor
commercial environment I've ever been in
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm gonna say it's not any of those
dude it's indoor is indoor considered a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse or nursery or neither I guess
neither is gonna be my answer it's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: a hybrid dude they like I said they didn't
expect this this is a whole new thing
[SPEAKER_00]: those pesticides were written before
indoor cannabis cult before they were
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed to discuss indoor cannabis
cultivation they knew it was happening
[SPEAKER_00]: they knew we were gonna use it but they
were just like what do you mean they grow
[SPEAKER_00]: weed with this and they just acted totally
like it wasn't happening because they
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't be involved so that's a really
good question and I wish I had more of an
[SPEAKER_00]: educated answer to that but honestly I
don't think they had indoor cultivation in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind when they started writing pesticide
labels maybe they do now but I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: they did then now there's more to this it
says my boss and I are having
[SPEAKER_00]: disagreements on your evergreen
information would you be able to clarify
[SPEAKER_00]: this I hope so buddy let's try not to get
you fired let's get you a raise and leave
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody as friends at the end of this
would you be able to clarify this yes I
[SPEAKER_00]: will do my best it says I'm trying to use
the evergreen concentrate product on our
[SPEAKER_00]: plants we have a root aphid problem okay
that's gonna work it says my boss says we
[SPEAKER_00]: would only be able to use one ounce per
two thousand and four hundred and sixty
[SPEAKER_00]: square feet because on the inside of the
pesticide label it does recommend and
[SPEAKER_00]: limit how much you should use per square
foot when you are applying this pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: but what they are talking about is a
canopy size space you are treating the
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone which is a completely different
ballgame a different plan of attack a
[SPEAKER_00]: different method you're playing by
different rules doing a different thing so
[SPEAKER_00]: they're talking about the rules of
baseball we're playing football they're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about leaf ball we're playing
dirtball here so let's change the rules a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit but I do want to continue with
reading it says my my boss says we can
[SPEAKER_00]: only use one ounce per two thousand four
hundred and sixty square feet we would be
[SPEAKER_00]: drenching into five gallon pots you're
gonna need a lot it goes on it says 15
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliters per gallon at a hundred and
fifty gallons is 50 ounces also how does
[SPEAKER_00]: square footage translate when using pots
it doesn't this is two totally different
[SPEAKER_00]: things that two thousand four hundred and
sixty square feet that you guys were
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about that is canopy space this is
root zone space this is a different thing
[SPEAKER_00]: you are not spray applying you are mixing
as a soil dredge this is a different thing
[SPEAKER_00]: a different application a different
purpose a different use a different plan
[SPEAKER_00]: of attack while I'm on that ramble do both
when you were doing the soil dredge also
[SPEAKER_00]: do a foliar spray just hit both that way
any bugs that are living down in the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: they're gonna try to climb up into your
bush into your canopy that way you've
[SPEAKER_00]: already hit there too they have nowhere to
go anything that's living in the bushy
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy part it's gonna move right back
down into the soil and they're gonna go
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck it sucks here and they're just gonna
die or move they're gonna pack up and get
[SPEAKER_00]: the fuck out of there so um it doesn't
translate to the best of my knowledge best
[SPEAKER_00]: of my ability best of my training there's
no translation it's two different things
[SPEAKER_00]: so it says I hope the message is clear
yeah the message is clear this was a very
[SPEAKER_00]: good convert I hope this is a very good
conversation between your boss and whoever
[SPEAKER_00]: else was involved in this conversation it
does say there's three people here I hope
[SPEAKER_00]: this was very friendly I hope I
contributed some useful information it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not a greenhouse it's not a nursery it's
an indoor grow facility and I really don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think they had that in mind when they
wrote your rules and then how does it
[SPEAKER_00]: translate it doesn't it's two different
things go ahead and do your root drench at
[SPEAKER_00]: the recommended rate of 15 mils per gallon
but also do a spray around the same dosage
[SPEAKER_00]: up top also at the same time fat ankle
foot wraps up the message by saying the
[SPEAKER_00]: first rule for using pesticides is read
the fucking label the problem is we've the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem we face here was three people read
the label and we've got three different
[SPEAKER_00]: answers I do appreciate that there was a
good debate in that grow space in that
[SPEAKER_00]: office space I hope I have solved the
problem I hope I've given you some useful
[SPEAKER_00]: information I'm glad that there was a
great debate and I'm glad you guys are
[SPEAKER_00]: talking that means there's some educated
smart people in there nobody was right
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody was wrong but let me know who was
right and who was wrong I do appreciate
[SPEAKER_00]: that three people in that cultivation read
the pesticide booklet because that means
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's probably three more people read
that pesticide booklet than a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation facilities unfortunately so
I'm proud and excited that you guys did
[SPEAKER_00]: that good job fist bump big ivory army
salute to everybody for reading that
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide book all right I think I wrapped
up this message I do have another one I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to get to and I'm quite rambly this
one ends up with thanks and hugs from fat
[SPEAKER_00]: ankle foot fat ankle foot big big thanks
big hugs big ivory army fist bump on to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure I got everything spray and
drench to win were the main notes that I
[SPEAKER_00]: wrote down all right let's segue right
into the next message this one came from
[SPEAKER_00]: Jay bags this one came from the I read
genetics website that's right on the I
[SPEAKER_00]: read genetics website there is a grow help
tab if you click on the tab that says grow
[SPEAKER_00]: help it will go to the grow help tab that
asks you several preliminary questions it
[SPEAKER_00]: asks what name to use what strain you're
using or growing if you're using LEDs HPS
[SPEAKER_00]: lights if you're going indoors or outdoors
what kind of medium you're using ask you
[SPEAKER_00]: all kinds of useful questions to help me
help you out Jay bags filled out all of
[SPEAKER_00]: those questions we don't need to talk
about a lot of that stuff because he has a
[SPEAKER_00]: great question that a lot of the other
stuff won't matter so we're gonna skip all
[SPEAKER_00]: of his environmental stuff and get to the
point it says the problem I don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: have a problem more so of a question
that's good bro cuz I have got answers it
[SPEAKER_00]: says I live in the Northeast my state
allows me to have 12 plants of any stage
[SPEAKER_00]: for my wife and I I typically clone every
plant I grow just in case I find a keeper
[SPEAKER_00]: yes I always preach to take a clone of
every plant in case you find that gem you
[SPEAKER_00]: need it again you don't want to be
heartbroken that you found the beauty of
[SPEAKER_00]: your dreams and she got away there will
always be a story you tell it goes on it
[SPEAKER_00]: says although I also like to grow
perpetually using four tents he explains a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of his perpetual cycle so he
describes his grow quite a bit he talks
[SPEAKER_00]: about his perpetual system then we get to
the part here that says I've got so many
[SPEAKER_00]: good seeds at the moment I would like to
stop cloning everything and keep growing
[SPEAKER_00]: from seeds then when I find a keeper my
plan is to revege for those clones which
[SPEAKER_00]: does make good sense I've done that a
couple of times because myself I am
[SPEAKER_00]: limited on plant count so you just flower
it out cut down most of the buds revege
[SPEAKER_00]: that bad dog cut a clone off of it throw
that original plant away your plant count
[SPEAKER_00]: never changed it went from one to one
still with that same plant it was a big
[SPEAKER_00]: plant now it's a clone so it does sound
like you have a sound strategy that is the
[SPEAKER_00]: way that a lot of people do it you grow it
out cut it down revege cut a clone start
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh with it that does make sense now
here's where we get to the anomaly of this
[SPEAKER_00]: process it says due to the limited space
can I cut down the root ball of a mature
[SPEAKER_00]: freshly harvested plant in order to revege
then he describes in detail meaning I
[SPEAKER_00]: flower and five to seven gallon pots can I
trim the root ball to fit into a two
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon pot with a little bit of fresh
cocoa and worm castings then begin that
[SPEAKER_00]: revege process I'm familiar with the vege
revege process because I've done it
[SPEAKER_00]: successfully in the past I always kept
them in very large pots yeah I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: will work you're gonna have to trim down a
lot of the plant don't leave a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant for your reveging just have two or
three maybe four or five little
[SPEAKER_00]: thumb-sized nuggets that you're reveging
don't leave a lot and this should work it
[SPEAKER_00]: may take a little bit longer for this
plant to revege but it should work it goes
[SPEAKER_00]: on to say it would be nice if I can keep
them in smaller pots long enough to snag a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of clones then kill off this mom I
know that's harsh no that's how it works
[SPEAKER_00]: it says but she had it coming yeah she did
she had that coming from the beginning and
[SPEAKER_00]: she should have known and I'm just playing
it goes on to say I dig the podcast and
[SPEAKER_00]: the help you have given me via Instagram
and then he wraps it up with this
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram name I'm not sure if he wants
that said here on the podcast respect if
[SPEAKER_00]: you want that said sorry I didn't say I
didn't want to get you blasted if there's
[SPEAKER_00]: no way to take it back once I do say it I
can't correct it it says by the way I know
[SPEAKER_00]: my humidity is high I'm working on that in
my grow because he did yeah but that's
[SPEAKER_00]: okay no stress on the no judgment on the
environment bro it has been a hundred and
[SPEAKER_00]: eight degrees here so my my my environment
is not correct either but we struggle we
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust we adapt we do what we can do no
shame in your game brother do what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing I get it I get it life is rough
right now it was a hundred and eight
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees today and then in like seven to
ten days I'm gonna be wearing a hoodie
[SPEAKER_00]: every day so that's kind of shit we're
growing with right now let me make sure I
[SPEAKER_00]: wrapped up all of this stuff here okay
there was one thing I did want to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: recap and mention here your strategy is
going to work you're gonna cut down that
[SPEAKER_00]: root ball real small also make the plant
real small when you do that so there's not
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot to support there would be much
better if you could have a bigger root
[SPEAKER_00]: zone so let me give you a suggestion on
possibly how to do that now I do
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that you were crammed for space
and I do understand that you're crammed
[SPEAKER_00]: for plant count I also know you've got a
perpetual grow so I don't know how well
[SPEAKER_00]: this will work for you maybe you've got a
veg space this may actually free up some
[SPEAKER_00]: space in your flower room if my ideal
works for you and if you understand where
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm headed with this I have done a full
podcast on returning our plants to 18 6 of
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting schedule right before harvest so
about 14 days at the most maybe 10 7 days
[SPEAKER_00]: before you harvest during the flush phase
if you flush that's also controversial now
[SPEAKER_00]: during the flush phase I talk about
turning the plants to a longer light cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: an 18 6 cycle basically a vegetative cycle
there's a reason for this light is the
[SPEAKER_00]: number one energy source for our plants it
triggers photosynthesis it makes
[SPEAKER_00]: everything happen so let's give it as much
light as possible at the end people are
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna say that will make my plants go back
into veg probably but we're gonna harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: in like 10 days and we're not gonna see
any revenge for at least 14 days and you
[SPEAKER_00]: cut them down and smoke them and enjoy
them anyway if you plan on reveging you
[SPEAKER_00]: can get ahead of the game by putting your
light cycle back on 18 6 7 to 10 maybe 12
[SPEAKER_00]: to 14 days before you intend to harvest
these plants if they do begin to revege
[SPEAKER_00]: cut them down right away but you'll notice
they may finish a little bit early they
[SPEAKER_00]: may finish a little bit beefier because
you're giving them more light more energy
[SPEAKER_00]: right at the end a lot of cannabis plants
decide to bulk up and beef up at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of the flowering phase imagine if you give
them a little push a little steroids right
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end when you normally cut the
nutrients now you're gonna give them more
[SPEAKER_00]: light and they're gonna go shabang so
you're gonna get possibly a bigger heavier
[SPEAKER_00]: beefier harvest by giving them a little
bit more light possibly also they may
[SPEAKER_00]: finish a little bit sooner so if you can
return your plants to a vegetative light
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle maybe put them you've got a
perpetual growth so you can't put that
[SPEAKER_00]: room on 12 12 maybe you can drag these
plants you intend on harvesting back into
[SPEAKER_00]: your flowering space and get your next
flowering run in there 7 to 10 days
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier and revege that plant so that may
help you out that's just an idea just
[SPEAKER_00]: something that I wouldn't be a friend and
wouldn't be a bro and wouldn't be a pro if
