[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start this podcast off
by talking about what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I've been taking dabs of Dosas and
Mimosa's live batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blend of bottle wash and
Tahitian punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the package, the flavor is described as
citrus, lavender, and champagne.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I really got the citrus flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The champagne is definitely abundant when
you hit it and taste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never got the lavender flavor or aroma,
but that is a good thing because I am not
[SPEAKER_00]: a big fan of lavender or lilac flavors or
aromas, so it worked out perfectly for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure if I went in a little bit hotter
or a little bit cooler, maybe I'd pull out
[SPEAKER_00]: that lavender, but I'm not going to try
because I feel lucky that I didn't get
[SPEAKER_00]: that flavor in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the back of the package, it says the
product does contain 68.21% THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've got a nice head buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm nice and rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm going a little bit fast,
but that may be good for a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to the Dosas and Mimosa's
live batter.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to read a few
Patreon messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get there, let's do a few shout
outs to a few members.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the Seven Ten Club are the
folks who support us on Patreon at the
[SPEAKER_00]: $7.10 a month level or higher.

[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon contributions made this new studio
set up happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you could tell I've got this
bright ass light in my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this brand new camera, slick new
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been over this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, let me know what you feel,
what you think of this new setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I sound good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I look good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I feel good?
[SPEAKER_00]: You tell me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email address is growfromyourheart at
hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, where are we going to go from
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to make some suggestions to you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't usually come on here and make
movie or video or TV show suggestions for
[SPEAKER_00]: you, but I feel like I would do you a
disservice if I did not mention how much I
[SPEAKER_00]: laughed at a new show called The Cabin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend Burt Kreischer has a new show on
Netflix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is called The Cabin.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first 30 seconds had me sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that I was not going to leave the
couch, the TV, the Netflix for the
[SPEAKER_00]: duration of however many shows were on
that fucking series.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sat there and watched them, smoked dabs
until I was unconscious and watched every
[SPEAKER_00]: episode of The Cabin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise you within the first 30 seconds,
you know exactly what you're getting into.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will not stop laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That first 30 seconds tells you exactly
what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sets the tone, sets the pace.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without gushing too much about my
friend Burt Kreischer, I highly recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: his show called The Cabin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to follow that up with
another recommendation and then we will
[SPEAKER_00]: move into cannabis content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend the Comedy Store
documentary on Showtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a huge comedy fan, a comedy nerd.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love standup comedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love comedy specials.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love comedians.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think laughter feels good.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's better?
[SPEAKER_00]: After you smoke a fat dab, what's better
than laughing your ass off?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can think of a couple things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to talk about those here
on the show, but laughter is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: best fucking things on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be in a terrible mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be sick as fuck and the
stupidest shit can make you laugh your ass
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for however long you're laughing,
you're not thinking about the dumb shit
[SPEAKER_00]: that's happening in your mind,
in your body, in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in tense times here in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a lot of stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to mention it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done enough mentioning crazy shit on
this show, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We need laughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think laughter is fucking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good for your soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good for your spirit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good for your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good for your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's recharging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's something you can laugh at you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the Comedy Store documentary on
Showtime will make you laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a comedy nerd, if you know who a
lot of those people are and who they're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about, it just may make you cry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very touching documentary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows a lot about the comedy scene,
the coming up of comedy, and it shows you
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a behind the scenes look of
something I'm really passionate about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're into comedy, if you want a
dramatic comedy thing, that you could
[SPEAKER_00]: watch, you're going to laugh at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your significant other will laugh at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You both may shed a tear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend the Comedy Store
documentary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enough of Jeff's recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about growing cannabis,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said I was going to read some Patreon
messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of great messages here
from friends who support the show on
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from a fine young man who
calls himself Yee Muffuckin Ha.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, he spelled it perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yee Muffuckin Ha is exactly what it says.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I do have a question to the best
of your knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has the strain name standing ovation been
taken or even ovation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, that's a great fucking name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me explain to you how he came across
this name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I was just glassing in the grow
room this morning and looking at all the
[SPEAKER_00]: praying leaves, seeing healthy,
happy plants, thinking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible results I have had lately and
just thought the name would be so
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate for so many reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're in there looking at the plants
in the morning, they've got their leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: up in the, in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fucking praying.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're giving you that standing ovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you said the name, I knew where the
inspiration came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I may have written that down
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to take credit for a name
that I don't promise you was written on
[SPEAKER_00]: the list, but I think it was standing o.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk about that in a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it says, I feel like you yourself
should take a bow as we all applaud your
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty good, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it says, and you know how it
feels when friends try your herb and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like, goddamn, and sometimes you
deserve a standing ovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus there's a linguistic connection
between arise and ovation that I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: was interesting, but I was high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you're high, but this is still great,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the best ideas come out of us when
we are baked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says if it resonates at all with you
and hasn't been taken, I hope you consider
[SPEAKER_00]: the suggestion much respect my dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so instead of using it for a rise,
how about also good idea, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bravo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give you fucking some cheers
for that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you get a standing ovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to fucking stand up and fucking
there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You officially literally got a standing o
out of me for that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so what we're going to do instead of
using it for arise, I think it would work
[SPEAKER_00]: better with orangegasm because I've always
tried to make hashtag O face a thing when
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm advertising orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never caught on, but now maybe that I've
said it out loud, it was mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my intention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hashtag O face for orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it would be funny marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried that when I posted it up to
Instagram, nobody even noticed that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: posting hashtag O face.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got overlooked, but, um, the standing
ovation, the O face, uh, that those could
[SPEAKER_00]: be different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could name a phenotype of the
orangegasm, the standing ovation or that O
[SPEAKER_00]: face.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just something that could go along
with the marketing for the orangegasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I'm going to use it as a
strain name.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's another breeder out there that
wants to use that as a strain name,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, it doesn't fit my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it kind of does, but I'm not going to
go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would be more of a phenotype
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we labeled that phenotype,
the Rasta Jeff cut, the mean girl cut,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the pungent cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you've got the standing O cut and
the O face.
[SPEAKER_00]: O face cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I find it would be more
appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate the feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate to reject your name here on a show,
but I do love that name suggestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just not for me right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it may come up in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody else beats me to it,
that's a great name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody should market that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to keep moving because I've
got a couple of great messages here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from our friend H G and it
says, Hey Rasta Jeff, I'm a big fan of the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've recently become able to supply my
own medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Due to largely your tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, man, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking, that's a hard sentence for
my brain to figure out what to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hard to read, but once I figured it
out, I'm glad you were growing great
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine and supply your own medicine
largely due to my tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes more sense when I said it out
loud again, you saved my summer 2019 from
[SPEAKER_00]: death.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I could rescue your summer 2019
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says on a recent episode, you and white
Mike, and I actually corrected you on that
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Jesse that said this on the
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it could have been Mike 90% sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse is the one that said what you're
going to talk about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, uh, you and Jesse talked about
how you guys used to cut around
[SPEAKER_00]: caterpillar damage, but now that you've
learned more, uh, you've learned more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you just cut that shit away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you please elaborate as to what you
have learned and some detail as to how
[SPEAKER_00]: your practices are different now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yes, in the outdoor episode,
we did talk about how back in the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we found a bud with caterpillar damage
in it, we try to cut that part away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we do things differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we would simply throw the damaged
contaminated buds away.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several reasons for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, now we're not greedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, back in the day we were, and I hate to
say it, we were black market growers where
[SPEAKER_00]: we had to do things sneakily and we didn't
have big facilities and every fucking gram
[SPEAKER_00]: counted to pay the rent and all the other
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's not such a cutthroat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is cutthroat, but there's also quality
assurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got, uh, less ego, less, uh,
less struggle, less strife.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the, uh, the mentality when
there's not enough to go around?
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to have that mentality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's enough to go around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have to try to market that
terrible product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not safe and dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not as greedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got better morals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got better ethics and everybody
deserves better, better quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff with the caterpillar damage,
the bug shit in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not Rasta Jeff quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not up to my ethics.
[SPEAKER_00]: My responsibility is to provide a better
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: My responsibility is to find that problem
and make sure that doesn't get to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're making a medical, marijuana product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it says medical marijuana on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people that are consuming this have a
medical condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's a broken knee or a
lung disorder, but I don't want to give
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody with a lung disorder,
uh, buds with fucking caterpillar damage
[SPEAKER_00]: in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to give them buds with
powdery mildew in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to give them buds with spider
mite eggs in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's my responsibility to have better
standards than that, than to just cut
[SPEAKER_00]: around it and give them the part that
looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just throw the part that isn't good
away and you save your reputation,
[SPEAKER_00]: you save your business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you save the patients, their patients,
the people we are growing for medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is their medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to make them sicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people consume the product that I
grow and create, they feel better and I
[SPEAKER_00]: get to watch them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to their house and we roll up,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, bro, I don't feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: My muscles hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mean that I was, that was almost
disrespectful the way I did that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's what I see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like fucking tin stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, my body sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking in pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, well, here, bro,
take a fucking dab and let's smoke this
[SPEAKER_00]: joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time I leave, they're like,
bro, so have a good day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming by.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their arms are waving around and their
neck is flopping because they're loosened
[SPEAKER_00]: up and they're smiling and they're having
a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to do that to somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me, myself, and my crew, I bred it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My crew and I grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We harvested, trimmed it, took care of it,
got it to a patient that didn't feel well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They consumed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That fills me with pride and all kinds of
other fucking amazing words.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of great things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get filled up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jubilation may be the appropriate word.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never used jubilation before.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it fills me up with all kinds of good
feelings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to feel good about what I'm giving
my patients, my friends, the people that
[SPEAKER_00]: consume the products I grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I knew that there was caterpillar eggs,
caterpillar shit, caterpillar damage mold,
[SPEAKER_00]: blood rot fungus in there, I wouldn't feel
good about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, and I'm going to use my buddy
old Doug as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Old Doug's not the healthiest fucking old
guy on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Old Doug could probably smoke some healthy
cannabis and be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we gave him some contaminated shit in
probably three, five, seven to 10 days,
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug's going to start coughing up weird
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug's going to tell me, bro, I just
haven't felt good for the past couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to go, oh man, I wonder if
it was because of that caterpillar weed
[SPEAKER_00]: that I sold him or that fucking powdery
mildew weed that I sold him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to feel like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to feel like shit about
anything that I do to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did enough of that shit head shit when I
was younger, twenties, early thirties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are shit head days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, I'm a fucking grown ass man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's time to do grown ass man things
and step up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the long way of saying I've
just learned a lot about myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: about my goals, about my ethics,
about quality, about maintaining a
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about making that extra eighth
out of the bag today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about making a long-term customer and
patient that wants to buy 365 eights every
[SPEAKER_00]: day through the next year because they
didn't get one moldy one from me today.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll buy 364 days in a row with
intentions to buy the next 365.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you sell them one eighth that they
find some bullshit in it, you just lost
[SPEAKER_00]: 365 eights worth of sales from that person
because there are plenty of dispensaries,
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, and other people distributing the
same product as us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to have high standards,
good quality, and you got to have good
[SPEAKER_00]: ethics and good morals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I went on long enough about
that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the tremors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually we said we used to cut that
part out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the tremors come in as the
quality assurance part of the cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people downplay the importance of
the tremors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think that the lead growers,
the fucking king, the cultivation team are
[SPEAKER_00]: like the, the Knights and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the trim crew are the peons,
the villagers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is in no way the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fucking trim crew is just as important
as the lead grower and the grotex,
[SPEAKER_00]: just as important as the security guard,
the manager, the owner, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: consultants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those tremors are quality assurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They touch every single bud that goes
through the cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We chop it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hang it up while they're cutting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They see it while they're cutting it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: While they're leafing the hanging plants,
they see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're touching it hands on face to face.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a closer relationship with some
of those plants than I do sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: because they've cut it up into little
pieces and got to hold onto it like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I saw it, it was in a pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fucking huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get to get up close and very
personal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're trimming it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a big magnifying glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably the size of an iPad and it
just sits right over the buds and they put
[SPEAKER_00]: their hands on their scissors under that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can see powdery mildew, caterpillar
damage, spider mite damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds, anything that may be in there,
they're going to spot it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are my quality control.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're quality assurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They touch every bud, every flower that
goes into your jar, past the tremors
[SPEAKER_00]: hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: They inspected it while they were trimming
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They saw that caterpillar damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the tremors are the ones that find
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where the quality control happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, if you're thinking that the
tremors aren't fucking super important
[SPEAKER_00]: without them, your ship will crash and
they are quality control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't buy machines and take good care
of your tremors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I'm coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm headed with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I am in spring outdoor flower
with a lot of caterpillar damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've caught so many and cut away so much
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have to do everclear extract for the
first time just for sanitary reasons
[SPEAKER_00]: because I see caterpillar dung everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time I'm reading this message,
you've probably harvested that outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was sitting in the pile, just
cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for taking a long time to get
to that message.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I hope I did answer your question
about cutting parts out and why we changed
[SPEAKER_00]: our methods because we simply grew up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've learned how to manage ourselves,
our businesses, and our crops a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more professionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that the people relying on us
deserve better than that from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we should teach people better as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lead by example.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a thing that I've been taught.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to keep going because I can get
quite rambly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more question for this
episode and it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, Hey Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for reaching out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I want to start by saying thank
you for the wealth of knowledge you are
[SPEAKER_00]: consistently sharing and thanks for taking
care of the audio as well as you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got all new equipment here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope the audio sounds as good as you
are expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I'm up to par.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still got to learn where to keep this
microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like right here is best,
but now it's in my view for reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some negotiating to be done,
but I do appreciate the compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you think about the new
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep mentioning video and I haven't said
the most important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not watching on YouTube at this
point, I highly recommend you check us out
[SPEAKER_00]: on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done some major upgrades.
[SPEAKER_00]: The video is now in four K.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks fucking super crispy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, I'm still learning how to
work the lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm learning some camera settings,
really like the way it looks on my screens
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully it comes up just like that on
the video, but I think you will appreciate
[SPEAKER_00]: the four K video and I will get some sun
on this shiny forehead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm used to wearing a hat, trying to adult
a little bit harder without the hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for all the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know let's stay focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you like the audio, uh, tell me what
you think about the video, not just you,
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody out there hit me on Twitter at
GF Y H podcast or send me an email grow
[SPEAKER_00]: from your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep me focused cause I'm high as
shit today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says another big shout out to your
flavor and high profiles from what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing on as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love hearing what you guys are able to
get out there in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you appreciate it, bro,
because some people have sent me messages
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, quit talking about what you're
dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't fucking care.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just showing off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're rubbing it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in a place where I can't get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all you do is piss me off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad that you appreciate it and
that you can live vicariously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to let you know what I smoked,
what I got to experience, what the flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: was like, what the Terps were like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I try to tell you, uh,
how it made me feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also that will give you an indication of
why I'm fucking talking so goddamn fast,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is from this doses in mimosas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got me firing on all cylinders.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is for damn sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good thing, but sometimes when I
smoke the T K D number 10, that one puts
[SPEAKER_00]: me like kind of chilled out and I get a
little bit slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I share it because I like
you guys to know, uh, kind of bring you in
[SPEAKER_00]: with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also some of my friends live near me
or in the same state and all over
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado, you can get the doses in
mimosas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe they're dabbing the same thing
and they'll grab a jar of it and go,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hitting the doses in mimosas with
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're both talking too fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I'm trying to do is bring you
in bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Share my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, I'm about to harvest some of my
plants and I've always heard mild bro
[SPEAKER_00]: science regarding hours of darkness prior
to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard you talk about your last few
days being 18 six, but I'm not sure I
[SPEAKER_00]: remember if you talked about darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some test results that seem to
show some different cannabinoid levels
[SPEAKER_00]: when harvested different, uh, during
different intervals of light deprivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that is accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're talking about is at the end
of harvest those last couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your plants say they go 65 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to put them for 65 days in
flower than 67, 68, 69 total fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what this guy is talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not uncommon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear about that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually 24 or 48 hours of total
darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy is going to go three full days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I guess that can't be a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, they're already in the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to herm out or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so he says he has seen different
cannabinoid levels, uh, from different,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, levels of light deprivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely agree with that and believe
that, uh, they're going to change and kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of freak out toward the end there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to see different things by
doing different things to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That completely makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I actually do 18 six for the last 10
days and I don't do a dark cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: a long dark cycle right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, most of what I'm growing is
either a phenol hunt run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to do something super
crazy to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do just 12, 12 or 11, 13 on my phenol
hunt test runs, my seeded crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all finish at 18 six, my smokable
flower runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, sometimes I do them 18 six for the
last two weeks or 10 days, but a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: times I don't have room and manipulation
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I have other things in the rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but most of the time it's 18 six for
the last 10 days if I can, but I don't do
[SPEAKER_00]: that longer, uh, dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're seated, I do them 18 six for
like fucking 30 full days, maybe even
[SPEAKER_00]: longer, but those are seated plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: My, my, my world is crazy when it comes to
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me keep focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't give any weird advice here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says I just toss my three plants into a
dark room for what will amount to 36 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: of total darkness prior to chop tomorrow
night after work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got 36 hours, not three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I misread that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, can you speak to the efficacy or lack
thereof of darkness prior to harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use my name if needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, shout out to my friend, Evan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Evan, you said in the beginning of the
message that you have heard a bunch of bro
[SPEAKER_00]: science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to back your bro science up with
a whole bunch of bro science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have testing equipment,
but I've got experience in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: My experience is as valid as a book,
as a lab, because I can see what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty observational.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but again, this is bro science from
things I've read and things I've seen in
[SPEAKER_00]: my own grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I understand is light degrades
terpenes as the powerful grow light is
[SPEAKER_00]: shining down onto your plants and hitting
your trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpenes are being, uh, disrupted,
volatized, destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there are other words that we can use
vaporized in the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So darkness would probably in theory,
increase terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ever go in the room during the day and
it smells like moist grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go in the grow room during the dark
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like fucking dank weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of gives me the belief that
something's happening in the dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just a transpiration or a
respiration thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there are more terps present in
that dark cycle because the heat and the
[SPEAKER_00]: light are not breaking them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dark for terp preservation is a good
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also heat breaks down your terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cold in there when it's not as
bright, it's not as hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that cool dark, you may be building up
more terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be a real thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, also I have experienced that some
cultivars do gain in density.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get tighter in structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds tighten up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get a little chunkier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have noticed that in like more indica
dominant, wider leafed purple kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will do that a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thinner leafed, uh, longer skinnier
sativa kind of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't do it as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, that's something that I've
noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I don't think your plants are going
to make more trichomes while they are in
[SPEAKER_00]: the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've only got 72 hours or 36 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's a day and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do produce more trichomes,
those plants have been in flower for days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been waiting for those trichomes to
get ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any new trichomes that pop up aren't going
to have time to ripen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we're going to see varying
test results in my theory, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, um, I think lab testing is the only
way you're going to get totally completely
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate information on what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not going to pollinate me and
let me produce seeds, I'm just going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get bigger and bigger and make bigger
fatter buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you turn off the sun, it goes,
dude, it's the fucking end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those buds just beef up and swell the
best they can at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got that darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that darkness provides more terpenes,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got that cool,
which provides more terpenes, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to get swelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get ripening of the
trichomes because they don't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: daytime cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant's just going to freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the processes aren't going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may help you ripen up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may help you get a little more density
and it may add to flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be strain specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be cultivar specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could just be very specific to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were like one out of seven plants in
your grow may love this.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many plants you say you've got,
you got three, one of them may hate this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two of them may hate this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all three may love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be based on the plant that
you were doing this with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in most results, it doesn't cause,
in most experience, it doesn't cause
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It causes more increased and density and
flavors and aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, my buddy, Evan, I do appreciate
