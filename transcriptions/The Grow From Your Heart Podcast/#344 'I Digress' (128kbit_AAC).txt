professional grower, if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker or a dedicated gatherer,
if you're a cannabis activist or even
[SPEAKER_00]: someone who's just curious about the
current state of cannabis, This My Friends
[SPEAKER_00]: is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you guys again for joining

[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
smokers and growers, roll up a fat spliff,
[SPEAKER_00]: put some fresh water in the bong or start
heating up that dab nail because it's time
[SPEAKER_00]: for a fresh episode of the Grow From Your
Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up podcast world?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to episode 344 of the Grow From
Your Heart podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to start the show off by
letting you know what I am smoking on
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking dabs of the Fatso Nectar from
Green Dot Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about the Fatso Nectar on the
podcast before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a combination of GMO and Legend OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's described as dark roast coffee,
garlic and fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's got a maybe a dark beer sort
of a flavor on the inhale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely got the dark roast coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's got the fuel on the exhale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It leaves a little bit of a creamy flavor,
a dark kind of a dark beer sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that garlic breath kicks in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got garlic and cookies at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a great head high, a face high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes to the eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Fatso Nectar is what I'm dabbing
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier I was taking dabs of some Cherry
Slider full spectrum extract also from
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Dot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a combo of Cherry Pie Kush and
Joseph OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor on the label is described as
Cherry Cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it tasted like a packet of
Cherry Kool-Aid or maybe Grape Kool-Aid
[SPEAKER_00]: with no sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's powerful in the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really hits the tongue with that cherry
candy kind of flavor, but there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: sweetness to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it didn't have the medical quality or
the high I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I followed that up with the Fatso
Nectar and it worked out to be a beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: combo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'm dabbing on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys are taking dabs of
something delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're smoking a blunt of something
wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's your thing, I hope you're
smoking a fat joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got the vaporizer going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wherever you are, whatever you're doing,
I hope you were getting heavily medicated
[SPEAKER_00]: with me today.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, let's get into a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to start the show off by reading a
couple of iTunes customer reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got two fresh reviews since the last
time I read them on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you'd like to leave an iTunes
customer review, it's really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using your iPad or your iPhone,
simply go to the podcast, open up the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast like you're going to play a fresh
episode, click on the available episode
[SPEAKER_00]: tab and then scroll down and eventually it
will bring you a menu that shows the
[SPEAKER_00]: iTunes ratings and reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a little tab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It simply says, write a review,
click on that and type in a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you think about the
podcast and I will read your review on a
[SPEAKER_00]: future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: While you're there, it gives you the
option to give me an amount of stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a one through five star rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, everybody that has left a written
review has given me five stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you to give me the amount of
stars which you feel I deserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I look forward to seeing your iTunes
customer review and I look forward to
[SPEAKER_00]: reading your review on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into some of these reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes from somebody who calls
themselves Ben Haute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I said that correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This review was left on July 26th.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline is a podcast that leads by
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, he gave me five stars and it
says, if you're interested in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: scene, this is the podcast for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rasta Jeff and Mike take a deep dive into
multiple cannabis topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each episode is guaranteed to educate and
entertain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Rasta Jeff's authentic excitement
and passion for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike and Jeff help keep me up to date on
the cannabis scene while helping normalize
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in my own life.
[SPEAKER_00]: They promote family, honesty and much
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Respect from Cali.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, big up from California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of things I want to touch
on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, he said Jeff and Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for acknowledging that Mike comes
on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike's got two kids now, so it's hard to
get him out of the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when he comes over, he's not in
the mood to record.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just wants to chill out, take some dabs
and have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to Mike for being on the show
when he wants to and for putting his
[SPEAKER_00]: energy into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dude, thanks for acknowledging our
deep dives into the topics, because I kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of do go deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to I usually focus one episode on a
whole topic and try to get you educated on
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we move forward and try not to
cover too much in one show as for multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to get that one topic thorough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you noticed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he said guaranteed to educate and
entertain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not a good student in school because
I was bored.
[SPEAKER_00]: If my teacher would have taken a minute to
make that class entertaining, I would have
[SPEAKER_00]: learned so much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like I keep your your attention
and keep educating you by staying
[SPEAKER_00]: entertaining, throwing a couple of jokes
here, say some silly shit occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just my personality anyway,
so it works out well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think my learning style is probably
similar to a lot of cannabis consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to have a joke here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to have some some light to the
heavy to make it enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to throw that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for noticing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for noticing my authentic
excitement and passion for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will never go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for noticing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and also we keep you up to date on the
cannabis scene and help you normalize
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in your own life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that we keep you up to date.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of think that a lot of my listeners
may live vicariously through Mike and
[SPEAKER_00]: myself and the other folks that come on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I try to give detailed
descriptions about what I'm smoking and
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the weird things that I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for noticing that, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, shout out to Mike and
normalize cannabis in your own life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a that's an interesting statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how you mean that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to know more about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we said they promote family honesty
and much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's all about telling the kids the
truth about cannabis and doing what needs
[SPEAKER_00]: to be done correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dude, thanks for the great review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the five stars, I really do
appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can get the iPad to cooperate,
we will move into the next iTunes customer
[SPEAKER_00]: review.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is left by somebody whose name is
I'm the dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up the dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: This was left on and this is not my friend
named the dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a very good friend known as Rob
the dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not from Rob the dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: But either way, shout out to Rob the dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: The the headline says ramble on brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you do listen to the show
because sometimes we get quite rambly
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, the customer review goes like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff, my man, I love the podcast and all
of the pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're referring to my Instagram
pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to follow me on Instagram,
it's I re underscore genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I post a lot of wonderful cannabis
photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just posted a picture of Black Cherry
Kim that has gotten over 400 likes in
[SPEAKER_00]: about seven hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a quality photo there on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, the review goes, I'd love to get
some shots myself, dude, all you've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: do is grow your plants, take good care of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get yourself a nice piece of material from
that's just I know, I know we had a
[SPEAKER_00]: listener say I shouldn't shop at Hobby
Lobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a fabric store, maybe
Karen's fabrics or whoever Suzanne fabric,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who the lady with a fabric
store in your town, but find her get a
[SPEAKER_00]: just a nice yard of fabric, hang that up,
put a light right above it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a decent camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just using a Nikon D 3200.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned the settings on it real well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned where to put the lights,
put your plants in front of a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: really colorful tapestries or backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take some great shots and practice man,
you'll get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's learning the lighting, the angles,
and honestly the settings on your camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get the camera figured out,
you'll be taking great shots.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also says your show is incredibly
informative and helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that's what we're here for,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he says keep it up, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always cool to find a fellow musician
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay iry and rock on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he signed his name Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Mike, it sounds like we could be
friends, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hang out, take some dabs,
play some music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, thanks for the great five star
review and guaranteed I will ramble on and
[SPEAKER_00]: I will keep it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, thanks again for listening to the
show and thanks to both of you for the
[SPEAKER_00]: five star iTunes customer review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you guys, I'm looking at the
tab right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to the grow from your heart
podcast, where it shows that you're all
[SPEAKER_00]: caught up on listening to episodes,
mine says I'm all caught up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly don't listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just delete them, but I've got to have
the show in the queue so that I can see
[SPEAKER_00]: when the shows pop up and I can get the
links to tweet them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you go where it says that you've
listened to everything and then you scroll
[SPEAKER_00]: up, you will see ratings and reviews and
you'll see that Todd is at the top here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He left a review four years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then right next to that, it says write
a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just click right on there and it
brings up the little screen to write a
[SPEAKER_00]: review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the top, it gives you the amount of
stars so you can right away click on five
[SPEAKER_00]: stars or however many you feel like I
deserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type in a title for your review and then
go ahead and leave your customer review
[SPEAKER_00]: right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then hit send and it will post and I will
read it on a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I'm caught up on iTunes reviews,
let's work on some emails and I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: knock out a bunch of emails because I do
have a large block of grow lessons coming
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I keep talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get a few other random
topics covered, get some emails out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: way, get a few loose ends tied up and then
we're going to really dive into a long
[SPEAKER_00]: block of lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the meantime, let's catch up on
some emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a great message.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was just at the top of my inbox
and it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Rasta Jeff, my name is Adam.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can say it on the show and I've been
listening to the show for a little while
[SPEAKER_00]: now and just have to say you do an amazing
job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Adam, thanks for listening,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate that and thanks for the
compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on to say, I'm going through my
first growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems to be going well, but I listened to
you talk about the humidity on the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was just wondering where you were
testing your humidity from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it floor level, plant level,
light level or above the lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting low to mid 70s around the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mid 60s above the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a five by five room with seven Girl
Scout cookies plants inside and I'm using
[SPEAKER_00]: a 1000 watt LED light and I have an
oscillating fan in the corner on low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for any help and we'll definitely
take a dab and give my mom a hug for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're already on the right path,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about the humidity in your
grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a really good question because
you've probably got just a small
[SPEAKER_00]: hygrometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the temperature and the amount of
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably, there's several different
versions of this device, but it's usually
[SPEAKER_00]: about the size of like a pack of playing
cards, like a deck of playing cards,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe the size of your iPhone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably hangs somewhere in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little sensor on it that
measures the temperature and humidity in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and it just hangs and it displays
and it probably only measures just a small
[SPEAKER_00]: area and most people aren't thinking about
how many readings that thing is taking and
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of area that is measuring in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really good idea that you
brought that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet a lot of people are thinking,
wow, I've never thought of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're gonna go move their hygrometer
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna go change it to canopy level
or they're gonna go put it at another
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I would recommend mostly paying
attention to about canopy level.
[SPEAKER_00]: About the top of the canopy down is where
you really mostly wanna focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the plants are is where you wanna
focus on the humidity level.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to vary throughout the room
like you're saying, but it's most
[SPEAKER_00]: important about canopy level down in
through the canopy of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about where you wanna focus on the
proper humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it's gonna be a little more
humid down low because you're watering the
[SPEAKER_00]: pots and that's where all the water is
starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be drier up above the lights
because the water is going to rise toward
[SPEAKER_00]: the light, but it's not gonna go past,
I'm talking about the evaporation,
[SPEAKER_00]: the condensation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not gonna rise past the light because
there's no heat point up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may get a little pocket of stale
humidity up there, but it's not gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: as humid above the light as it will be
near the plants and down low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would focus more on the humidity near
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it matters most is right
around the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if probably from the top bud down to
about 18 to 24 inches down through the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole section of the canopy, you probably
got like a four by four, a five by five
[SPEAKER_00]: area in which your plants are taking up a
square footage area.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I would mainly worry about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm gonna kind of shift gears.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would check the vapor pressure deficit
of the entire room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would move my equipment around and see
what it is throughout the room because you
[SPEAKER_00]: may have a hot pocket in one room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have not that kind of hot pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I know you're hungry and you're
stunned, but not that kind of hot pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have a hot pocket in one part of
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have a humid pocket in one part of
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to move that hygrometer
around, that thermometer around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to move it around the room and
see what's actually going on in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be clueless that you've got one
corner that's not getting any airflow and
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a bunch of humidity back there
and it's getting real hot back there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the rest of the room seems just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a great thing to bring up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just leave that hygrometer and
thermometer in one area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Move it around and try to get the whole
room ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way you're gonna get the whole
room ideal is by more airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got it pretty good over here and
it's just a little bit off over here,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can probably balance it out by moving
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need to bring in more air or
evacuate more air, but if you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty close over here and you're just a
little bit, if it's just stale on this
[SPEAKER_00]: corner, just put airflow in that corner
and get the air moving so you quit
[SPEAKER_00]: building that humid pocket over there,
or you quit cooking hot pockets over
[SPEAKER_00]: there, whatever is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the humidity and temperature are good
things to pay attention to in the room,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also that's going to add up to a vapor
pressure deficit that you're going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: to pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a math equation that I covered on
another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are websites on vapor pressure
deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not familiar with that,
that's something else to check into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now something else I want to think about
in this message is you're saying that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting low to mid 70s percent
humidity around the plants and mid 60s
[SPEAKER_00]: above the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 70% humidity right around the
plants and 60% humidity up above the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm curious, how long had it been
since you watered when you took that
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement, when you got that reading?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you just water or is it time to water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you just watered and you've got
that 70 and 60, you might be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's time to water and you're still
that humid in there, you're going to run
[SPEAKER_00]: into problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have a little bit too much
humidity in there and you're going to want
[SPEAKER_00]: to bring that down before you get into
late flower or you run the risk of powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew, of bud rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also you're just going to slow down
the overall growth of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it totally makes sense to me that
you're getting two different measurements,
[SPEAKER_00]: one by the floor, probably three or four
measurements, one by the floor,
[SPEAKER_00]: one by the pot level, one at canopy level
and one up by the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have different humidity
levels there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to use airflow
techniques to balance that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a grow tent or a small room,
it shouldn't be too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of small fans will make that work
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you're going to have to lower that
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You either need to evacuate some of the
stale air and get fresh air in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get a small dehumidifier in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some way you need to bring that humidity
down, maybe minimize the amount of water
[SPEAKER_00]: you were watering the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just something you can think about
doing, but you need to get that humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: down before you run into problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I look further into your email,
I'm just sitting here reading it again as
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have anything on top of the grow
room sucking out stale air?
[SPEAKER_00]: It says you've got a five by five room,
seven Girl Scout cookies, plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: a thousand watt LED, and an oscillating
fan in the corner on low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything sucking that humidity
out?
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need a can fan up top,
evacuating old air.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be my first
recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while your humidity is that high,
pay attention to your leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those leaves start sweating,
if you see moisture coming out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves heavily, then you're getting too
humid in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're started getting dry and looking
leathery, it's too humid in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a spot where two leaves are
overlapping and they start sticking
[SPEAKER_00]: together because it looks like they've
been pasted together, moisture came out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom of one leaf and stuck to the
top of the other leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now those leaves have kind of pasted
themselves together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because you've got too much
humidity in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to cause you problems and
you need to get that reduced as soon as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you get into flower,
that is going to cause you problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're growing Girl Scout cookies,
man, you're already fighting an uphill
[SPEAKER_00]: battle because Girl Scout cookies is not
the easiest strain to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the best part about cookies is when
you do it right, it is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will move off the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will come right out of the bag into
people's pipes and you will do just fine
[SPEAKER_00]: if you do it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope I answered that question,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to take readings from the entire
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can't get the whole room
dialed, then focus on the area where the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are in a small five by five area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shouldn't take a lot of effort to get
the room dialed in just a couple of fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I keep talking about that
evacuation fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need something to pull all there out
of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you start pulling that old air out,
you will see much more performance from
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good luck, Adam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know how that goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have any more questions,
feel free to send me a backup email.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys, if you'd like to send me an
email, my email address is grow from your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart at Hotmail.
[SPEAKER_00]: com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get right to the next message.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, What's up, Rasta Jeff,
I enjoy your podcast thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You definitely display a bunch of
knowledge and love to share it with the
[SPEAKER_00]: public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm here for, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the great compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for noticing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says highly appreciated by many,
I'm sure, because I think that your inbox
[SPEAKER_00]: is insanely busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get to another question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever thought to reverse a mail
and then have it pollinated by another
[SPEAKER_00]: mail?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we've thought of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to keep going with your
email.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, for what reason?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it will increase the chances of
finding crazy keeper males and perhaps
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe for some reason, increasing the
potency of the females due to genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: gender limitations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you'll understand what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit me back if you don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to hearing more about
the strains you've bred and don't say my
[SPEAKER_00]: name on your show, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: No dabs around here, but I can give my mom
a hug for you the next time I see her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love, peace and cannabis grease.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to scroll this right quick and
make sure that there's no opportunity for
[SPEAKER_00]: me to have said your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you included your name,
so I think we're doing all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not say your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get into your message here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He asked if I have ever thought to reverse
a male plant and have it pollinated by
[SPEAKER_00]: another male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about what that means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reversing a plant is when I treat a plant
with a I'm using silver thiosulfate is
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm spraying my plants with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use dried components to make my own
silver thiosulfate concentrate and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: dilute it to the proper ratio and then I
apply that to a plant and that will create
[SPEAKER_00]: a reaction in the plant that will trigger
a female plant to produce pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will make pollen sacks and pollen and
that female plant will produce pollen that
[SPEAKER_00]: does not have any male chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will use that pollen to put on
another female plant and that is how we
[SPEAKER_00]: make feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the short version, the very short
version of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this listener is asking have I ever
thought to take a male plant and apply
[SPEAKER_00]: silver thiosulfate to a male plant to turn
it into a girl so that I could do further
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments with that female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the answer is I have done the reversal
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have actually flipped a boy plant into a
girl to give myself an idea of what that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant would look like as a breeding
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I made an F2 generation or if I used
that male to breed to some of my female
[SPEAKER_00]: stock, it kind of gave me an idea of what
its traits would be, what its floral
[SPEAKER_00]: clusters would look like, what type of
aroma it would give, what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes it would give.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you a very good representation of
what the offspring is going to look like
[SPEAKER_00]: and what it's going to bring to the table
genetic wise in this new cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get to see kind of an advanced look
into the genetics of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have done the reversal to turn a male
into a girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now once I got that far, I did consider
experimenting, but I decided to reach out
[SPEAKER_00]: to a couple of peers and our friend Colin
Gordon at the Ethos Collective has already
[SPEAKER_00]: done what you were talking about doing and
what I was considering doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colin is a little bit ahead of me in the
breeding game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mind saying that Colin is more
advanced than myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's done it more.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got more space and he's got more
testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just a little bit surpassed me in the
breeding game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got nothing but respect for the dude
in his company.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just been at it a little longer than
me and I keep my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do everything myself and he's got kind
of a team.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a different approach to stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, Colin took a male and he reversed
it and then he played experiments with it
[SPEAKER_00]: by pollinating it with a regular male and
by pollinating it with a reversed male.
[SPEAKER_00]: He played several experiments and he said
that most of the progeny came out weak and
[SPEAKER_00]: undesirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure if he was doing inbreeding
or outbreeding or backcrossing or what he
[SPEAKER_00]: was trying to do with these wacky
male-female combinations and I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: if he was applying feminized pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if he was applying pollen
from the same male that had been reversed
[SPEAKER_00]: from the same cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure his combinations,
but I trust Colin's judgment most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when it comes to cannabis,
I trust Colin's judgment like 99.9% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some other times I've questioned
him, but when it comes to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: I trust Colin's judgment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he said that the offspring was
undesirable and I don't want to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: more undesirable genetics and I don't want
to waste time and space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am going to believe Colin that it
wasn't something that would be worth my
[SPEAKER_00]: time and energy again, but I have done the
first step and the reason I reversed that
[SPEAKER_00]: male was to see what it looks like as a
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to see what traits it would bring
to a breeding project and that's a really
[SPEAKER_00]: good way to get a preview.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a really good question and I
completely understand what you mean and I
[SPEAKER_00]: hope I answered your question
appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: The email goes on to say, I'm looking
forward to hearing more about the strains
[SPEAKER_00]: you've bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good because I've got a lemon
Jeffrey planned to be coming up very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Jeffrey seeds have been re-released
at the Helladank Seed Company,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm going to do a talk about that
strain very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't say my name on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I don't think you said your name
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even in the from because it's
just got your initials up there,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you say, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: No dabs around here, but I can give my mom
a hug the next time I see her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey bro, it sounds like you have caught on
to the routine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that's sparking a lot of people's
minds right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that aren't super familiar with
cannabis and breeding, they're sitting in
[SPEAKER_00]: their cubicle or they're driving in their
car.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty entertaining stuff to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the stuff I like to experiment
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reversing plants, advanced breeding
techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the stuff I like to get into that I
don't talk about a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got questions on that,
send me the questions at
[SPEAKER_00]: growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, thanks again for the great email and
thanks for sparking my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, let's get into another message.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message comes from somebody who calls
themselves Roasted and Toasted 420,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Rasta Jeff, get roasted and toasted
420 here coming from deep in prohibition
[SPEAKER_00]: land.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up out there in prohibition land?
[SPEAKER_00]: Be safe and be careful, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says, I've got a question for that
pot friendly cop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you guys have been listening to the
show for a while, you probably remember
[SPEAKER_00]: that several episodes back, I got an email
from a cop and I read the email on the
[SPEAKER_00]: show and then he replied and I emailed or
I did a email from a cop part two as an
[SPEAKER_00]: episode and he said he would be happy to
answer questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I've had a lot of podcast
content, so I haven't harassed him about
[SPEAKER_00]: answering questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of our listeners here has a
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to read this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about it and give you my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then hopefully our cop friend is
listening or maybe another law enforcement
[SPEAKER_00]: professional is listening or a legal
professional will hear us and they can
[SPEAKER_00]: reply to growfromyourheartathotmail.com
and they can give us some guidance on your
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, the question goes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always heard that you can lock your
glove box and if you get pulled over,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cops can't search the glove box or
trunk without a search warrant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always been unclear because if they
have probable cause and such, such as a
[SPEAKER_00]: dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm not certain on that rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never put my anything in the glove
box because that's where my license
[SPEAKER_00]: registration and proof of insurance are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess my license is in my pocket,
but my registration and proof of insurance
[SPEAKER_00]: are in the glove box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always figured if I tried to stash
something in there, I'm going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: pulled over and that's the first place I'm
going to reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've never put stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know a lot of people who have this
same mindset that if it's locked,
[SPEAKER_00]: they cannot go in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds accurate from my little trust
me, I am not a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even claim to play one on TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know shit about the law other than
I've watched cops a lot and I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: pulled over a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from what I know, if that's locked,
they technically cannot go in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, they're cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they've got any probable cause,
they can now search.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they say, well, I smell weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they can invent the odor of marijuana
and they can go through your car and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they can ask you to unlock that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I don't know what happens if you
refuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if they've got probable cause,
they can probably get a crowbar and break
[SPEAKER_00]: that fucker open if they want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't know the rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dog, if the dog hits on your car,
they've got probable cause and they can go
[SPEAKER_00]: through your vehicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the dog is definitely the loophole
there for law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I've noticed is if you've got
like a quarter of weed and they say,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, bro, just give me your drugs before I
call the dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if I call the dog, I'm going to
fuck you every way I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got like a quarter or an eighth,
maybe just give it to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because once they call the dog out,
you're wasting a lot of fucking time and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're pissed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes it's better just if you got a
couple of grams or maybe just throw it at
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what state you're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure your demographic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if that'll work for you,
but it may be better than getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking dog called and going through all
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you just piss them off doing
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I don't know the bottom line here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you lock, like I had a van that had a
drawer underneath the passenger seat that
[SPEAKER_00]: you could put maps and shit in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I kept all my paraphernalia
and my smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that little drawer under the seat
could lock.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know the technicalities on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I got pulled over if they
could say open that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably could because they would
just say, well, you smell like marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think there's marijuana in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's probable cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how it would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully somebody out there will chime in
and make me not sound so ignorant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grow from your heart at hotmail.com is
where you can chime in and update that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I've got cannabis in my glove box and I
get pulled over, can law enforcement
[SPEAKER_00]: require me to open my glove box?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the situation there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Show me a couple of examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know how that's going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is more to this email and it
goes, I also want to thank you for reading
[SPEAKER_00]: my email on your Thursday show as well as
some advice I took from your vapor
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure deficit podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been keeping my rooms at 68 to 72
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after I heard your podcast while at
work, I called my wife and asked her to
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust the air conditioner after she
adjusted, which was a week ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen my plants completely turn around
and now they are looking super healthy,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least the best they can since this
round I tried my hand at monster cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this listener, listened to the vapor
pressure deficit episode and decided to
[SPEAKER_00]: make some adjustments based on my advice
and his plants have completely turned
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's great news.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad your plants are working out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad my advice worked for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it means a lot to me that people have
enough trust in me to go change their
[SPEAKER_00]: entire grow based on some stuff that I
say, but it always feels good to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: message saying, Hey dude, I did your stuff
and it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that feels good to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad your plants are looking better,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I was able to help you out and
get you back on course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he goes on to say during the two
month veg cycle for the first week of
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, the leaves were mostly single leaf
bud structure type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now while budding, they have put on
normal growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that the hormones have all
leveled out and everything's going the way
[SPEAKER_00]: that it should.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he should have a decent crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason his plants were acting
funky, you guys, I don't know if you
[SPEAKER_00]: caught that he said monster cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is when you take a clone from plants
that are a little bit into flower a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more than a week, maybe up to 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen them go a little later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend it, but a lot of people
are doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems to be working for our friend
who is calling himself get roasted and
[SPEAKER_00]: toasted for 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they end the email with thanks great
for 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course you can use my name PS.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate helping me out with my
recent germination problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm looking forward to getting roasted
on that sweet dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey dude, I'm glad you're listening to the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad with my help you were able to get
your grow back up to speed and I'm glad
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is working out for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope we get some answers on this
glove box question, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, if somebody wants to send me
an email, the email address is grow from
[SPEAKER_00]: your heart at hotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one more email I'm going to read
tonight, but before I do that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a couple of quick Patreon
shout outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe a huge shout out to John Bendit,
Adam K.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always shout out to Tyler and a huge
shout out to Brett Cormier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the support you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get back into these emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one says, Hey Rasta Jeff,
my name, I'm not sure if they want their
[SPEAKER_00]: name said, my name is Justin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been listening to your podcast for a
few months now and I am just about caught
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey man, thanks for listening to all the
old episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you gone to YouTube and listened all
the way from episode one?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's quite embarrassing, but there's a
lot of knowledge there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They continue to say, I want to say thank
you for the wealth of knowledge that you
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to bring to the table on a
regular basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for acknowledging that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, good luck with that, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of weird that the thing that
works the quickest and most directly,
[SPEAKER_00]: you aren't even allowed to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it's great that you've got medical
marijuana, but it's kind of weird without
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's just law enforcement being
afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's keep moving with the email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, listening to you and white Mike
on a regular basis has inspired me to join
[SPEAKER_00]: my local normal chapter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the NORML chapter, the national
organization for the reform of marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: laws and try to push for reform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, I've been also moved to research
as much about this glorious plant as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have aspirations of being a grower and
breeder when it becomes legal here.
[SPEAKER_00]: After I got home from Iraq, I had trouble
sleeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I turned to alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard that story too many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also thanks for your service,
man, by the way, I became overly
[SPEAKER_00]: excessive, causing me to lose multiple
jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an all too familiar story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to my friends that introduced me to
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, great friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's who you needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finishing up my term of service as I
no longer needed to take P tests,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to stop drinking completely
along with other substances I was abusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also quit smoking cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly think cannabis has saved my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would agree with you that cannabis has
saved your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have several friends who have similar
stories to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you've ever listened to
the episode with Steve DeFino.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve DeFino is a veteran who's got a
grapefruit size hole in his back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could you could put a grapefruit in
there and put a piece of duct tape over
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could smuggle a grapefruit in on
this man's body where he got blown up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not making fun of the guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not being disrespectful.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would agree with you that you could
smuggle a fucking grapefruit on this man's
[SPEAKER_00]: body.
[SPEAKER_00]: He takes it very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he takes it well for the same reason
as you because he is able to consume
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis to ease his PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms, which is what was keeping you up
at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: The feelings, the thoughts, the
nightmares, cannabis is helping him with
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like it's helping you with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry if I'm bringing anything back
while I speak about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are the things that cannabis
will help you find relief from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't have the punishing effects
on your body, your social life,
[SPEAKER_00]: your family life, and your wallet as
alcohol does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alcohol has a lot of long lasting
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says here that you were abusing
other substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the alcohol was kind of your gateway
drug into some other bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because once we get drunk, we let down
our, our inhibitions or limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like, I'm already hammered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not just do this other next level dumb
shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, I already did level two dumb
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's level three it and it just starts
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like having good friends with
that supported you and also introduced you
[SPEAKER_00]: to cannabis really turned your life
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So man, thanks for joining the green team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, thanks for your service once again,
because it sounds like you really put it
[SPEAKER_00]: in and it kind of messed you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then thanks for being on team green
with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says, but I digress, which,
hey, that's just fine for this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the ramble stoner podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't mind a little digress.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, I actually had two questions for
you regarding information sources and your
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, first, I enrolled in a
horticulture program at the local college,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I wanted some more specific,
some more industry specific education.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've also enrolled in cannabis training
university.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if you've heard of it,
or if you can shed your opinion on their
[SPEAKER_00]: master of marijuana certificate art.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a couple of things I can touch
on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the horticulture program at
your local college is going to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: useful than your cannabis training
university education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is turning into a commercially
produced crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is commercial horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a higher commodity, a higher value
commercial horticulture product,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is a horticultural product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think taking a horticultural program is
going to be key.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do find value in the cannabis training
university because you're going to learn
[SPEAKER_00]: specific terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully they're teaching you market
stuff, not just grow things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you're learning the dispensary
side, the terpenes, the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you're learning body interaction
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you said, I was wondering if you've
heard of it, or if you can shed opinion on
[SPEAKER_00]: their master of marijuana certificate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not, that sounds a lot like a master
grower certificate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks really good on a resume,
but in social circles here in the,
[SPEAKER_00]: so Colorado kind of has a group of stuck
up cannabis industry people, growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders, industry folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a group of elitists and they slash
we kind of laugh a little bit at the term
[SPEAKER_00]: master grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's just a label.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what your paycheck says, or it's what
your job designation says, but the term
[SPEAKER_00]: master grower here is kind of laughed at.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of a douchey thing to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big egotistical thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the master grower over at this
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just sounds really funny to say,
don't say I'm the master grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if that's your title on your
paycheck, even if that's your title in the
[SPEAKER_00]: company in which you work, don't just
don't just say lead cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds a lot better or grow manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I digress at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks really good on a resume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you were learning and you can
actually apply what you were learning,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is great, but in social situations,
it's a little bit awkward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So put that on a resume that will be
helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know enough about their curriculum
to know what they're teaching you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they're teaching you how
to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they're teaching you how
to clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they're teaching you the
evolution of the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what you're learning there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully it's a broad education and it's
not just too focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's grow stuff, you'll learn more
through just getting in and grow and doing
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by taking that horticultural program
at the college, but it's going to look
[SPEAKER_00]: really good on a resume.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were hiring that would say,
Hey, this guy took a little extra and
[SPEAKER_00]: probably already knows how to cut clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have to teach him how to cut
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: He probably already knows what micro and
macro nutrients are.
[SPEAKER_00]: He hopefully has a little bit of pesticide
training that comes with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't know, but I would assume
that you have a little advanced training.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to look good on a resume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that may come in handy, but as for the
curriculum and what you've learned,
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't know what they teach there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't really have an opinion,
but any education looks good on a resume
[SPEAKER_00]: when I'm hiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would ask you questions about it
while we were in the interview room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the second question says, I want to
become more knowledgeable on as many
[SPEAKER_00]: different strains as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was wondering where you thought I
should look for reliable info.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is a Leafly a good source?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if not, any light you can shed would
be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Leafly is a decent source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leafly is not the best source,
but they have a lot of strains there and
[SPEAKER_00]: they do their research pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've actually got a couple of my
strains up there and they pulled the
[SPEAKER_00]: descriptions from magazine articles and
websites that featured my stuff and they
[SPEAKER_00]: got it accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what they put is mostly accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: My Capelton is up there and Lemon Jeffery
is up there and soon Arise should be
[SPEAKER_00]: listed up on Leafly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys haven't gone and submitted
Arise for a strain review on Leafly,
[SPEAKER_00]: please do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a whole episode on the Arise
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd appreciate the support there,
but Leafly is not a bad source of
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I do like about Leafly is that you
can read customer reviews on how it
[SPEAKER_00]: treated people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody bought Lemon Jeffery,
you can see that people wrote,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the best cannabis I've ever smoked
and this relieved my anxiety and people
[SPEAKER_00]: list things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when things are crowdsourced,
there's the opportunity for
[SPEAKER_00]: misinformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great on one hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a problem on the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sound like an intelligent person.
[SPEAKER_00]: The internet is a great tool for people
who are smart enough to filter out the
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would start at Leafly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would venture out to other websites
like seedfinder.eu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seedfinder is a great website that lists
most of the major brands and it's got like
[SPEAKER_00]: a family tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn about a strain,
you type in, we're just going to say Lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeffery because that's where my brain is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type in Lemon Jeffery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll show you that Lemon Jeffery is a
cross of Golden Goat and Lemon Skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on the same page, it's also going to
show you that that Golden Goat is a cross
[SPEAKER_00]: of Hawaiian Sweet Skunk or Island Sweet
Skunk, Hawaiian Sativa and Romulan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then right under that, it's going to show
you that Lemon Skunk is a cross of this
[SPEAKER_00]: and this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's going to keep breaking it
down for like 25 or 30 lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see the breakdown, the lineage
way back and see how it was made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like seedfinder.eu for doing research
on strains and finding what crosses are
[SPEAKER_00]: and finding the genetic lineage of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I like going to seed vending
websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you wanted to buy some iry genetic
seeds or you wanted to know something
[SPEAKER_00]: about iry genetics, you can go to the Hela
Dank Seed Company and just click on the
[SPEAKER_00]: strains that are available there and they
should have pretty good descriptions
[SPEAKER_00]: because they want to sell that and they've
got a relationship with the breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the breeder probably told them that's
this and this and these are the details.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've usually got fairly good
information most of the time with that
[SPEAKER_00]: same caveat that it's the internet and
you've got to be smart at filtering
[SPEAKER_00]: through the bullshit on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another place that I can highly
recommend to do research on genetics is
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know what breeder created that
strain, go to their website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, not all the breeders have an
up-to-date website.
[SPEAKER_00]: My website looks like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all of my current strains are up
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not versed in internet stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of friends that do that
and that are working on it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be updated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I focus on the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I focus on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: My website looks like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of the more established and guys
that have been around for a longer time,
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got great websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool has a great website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenhouse Seeds has a great website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, DNA Genetics has an amazing
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks like that have great websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can rely on the breeder website
because we're putting the info up there
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves and why would that be wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Leafly is not a bad place to check out
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seedfinder.edu, breeder websites,
and vending websites, the places that sell
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Helidank Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't endorse buying seeds from
overseas, but the Attitude Seed Bank has
[SPEAKER_00]: all the new shit listed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go see what they've got
listed there, you can probably find a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of genetic information there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, always cross-reference your
research when you're working with cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: because people are stoned and people will
believe fucking anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, if I told you I got this clone
from DJ Short and DJ Short got that clone
[SPEAKER_00]: from Ed Rosenthal in 1972 and then I took
that clone and I bred it, to wedding cake
[SPEAKER_00]: yesterday and I gave you seeds,
you're going to believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People will believe fucking anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people are really gullible and you can
tell them anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the stories get really convoluted and
shit gets really convoluted and distorted
[SPEAKER_00]: in the cannabis industry and there's a lot
of egos and dick swinging and dick
[SPEAKER_00]: slinging and shit talking and
backstabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stories get mixed up a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to know about genetics,
get as close to the breeder as you can for
[SPEAKER_00]: the information because the closer you are
to the source, the less that telephone
[SPEAKER_00]: game has been played.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like by the time you say, it's a blueberry
cookies S1, then somebody else says it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry cross to cookies and it's a R1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've already fucked it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're like, yeah, it's blueberry
cookies to, it's a blueberry cross to
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, oh, now it's really
changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just takes three or four conversations
before you've got a totally different
[SPEAKER_00]: cross with different traits and different
colors and a totally different
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation with somebody who's never
seen or grown the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how the cannabis industry
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would do a lot of research and
cross-reference things, but Leafly,
[SPEAKER_00]: Seedfinder, Breeder websites, and of
course, vendor websites are great places
[SPEAKER_00]: to do research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just occurred to me that I should
not overlook the power of social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to know about the newest,
hottest, most current strain that came out
[SPEAKER_00]: today, social media is where you're going
to find that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would follow some of the bigger
accounts on social media, follow all the
[SPEAKER_00]: guys I mentioned, DNA genetics,
greenhouse seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you don't support them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're not into what they've got,
but if you're interested in genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: those are the guys to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you follow DNA genetics,
greenhouse seeds, TGA subcool,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the other seed breeders are going to
start popping up in your recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you'll get to see all the new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys like Coma, guys like the Jungle Boys,
and there are probably 10 or 20 new
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders that just popped up on Instagram
just now while I was recording this that
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll want to follow that have got the
brand new hype shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to stay on top of all the
brand new current strains, but it sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: like you're a really intelligent person
and it sounds like you know how to do
[SPEAKER_00]: research and it sounds like you know what
you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think with the few links I gave you,
I think you're off to a great start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you're going to be a great
asset to the cannabis industry once it
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes a viable option where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he wraps up the email and he says,
thank you again for all that you do for
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very uncommon these days for people
to share information so valuable,
[SPEAKER_00]: free of charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are truly an inspiration and thanks
for the huge compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is free because I feel like if I didn't
do this podcast, I might explode something
[SPEAKER_00]: would go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a musician for most of my life
and I feel like if I don't play music
[SPEAKER_00]: every so often that I just get angsty and
my body gets tense and I feel weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the podcast has become an
extension of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't put out all this knowledge and
all this info, I feel like I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: selfish and stingy and something's going
to just blow up inside me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to put it out there and share it
with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for noticing and thanks for the
great email.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any more questions,
man, send me an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, that's all the emails
I am going to read on this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I start wrapping up the show,
I owe a huge thank you to a new friend of
[SPEAKER_00]: mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a great painting in the mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you follow my breeding work,
I recently bred a couple of new strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a pair of strains in there called
bebop and rocksteady.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my friends got a pack of the bebop
and a pack of the rocksteady.
[SPEAKER_00]: And grew it out and they were happy with
the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were kind enough to paint me a
picture of bebop and rocksteady.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of staring at me right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could tell they're nice and stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of surrounded by weed leaves,
but it looks exactly like the bebop and
[SPEAKER_00]: rocksteady that we remember from being
kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the painting is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a lot of purple going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love the color scheme.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did a really good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to give a huge shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dude's name is Matt Marsongo and on
Instagram he is M M A R S.
[SPEAKER_00]: A N G O M Marsongo on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you check him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, once again, thanks for the great
painting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thing is awesome and I truly
appreciate the gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you guys, now's the time when I
start wrapping up the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you support our friends,
